 This cook book is not designed for a busy, active person. The author dismisses the use of canned beans. Every recipe requires that you begin by soaking and cooking dried beans (an 8 hour process). It also assumes that you have access to specialized cooking equipment, like earthenware pots and paella pans. The one recipe that I made completely from scratch (including carmelizing garlic and fire roasting tomatoes) was definitely NOT worth the effort - it just wasn't that good. While I really like to cook, I don't have the time that this cook book demands 
 This is not a good album.  If, like me, you decide to go back because you love "Rise" ... don't go this far back 
 I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the "New Rudolph".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all 
 I wish L.M. Montgomery had stopped at book number seven. The joy in reading the "Anne of Green Gables" series was that they were so optimisitic, humorous, and full of hope and happiness. This book was such a downer that I wish I hadn't read it - but how could I know I'd wish that until after I'd read it? I loved the first seven books, but if you can stand not to read the final book of a series, I'd recommend skipping this one. It was a real disappointment for me. If I want to read history and stories about "the real world" (which I certainly often do), then I would choose a book that I expected to be about that. This book does not belong in the "Anne" series 
 What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.     
 I'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia. I had not seen this movie as a child; those that say it's faithful to the book must have read something other than Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, the kitsch value is considerable; cheezy music and costumes, pure 1985. That being said, the Jabberwock was pretty cool in that "Godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit" sort of way. Also, the set design was very handsome. It's too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn't have been more varied; everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional. The film that comes closest to Tenniel's original Alice illustrations is the 1933 Paramount b & w version; it's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on Turner Classics 
 I wanted a monitor for digital photography that was a little better than the bottom end offerings.  I decided on the Viewsonic.  When I received it there was a permanent green pixel right in the middle of the display, and a 3/8" light banding strip at the top.  Amazon was VERY helpful with the return process, even covering the return shipping.  It seems that bad pixels in new monitors can be considered 'normal', but right in the center is unacceptable.  I have seen this monitor in operation, and as long as there are no pixel problems, it looks great 
 While Conway's idea may have been in the right place, she unfortunatly did not do the required research. I am "Norse Wiccan" but luckily I did not base my Tradition on this book! (I was forwarned before doing so!)  For those interested in building a Wiccan Tradition that is Norse or Germanic based I suggest the following books:   1) Wiccan: Beliefs and Practices by Gary Cantrell    - Not Norse, but a very good Wicca 101 book to serve as      a blueprint.  2) Witchdom of the True by Edred    - Shows how Gardnerian Wicca has its roots in Traditional      Old English "Wiccecraeft" and the Cults of the Vanir from      Scandinavia who worshiped the "Lord and Lady" (Freyr       and Freyja)as there primary deities. YOU HAVE TO READ       THIS BOOK!!! It's availible from Runa Raven Press:       http://www.runaraven.com/  3) Hammer of the Gods by Swain Wodening    - This is a book Anglo-Saxon Heathenism, but if read the      above book, you see why it is nessesary.    4) Germanic Heathenry: A Pratical Guide by James Hjuka Coulter    - This is the ultimate book on Germanic Paganism. A must      read!  5) Northern Mysteries & Magick by Freya Aswynn    - Aswynn is Asatru but with a Wiccan past, so her stuff      tends to be more on the "Vanic" side. Worth a read.    Using the above books, one can build a "Norse Wiccan" Tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of Norse/Germanic Paganism, instead of the "fluffy bunny" and "New Age" stuff that Conway does with this book, which is basically a reprint of her Celtic Magic book with the names changed to Norse Gods and Goddesses 
  Jim Ross, A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, Second Edition (self-published?, 2004)  Ross releases the second edition of A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, rearranging the data and adding just under four thousand races over twenty-three tracks. While I realize that getting a large enough data sample to come up with a truly comprehensive version of this book would be a Herculean task-- it would certainly require a decent-sized full-time staff-- some of the tracks represented here are a bit confusing given some of those left out; Evangeline Downs, Penn National, Ruidoso Downs, and Beulah Park are all included, while Belmont Park is nowhere to be found. This, I would imagine, leads to a large number of confused Belmont players.  The book runs just over one hundred seventy-five pages, which is reasonable for a racing book of this price, but over half the book is nothing but charts and graphics. While there are some interesting ideas that warrant further study to be found within these pages, the fact of the matter is that the real meat to be found here could have filled a much smaller book-- or, perhaps, a sixteen-page pamphlet.  If you're a collector of horse racing books, you might want to add this one to your collection; otherwise, you can safely avoid it. * 
 	A foreign girl moves to North America, a place she was never suspected to have fit in, and manages to become the top student in her class. Ewa or Eva Hoffman was a thirteen year old, Polish immigrant when she arrived in Vancouver. She adapted quite well after a year of uncomfortable living. She became the Valedictorian of her high school, went to Rice University, and then Harvard. Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is a book not worthy of the reader's time. 	 	The main character in this book complained about her situation too much. Maybe Eva didn't want to move, but it turned out for the better. She was safer, she got a better job then what she was hoping for, and she got to experience a whole new lifestyle. Instead, Eva complained that she didn't fit in because she didn't wear make-up or because nobody understood her Russian jokes. The majority of the book was filled up with complaints. Another example would be how she was mad that her friend at college was just too stupid to understand her, but actually Eva was just over analyzing the situation. Everything that happened to Eva in America had a negative side to it, which the author always wrote about.  	This book was also very difficult to understand. The author jumped from time period to time period in an unsystematic way. At one point she was talking about high school, the next paragraph was college, then her childhood, then the boat voyage, and finally back to high school. The author could be talking about piano lessons in America and then she will write about her best friend in Poland and how much she misses her. If the book was in a regular pattern, readers may be able to understand her life story and maybe even enjoy it slightly.  	This book is completely uninteresting and it has no plot. The author basically wrote down a bunch of random events that don't form a story. Even if the book was in a sensible order it, the story would have no plot and it would still be perfectly boring. The author just tells a bunch or random events that happened. An example would be when she overheard her parents talking about books, then it was about her friend at a school for the arts, then the author moved on to a summer vacation. The author can move on to different events because this is a biography, but there is no sense in jumping from event to event without actually having a reason.  	Lost in Translation by Eva Hoffman is simply a book that should not be read unless absolutely necessary. Eva complaints were far too many, the book was difficult to comprehend, the book has no storyline, and it just isn't interesting.  A. Coffin 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 Not bad, but contains some errors. For example on page 29 thedescription of Radial and Ulnar loops is incorrect. You can'tdifferentiate between the two types unless you know which hand theycome from 
 Judging from the reviews below, I guess I'm in the minority.  I found some of her points good, but overall it seemed more advocacy that evidence.  (No, I don't work for the advertising industry.)  If you believe Ms. Schor, every conceivable problem with kids or teens can be traced to advertising.  Any everything is as bad now as its ever been.  If Ms. Shor was alive 50 years ago I'm sure her book would have been about the evils of Elvis Presley.  Doesn't that seem a bit overheated.  I can't possibly recall all the personal problems and social ills supposedly caused by advertising.  I'm sure I'll miss 30 or so but here's a shot.  Advertising causes in kids:  Obesity Aneroxia Bad body image Depression Stress Poor social skills Anxiety Alcohol abuse Illegal drug abuse Legal drug abuse Misogyny Racism Insensity to others Xenophobia Headaches Poor performance in school Apathy Lack of achievement Delinquency Rudeness Memory problems Poor memory skills  I could go on and on.  Gee, maybe some of these things have other causes?  As any teenager who has taken Psych 101 would say, "Duh."  
 Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.  She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.  Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, "Wow, this will fool 'em!" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery. 
 Just not worth it. This author keeps repeating the same formula and it's not working anymore. 
 The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money 
 The authour of this book seems to think that the only single females around are prosperous, white, and urban. The vast majority of single women raising kids do not fit this mold and are certainly worse off for not having a strong father figure in their life. A more apt title would be "How Lesbians and Feminists can Brainwash Chldren into Thinking Fathers are not Important".  I could not imagine how my life would have turned out without all the wonderful strong male role models in my family that were there to correct my wrongs and provid support when it was needed.  Single mothers can raise quality children if the situation dictats but why would you choose to exclude someone so important to a child's development.   Feminists started by toting equal rights, and they triumphed as they rightly should have. Now their agendas push for the abolition of the strong nuclear family and castration of the male youth in this country.  You wonder why American society is breaking down?      
 It took so long I had forgotten I had ordered it and almost bought it at a book store! Beyond that, the cover was horribly bent and torn, it was yellow, the spine was nearly shattered from use, and it wasnt even the same edition I ordered! Ugh 
 Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.   
 Was looking forward to seeing this film, quite disappointing. Joan Cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film. Once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing. Jennifer Anniston is usually pretty good, but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny, I felt. Just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line.  Not a film I will be watching again, sadly. 
 This book is by far not the best book that I have read on pirates.  It is written more for a woman who is feeling bad about her sexuality.  The book is an effort to list every woman, fictional and otherwise, that has ever had a role in maritime history. The book starts out by talking about ancient gods (yes, female gods) that related to the sea.  This discussion is better saved for a book on mythology because it was a good summary of female gods but it did not pertain to pirates.  The book moves on and talks about female pirates through the ages all over the world.  While this is somewhat informative I believe that the significance of these woman pirates in history is way overstated.  Female pirates were very few and far between, and many really shouldn't be considered pirates.  The best part of the book was the discussion of the most netorious women pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny.  These two chapters were interesting and informative but they were also burried in the book.  I would suggest a book that includes but is not limited to woman pirates because the fact is that there were very few woman pirates in history.  The last quarter of the book focused on the politics of the Jolly Roger.  This section helped to save the book but it often repeated and contradicted the first part of the book.  I noticed a few inaccurate statements in this section, but on the whole this section was well done.  This book is not a total waste of time, but it gets off topic and overstates things in my opinion.  Women have played a huge part in world history, just not as pirates 
 I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like "Prime Cut".  You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.  This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's "Lew Wasserman" type production deals 
 Although there are a few good recipes, I found this cookbook to be disappointing overall.  I'll start off with the good: The lemon tart recipe is not only delicious, but a breeze to make and worth the price of the book.  The chocolate sorbet is also delicious.  The quality of the paper and photographs are excellent, with many beautiful color photographs illustrating the finished product.  Now the bad:  There is at least one glaring typographical error in this book.  The recipe for Linzer Cookies calls for over 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of hazelnut flour and 1/3 cup of flour.  These proportions simply do not work.  I had to add at least 1 1/2 cups of flour to prevent the cookies from melting into puddles of butter in the oven.  Given that the cover price is $35.00 and the author is a prominent N.Y.C. pastry chef, this alone justifies the two star rating.  There simply should not be any recipes whose failure is not attributable to any individual person's taste preferences but to incorrect ingredient proportions.  In addition, for what it's worth, three other recipes that I tried (Apricot Tea Cakes, Pineapple Tea Cakes, Golden Banana Cake) tasted very bad in my opinion.    For a good cookbook containing French-style pastries, try "Paris Sweets," by Dorie Greenspan instead 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 I have just purchased and received Freundlich's book, James Earl Fraser.  The major complaint I have is that the black & white illustrations are among the poorest quality I have ever seen.  They are small, of low resolution and many have a fine grid of white diagonal lines running through the entire image.  Perhaps I received a defective copy, but as a collector of sculpture books I can tell you that this one is very disappointing, especially for such a pricey softcover.  I would advise potential buyers to be aware of the above especially if they are interested in BOTH a good biography as well as good illustrations (this is usually important to most sculpture lovers),  However, if all you care about is biographical text then maybe you won't be as disallusioned as I was.  Note: the only good illustration in the entire book is the cover photo of Fraser's American Indian bas relief (on the "Buffalo" US 5-cent piece).  James E. McKi 
 you'd be much better off to buy other volumes in the series.  This two-volume anthology is generally a two-thousand page waste of time.  Most poetry is consigned to oblivion for a reason!  What is here rescued is frankly not worth it, and the "literature" here is of historical  rather than intrinsic interest.  A monument to "inclusivity" and  "diversity," but full of poor writing, the Common Reader is here  advised to invest in Library of America's wonderful volumes of the poetry  of Frost, Stevens, Whitman, and, whenever they finally appear in the  future, Dickinson, Melville, Eliot, and Bishop 
 I bought this CD Player for my daughter for a Christmas Present.  The radio works fine.  The tape player works find.  But the CD player will only run 30 min. and then it turns itself off.  Something wrong there.  Won't buy another one.  I am very upset about this seeing my daughter lives far away from here.  Can't do much about it now.  So we are stuck with something that don't work 
 After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 For good or for ill I recently was asked to help pick out graphic novels for children of my library system.  I suspect I was asked this partly because I am under the age of 30 and partly because my brother-in-law is a comic book inker.  The upside is that I get to see lots and lots of new titles for kids.  The down side is that more often than not they're truly terrible.  I mean just awful stuff.  Now recently Scholastic has been trying to corner the market on quality graphic novels for children. Somehow they missed the "Babymouse" boat, but they've already given us "Bone" and "The Baby-Sitters Club" series.  It's not all good all the time though.  Recently a co-worker threw a series title, "The Black Belt Club" onto my desk and asked me to read it through.  I had no idea when I read this book just how heavily Scholastic was riding on it.  Already the first book in the series (this is the second) has been optioned for a film.  Go to the book's website and you'll learn about their hopes for an animated series, video games, the whole nine yards.  There's just one catch.  Unless the books become mighty popular, there won't be much point to all the hyping.  And reading it through I have no idea if kids are gonna go in for its "prose and comic hybrid" style or not.   	 Max has never felt completely at ease as a member of the exclusive Black Belt Club.  The club consists of four students who are sent by their sensei into the world to fight evil.  Pretty standard stuff.  After a disappointing demo team performance he returns to the dojo for a special assignment with his fellows.  There they are told by a mysterious magical Native American woman named Grandmother Dancing Feather that there's been an imbalance between the four elements in the world.  It's up to the kids to defeat The Hate Master (honestly, that's his name) and get the elements back in alignment.  Along the way, Max has to face up to his fears as well as his own sorrows.  But it's only through friendship that the four can join together and defeat their enemy once and for all.  The book is a combination of written prose and graphic novel elements.  In a way, Scholastic is banking on this series to be a kind of link between straight out comic books and straight out literature.  Like "Captain Underpants", this is supposed to bridge the gap.  The funny thing is, Scholastic keeps referring to this series as the "first ever prose and comic hybrid".  It says this on the book's webpage.  Now this is where it gets funny.  "Captain Underpants" came up with this style way way before Barnes ever did.  And "Captain Underpants" is produced by Blue Sky Press which is an imprint of... Scholastic, Inc!  So if Scholastic already has the real "hybrid" credited to their name, what the heck are they doing foisting credit to "The Black Belt Club" books?  Just weird.  Anyway, what was I saying?  Ah yes.  This new technique.  Well, insofar as it goes, it works.  The problem is not in the style but in the writing.  THAT, unfortunately, is where it begins to fall apart. 	 Since the first book, Barnes has kicked up the emotional conflict.  Her hero Max still has self-esteem issues and he sometimes doubts whether or not the three other members of the club are really his friends (a legitimate concern).  There's also an odd backstory where Max is taken care of by his gruff karate-hating uncle because his father is so often away on business.  None of that is really resolved in this book, however.  Apparently by the end Max has discovered that, "There was nothing better in the whole wide world than having friends!".  Also that, "love is stronger than hate".  No real innovation or new ideas here.  Barnes is perfectly content to rely on old overused phrases like these, when even a simple rewording could have conveyed the same thoughts without seeming overly trite.  And that, unfortunately, is the problem with this series itself.  It's just too simplistic.  There's lots of fancy action sequences, and the parts with Max on his own are fine, but the moralistic tone is more than a little preachy and self-serving.   	 Then there are the weird elements.  In this particular book, the kids are visited by a magical old Native American woman named Grandmother Dancing Feather.  What tribe is she with?  It apparently doesn't matter.  What does matter is that she represents a kind of condensed be-one-with-the-world combination of every pseudo-Native American teaching out there.  In the back of the book we're told that Dawn Barnes did some "personal studies" with a Seneca Shaman and a Ute Shaman.  She then takes the very very vague notion of "interconnectedness between themselves [i.e. children] and other living beings" and smooshes it into one big mess.  It's not that such ideas aren't legitimate.  It's that she's watered and dumbed them down in what she obviously thought was a kid-friendly fashion.  Then she takes the rather offensive route of having a magical person of another ethnicity guide the kids.  Even EVEN if Barnes had said that the villain was a coyote (which apparently he is) and then explained who coyote was to some Native American tribes THEN she might have tied together a legitimate myth with her video-gamelike storyline.  Instead she doesn't seem to want to spoil her tale with anything with that much depth.  Pah.   	 The plot of the book is taken directly from Barnes's belief in a teaching style she has dubbed, "positive dialogue response".  A November 1, 2005 issue of Entrepreneur said that this meant, "motivating children with praise rather than fear".  Therefore fear is bad in her books.  Anger's bad too.  Part of the problem with the book is that Barnes equates anger with hate, making both out to be bad.  I'm all for the "hate is bad" part, but anger has a real use in this world.  It can be used to fight injustice, for example.  Blas people, for all their charms, won't go fighting for what is right if they don't feel angry with the situation at hand.  Barnes doesn't quite acknowledge this and the book suffers. 	 Now Dawn Barnes (who bears a truly frightening resemblance to the Sensei featured in the books) has the credentials to pen this kind of "novel with action graphics".  She's called the "Martha Stewart of Karate" in her own press releases.  Already the Director of Children's Education for the National Association of Professional Martial Artists (does that make her a DOCENAPMA?) she's apparently a third-degree black belt.  A Beverly Hills former ballerina black-belt, but a black belt all the same. A quick gander at her website at this moment in time shows that not much has happened with the book series since it sold its film rights back in July of 2005.  In spite of its novel appearance, I wouldn't expect much more to happen either. 	 When it comes down to it, you can have a good idea for a kind of book, a good set of nonviolent attitudes, factual information on a karate technique, and still end up with a not-so-hotso book simply because the writing is sub-par.  For those kids into the idea of karate, the book will be much loved and read.  For others, however, the overly hokey writing will turn them away and they'll be far more interested in better books like "Bone".  A fine title but nothing to get worked up about 
 Unfortunately, this projector comes up very short for PowerPoint presentations because of the 800x600 resolution. As a result, the images are blurry and fuzzy. When I called Epson to explore this issue the rep said this was indeed a problem and results in the "screen door" effect.  If you intend to use this projector for PowerPoint presentations you need to get a projector with much better, at least 1024x768 or better resolution. Wish I had known that 
 I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.  It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.  My instincts would have been correct.  An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.  The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.  I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.  Though I will say I was amused by the last line 
 This is among the most disappointing Symantec products!!!  When one tries to log in to the infovault, the login box is often empty! There is no way to submit the information.  It is also impossible to get a straight answer from Customer Service. BRING BACK THE OLD PRODUCT, PLEASE!!!!  Have been a Norton customer for years....this one is just not great!! 
 I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go 
 Ehhh, well here goes... some of this is decent. I say that with a fair amount of self-consciousness since Staind isn't really taken that seriously these days - and rightfully so. But Dysfunction, for all its cliche nu metal-ness, has a unique gritty atmosphere and some decent tunes.  Early Staind is radio post-grunge crossed with a third rate Korn immitation, but it does have its charms. The guitarist borrows heavily from Korn's impressionistic chord-writing. Unlike a lot of radio bands these days, they didn't bury that strength (and the band's tone in general) under layers of sickeningly sweet production. In fact much of this record gets by on its sound rather than its songwriting. It seethes with frustration and the band have a good feel for each other.  I can't say Aaron Lewis's lyrics "seethe" with anything, unfortunately. They're mostly whiney mommy and daddy stories and his melodies aren't even that strong. This is another department in which Staind shamelessy robs their Korn forefathers blind. Lewis seems to have missed the point in Jonathan Davis's lyrics, seeing in his spit and bile an excuse to cry and moan. At the same time, the woe-is-me act does sort of add to the comedy of Staind in general.  It has some solid and catchy tunes, such as "Just Go", "Mudshovel" and "Home", and the rest is peppered with decent and occasionally inspired guitar riffs. The song structures are often haphazard and wander off track in uninteresting ways, but the vibe maintains throughout. It does what it does pretty well 
 I bought this book with the hope of understanding what my wife might be going through, so that she need not travel this road alone. I am a doctoral candidate in a medical facility and have had several publications in scientific journals as well as peer-reviewed numerous others. Reviewing material objectively is something I have done extensively. This book describes thought processes of people having mid-life issues and addresses only one solution as being viable; go YOUR own way, do YOUR own thing, YOU are right, YOU are the most important thing in the world. If this is all there is for Vickers-Willis to offer, no wonder her marriage failed! There is no room in any marriage for just the I and the ME; it is a partnership between the spouses and children. If the husband just did what he wants to, it would be considered selfish and self-centered, but Vickers-Willis seems to send the message (several illustrations) in her book that it would be "self-preservation" for women to do it. The second half of life can be as profound, meaningful and rich (as the author suggests it can) as the first or maybe even more, if husbands and wives are encouraged to find some common-ground to compromise on, that way the family continuity and memories are maintained, and just as importantly, each person's self-esteem. Walking away, and convincing yourself YOU are always right is just TOO easy; where are the other options? Put yourself in the other person's shoes! Sorry, this book is incomplete at best because it hasn't presented the picture of the forest, only several trees within it. How can one solve a problem without getting a big picture? The situation may have been defused but the problem was far from being solved. The 1 star is only for the effort put into the book.  
 This book promised to be a well-researched literary biography of J. D. Salinger. I was expecting details of his literary career, including how he went about writing, his dealings with publishers, and his reaction to public and critical response to his work. I only wanted to know the personal details of his life which had a direct bearing on his writing. Mr. Alexander succeeded fairly well in this effort, which is what comprises the first half of this book.  When Mr. Salinger stopped publishing, he became a private citizen. And as such, he deserves the privacy and respect we all desire. Of course, his books (especially Catcher In The Rye) elicited immense curiosity, and there will always be those socially inept and just plain psychotic folks who won't leave it alone. But a "respected" author/journalist such as Paul Alexander should certainly know better.  However, the opening chapter "A Sighting" and the entire last half of this book are the prurient and salacious work of a tabloid hack. "A Sighting" is a very creepy first-person step-by-step account of Mr. Alexander stalking the Salinger estate, and indeed Mr. Salinger himself. He admits to passing several "No Trespassing" signs, stopping, then "...I sat in my car and looked up at his house." Then finally "...I saw a car emerge from a thicket of trees...I focused my attention on the car's driver. I saw who it was- Salinger himself." Yekkkk! I found this account of stalking an old man to be extremely insulting, disrespectful, and repulsive.  The last half of the book is even more disgusting. Mr. Alexander feels that we all need to know in nauseating detail some of the most salacious and embarassing aspects Salinger's private life which occur long after he stopped publishing. None of this tripe is the slightest bit relevant to Salinger's writings, and is deeply insulting to Salinger and his readers. Alexander has the nerve to title one of the late chapters "Stalking Salinger" and to use phrases such as "assult on Salinger's privacy" as if he is being sympathetic to Salinger. What hypocricy! Mr. Alexander has displayed the morals of a salamander. I felt like I needed to take a shower when I finished this "masterpiece".  My advice- if you want to know the relevant facts of Salinger's literary life, find another book or go on the web. There are several informative and RESPECTFUL websites out there. Please don't give Mr. Alexander your money- it will only encourage him 
 I am like the last reviewer -  I wanted easy, chop it/dump it in and forget about it type of recipes.  At first glance in the bookstore it looked good and bought it.  I have been disappointed by this one - a lot of recipes have "weird" ingredients that a family with small kids just wouldn't eat or that I wouldn't have in my cupboards.  I keep looking for a "keeper" recipe and just can't find it.  Look at other slow cooker cookbooks - pass on this one 
 I didn't really like this one. In a way its worth reading as a coming out story and the writing was good enough to keep me reading. But the story...not so much. I found alot of the stuff that happened wierd at best and ridiculous at worst. And the end {bites}. I mean I got to the end and was like...um...ok...? I can't say I regretted reading it but at the same time its not something I need to remember. It jumps around alot, and it lacks valid plot points as far as I'm concerned. But I think its the kind of book you need to make up your own mind about 
 So, the elite of the entertainment industry are as debased and filled with hubris as the elite of any of America's industries, as well as its politicians.  So what? The only difference between Hollywood's freaks and the freaks of say, The Energy Industry, is that the Hollywood folks have thousands of photographers and reporters following them around 24/7. Why? because they are more interesting, more attractive and more colorful than the grey men and women of America's boardrooms.  Drugs, alcohol, gambling, pornography, prostitution, abuse, infidelity... these things are all epidemic across America.  The practice of and desire for these things result in multi-billion dollar industries. Who is spending all this money? Hollywood elites? No. It is all of America. Its your neighbors. Its you. The difference is, when your fat balding insurance adjuster neighbor orders up an escort, who cares? But when a movie star orders up a hooker, tabloids, and the "normal Americans" who breathlessly await the next juicy "scandal," can't wait to chronicle and publicize it infinitum.  Hollywood is America's Dream Maker and its Holy Distraction.  Not only does it produce the films, TV shows and music that we love to watch/hear for fun and relaxation, it also provides the scandals, gossip and (im)morality plays that the public just can't get enough of.  The only thing that Americans love more than watching their glamorous, larger than life celebrities live their fabulous lives is watching them falter and get torn down in public.  Its voyeurism, pure and simple. We love to watch them climb the ladder and we love even more to watch them fall off of it.   Rather than pointing the fingers at those "others" out in Hollywood, the authors of this screed, along with professional blamers and loudmouths like Bill O'Reilly, should instead take a look in the mirror.  After all, like it or not, the kinds of entertainment and entertainers that we choose is a reflection of who we collectively are as a culture.  If our chosen forms of distractions are "immoral" and created by "immoral people" perhaps its because the consumers (US!) are "immoral."  Or perhaps there's not much about it that's immoral at all. maybe its just human nature that a small percentage of finger-waggers and busybodies like to vilify for fun and profit.  Hollywood is the ultimate example of what the Free Market creates. Like it or not, this is what the American public wants.  When you go to the supermarket, you have about 5-7 brands of toothpaste you can choose. When you want to fill up at the pump you have to choose between 4-5 gasoline providers.  But when you turn on your TV, there are dozens of different shows that you can chose from at any given time. Don't like any of them? Wait a half hour, they'll be dozens more. Want to go to a movie, dozens out at any given time. Want to rent a DVD? Hundreds to choose from. Buy a CD? thousands available.  So, which is more a reflection of the REAL AMERICA? The 4-7 brands that we must chose from when we buy toothpaste and gas?  Or the hundreds to thousands of choices we have at any time when we want to spend some time relaxing with an entertainment product?  America, Hollywood is your funhouse mirror 
 This was outdated and simple before it was pubslished. You can read better info just glancing at some white papers for web analytic firms.  Even the person the author got to write a preface only suggested reading a few chapters - which you could read in no-time-at all.  
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 Many folks rate this above Maltin's m0vie guide. Why? It has an overall tone of snotty, over-intellectualized condescension that grates on the nerves. Plus, it delights in reviewing obscure, third-world flicks no-one's heard of, nor would want to see. It doesn't have a rating system, doesn't show availability in any format, doesn't show MPAA ratings, nor does it tell you where films are available for purchase or rent. In contrast, Maltin supplies all of these. Even if you don't always agree with his evaluations, in all, he provides much better info for decision-making 
 This is the absolute stupidest thing i have ever read.  The only amazing thing is how this author was ever able to publish it. This book is truly filled with mindless nonsense, for instance where to pass out after a drunken night, tips include the bathtub, in a dirty laundry basket, a hammock and under the dining room table..THANKS CAMERON TUTTLE, insert sarcasm.  
 This Russo collection of short stories didn't really work for me. I love his books like Straight Man and Nobody's Fool but I just couldn't get into this outing from him. It could very well not be Russo's fault, I tend to have issues with short stories in general 
 I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this 
 This book, while generally pretty complete, seems to have trouble explaining the concepts in anything other than formal definitions and the few "user friendly" explanations that is does give leave quite a bit to be desired.  This book would make a great reference for anyone already familiar with the concepts of computability but does little to accommodate readers that are new to the subject.  There are some pretty good step by step explanations of more basic subjects like non-deterministic finite automata but the explanations that are given for more complicated topics are very flaky.  Take the pumping lemma for example.  The book gives a very brief overview, a more formal definition, and then (prematurely) jumps into examples.  One key concept, "pumping length," is described simply as "a certain special value."  Its meaning is vaguely hinted at on the next page but is never actually stated - formally or in plain English 
 Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat. 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body 
 I thought this pillow would be the answer! Its a great idea but one insert is to flat, two inserts is ok, all three memory foam inserts are way to much. And pillow ear? Oh my aching ears, I have had pillow ear pain before but never like this. I am not sure my ears will ever be the same, and sadly, I probably have to stop using this pillow! It needs help : 
 I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.  The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.  Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
 please, editors, tell the new writer that a given plot must be cohesive.  A friend of Qwill's is killed in an accident, a friend who is the significant other of a fellow whom Qwill has known since he, the fellow, was a youngster, and Qwill does----NOTHING!!???  Get out of town!  Also, why was that hunting accident/murder thrown in?  Where did it go?  Nowhere!  Get the new author, or authors, up to speed 
 Disc Picture: As intended by the filmmakers, the stylized VC-1-encoded 1.85:1 HD DVD picture features differing color schemes depending on the location. The entire presentation is void of highly resolved fine details.  Soundtrack: The Dolby® Digital Plus 5.1-channel soundtrack is not overly exciting, although bass is delivered well through each of the channels, although the noise floor is low, dialogue and effects are generally well recorded, and the sound matches the storytelling nicely. 
 This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book 
 A good travelogue of the region. But only a few short minutes of the CANAL itself. Title is very misleading. Spends precious little time on the building of the canal, the experience of transversing it, et al. Focuses on the geography and culture of the cities in the area and the culture, etc. But very dispappointing regarding the CANAL itself 
 This is not a useful book for the eastern Backpacker, who has been carrying 55-60 lb. on the AT and wants to reduce his pack to a  20-25 lb. pack load, without going to the poor house in the process. The book lacks personality and feelings about why we backpack.  This is a highly analytical book on the technical aspects of Lightweight Backpacking in the west. Be less clinical and enjoy the experience a little more.This book is for those who mainly buy  at the high end and at a few select sources. It is also assumes that most backpackers live or pack near or west of the continental divide. It does not mention our many fine supply houses in the east, nor the different environments we encounter in the east 
 i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however 
 Losing weight is NOT as simple as Mr. Critser seems to believe, and his obvious disdain for the obese only takes away from his basic premise.  Although he goes to great lengths to show scientific studies and historic references, the underlying attitude of "obesity is the same as laziness and the culture is just promoting it" is apparent in the language.  Trust me, making someone feel bad about their weight is the worst way to make them get thin--or at least stay thin.  How about, instead of trying to shame people back into thinness (an impossible task, as it turns out), we try to shame McDonald's and Krispy Kreme into being more concerned for their consumers' welfare?  A better book on the subject would be Robert Pool's Fat: Fighting the Obesity Epidemic.  It contains many more conversations with doctors and scientists as well as people who have gained or lost a large amount of weight, putting a much better spotlight on science versus personal disgust 
 This book was a prescribed text that I had to buy when I was doing elementary histology. It had far too little information for that yet alone anything of greater depth.  The book is superficially thick, with hardly any proper organization it just seems pedantic and thats what it is, without any substance however.  For instance when it speaks of the liver it doesnt go into any detail about the lobulation of the liver; it draws allusions as to how the liver can replace the spleen in erythrocyte filtration but doesnt go into further depth.  It doesnt tabulate (as most texts should and do) the comparative contractile mechanisms of the three muscle types.  Nor does it go into any proper depth on the ramifications of purkenje fibers to the contraction of cardiac muscle or how it differs from skeletal contraction.  It fails to recognize and mention characteristic landmarks on histological tissue i.e. Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus which is a dead give away to a failing histological text.  It wastes a lot of paper with chapter after chapter references, I mean you dont buy a textbook to just get more references to other texts, its not a directory that we are looking for now are we.  The chapter on the lymphatics and smooth muscle contraction are two things that I would accredit this book for having a done a good job on.  There are several other histology texts that you should consider prior to this, please do yourself a favour and DONT get this book. 
 I bought this book thinking I might learn something new.  It is expensive for a paperback, but its 280-odd pages are in a very large typeface, so its cover leads you to expect more to read than there is.  There are numerous anecdotes from people who had struggled with diagnosis of this disease - are doctors really so incompetent?  Unfortunately, I did not find many of these to be helpful.  The book covers quite a lot of treatment possibilities, many of which are not much use, or not available at present anyway.  I did not learn anything new from the book, in spite of my hopes from reading other reviews.  I had learned from excellent web sites (neuropathy-trust.org) and other books, and as a patient not afraid to ask questions of my doctors, nor intimidated by them, I found that the book did not give me any new knowledge.  It is markedly unhelpful with practical solutions - shoes, socks, etc., that are important for day to day living.  A big disappointment after the other rave reviews 
 This book wasn't quite what I expected when it arrived, but I kept it anyway since I am a Korean Studies major and can probably use it in the future.  It is somewhat "technical and scholarly" and I wouldn't recommend it for the casual reader.  If you're seriously into studying about Korea this might be an OK book 
 This book is very basic and very very standard stuff it makes me wish I could go back and change my review of Paul Vunaks "Anatomy of a Streetfight" and give him a higher score because he puts alot more useful info in his book. I really wasn't impressed by this book you would be better off buying Paul Vunak's book or even Diallo Frazier's "Revelations of a Warrior 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 If you're a trusting sort, read the title of this review and stop--don't spend another moment thinking about this film. But if you must know why you should not waste 95 minutes of your life on it, as I did, read on.  Garcon Stupide has delusions of grandeur, as does its main character, a young gay lad who seeks his thrills in anonymous sexual encounters and believes he's a good photographer because he takes pictures with the built-in camera of his cellular phone.  Said lad (Loic, played by first-timer Philippe Chatagny) is pretty enough to warrant the numerous extended closeups of his face that comprise half the film--the picture on the box does not do his enchanting smile justice--but the pablum he speaks is by turns silly, nonsensical, and stupid. The plot, such as it is, takes its cue from the dialogue, and in the end it feels like a series of utterly random events have carried us to an implausible conclusion.  What ought to make the film at least a little bit palatable for a gay audience--the gritty sex in which Loic engages quite freely during the film's first half--is filmed inelegantly and, in one uninspired split-screen scene, juxtaposed with the workings of factory machinery. This is an odd place for the director to make a play at realism in a tale otherwise so unconstrained by it!  If you're looking for a good gay coming-of-age story, try Dorian Blues. You may not get to see the main character naked, but at least you'll respect yourself in the morning 
 Dolph Lundgren stars as a Mercenary sent to kill a Tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation,Dull and just plain pointless (And Stupid) action film suffers from Inept Action scenes and logic lapses. Lundgren is Imposing but can't act 
 The only reason I rated this two stars was because my bird could care less about this CD.  I originally was online with some bird websites.  I have a cockatiel and she is so whiney (squawking - screaming) when you leave the room.  One of the reviewers said this CD did the trick for his bird.  Well I think I have a special needs bird :) The CD itself is soothing for me.  However, it doesn't do anything to quiet my needy cockatiel 
 If you liked the movie Syriana, you won't like the book or the poorly written autobiography by Robert Baer.  It's a rehash of 9/11 failures ...there is nothing new here, not even a good description of CIA tradecraft. The close is typical:  "Are we not hitting the target we can rather than the target we should 
 This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not  worth taking the time to point them out 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that 
 The lonely planet london had some good walking tours, but for the most part, terribly out-dated in terms of prices for museums/attractions and also many stores/restaurants/internet spots have since closed.  The maps are decent 
 I bought this book, thinking that it would offer some insight into Amazon.com in terms of what it was like to work there during its halcyon days.  Touted as a funny memoir, among other things, I was to discover that it was none of what was promised. In fact, the book was painfully difficult to read, as it was very poorly written, decidedly not funny, and offered little insight into what it really was like to work at Amazon. It was totally sophomoric in terms of what it did say.   The author should be thankful that he was not fired by Amazon, as that is what he richly deserved to have happen based upon his own account of what he was like as an employee. He was a total  slacker who treated customers with the contempt that he felt that they deserved. He was totally wasteful of the company's resources. He proudly stole supplies in bulk from the company. When toys were given to him for review purposes, he not only did not bother to review them, he then refused to return the toys to Amazon. He may think that all this is hilarious. Unfortunately, I do not. Reading this drivel felt like it took twenty-one dog years.   Moreover, this book was so poorly written, I am surprised that a reputable publisher went ahead with the expense of actually publishing it. I guess that the name Amazon carries a great deal of weight for which the author should be eternally grateful. I doubt that had he written a book titled, "21 Dog Years: Doing time @ Sears.Com", substituting Sears for Amazon, that he would have found a publisher. Don't waste your time with this drivel. If you want to read a well-written, interesting book about working at Amazon, read "Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot. Com Juggernaut" by James Marcus 
 This book could be useful for a serious etymologyst, but it is very difficult to decifer unless you are willing to spend hours learning all of the abbreviations. It is organized like a dictionary.  The entries give the current dictionary definition of each word, and then proceed to trace the evolution of the word.  This evolution is often difficult to understand because of the previously mentioned abbreviations.  This book is for a dedicated linguist, or someone with much patience and tim 
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 I had to read this book for class.  It wasn't that good.  Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what.  It might be a small book but its tedious reading.  I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters.  I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem.  Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens 
 ... and the maps are worthless.    Two examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book: 1) Rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk.  The following is an actual transcript of our conversation with the tourist info lady: us: buon giorno.  do you speak english? info lady: of course. us: we'd like to go to Vatican city.  may we have a bus map please? info lady: a bus map? for Roma? us: um, yes. info lady: no such thing exists.  2) Rick claims you can see everything you want to see in the Vatican in one morning: St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel - everything. Um, Rick? Have you ever BEEN there? Did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things? Did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface?  Did it occur to you that people might, perhaps, want to stop and admire a large number of them? Light a candle? Say a prayer? Some of us, also, have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly Germans to look at Michaelangelo's Pieta, and everything else.  Methinks ol' Rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in Rome, or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs 
 This book should be used as firewood not to entertain or educate kids.  How did the author get it published 
 This book could have been ONE chapter, but I guess that's hard to sell! I have no idea why this has such a high rating. It's repetitive, internally inconsistent, and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving. If you want a hopelessly out-of-date book about a CEO patting himself on the back, go for it. Bonus- tons of boring anecdotes! (Gotta fill up the pages somehow! 
 Have you ever heard the saying, "there is no free lunch"?  This book can be lumped into that category.  I wasn't surprised to see that most of her positive reviewers had her advertisement on their website.  PLEASE AVOID! Assumption are outrageous. The entire strategy of the book is to screw with your mind.  Example - Invest your money in a S.A.F.E.T.Y. Fund getting a conservative 8%. (It stands for Side Account Faithfully Earning Tax-favored Yields) It doesn't exist!!    
 I can't remember if Doctor Wallach is mentioned in his book or not but the other day I came across this man's site, promoting his book. He had a listing there about Doctor Joel Wallach. Within the first sentence he said that Wallach claims that all diseases are a result of mineral deficiency! Amazing...this is how he calls Wallach a quack? With a complete and total LIE. That's right. See I have Wallach's books. My family takes his supplements. I am part of Wallach's company email: Ekowal459@aol.com to discuss it further if you're inclined, etc. Now, I have also listened to DOCTOR Wallach's seminars in about 20 different variations and have health successes of my own as a result of him. Never once does Dr. Wallach [BS,DVM+ND] or his Wife Dr. Ma Lan [A Microsurgeon MD with a Masters in Science and liscensed Acupuncturist], ever come within the neighborhood of saying that all diseases are caused by mineral deficiency! This is insane and completely untrue. Furthermore he discredits Wallach for calling himself a physician by the implication that a Naturopathic doctor is NOT a physician on the grounds that he is NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. Once again a moron who can't understand how someone who's primary means of health care for patients is not pharmaceuticals can be a legitimate Doctor. So by his standards Osteopaths are not Physicians? No one can heal anyone else unless they dispence pharmaceuticals? Oh that's right, Naturopaths can dispense pharmaceuticals in state's which allow it...like the one Wallach trained and worked in...interesting. And Wallach does recommend some pharmaceuticals where prudent...he's not a lunatic. He talks about what an outrage his claims are? Such an outrage... I have one of his seminars on tape where he is speaking to 200 DOCTORS. Why would they even show up? This man tries to discredit Doctor Wallach and that which he says which aren't lies are just foolish arguments that make him look like the con artist or just plain ignorant of his subject [Wallach, Naturopathy, Health...etc. Don't waste your time on this man's books. I won't even talk about the positive points in this book that actually have merit because as far as I'm concerned his ranting about Doc Wallach on his site... and in the book, I seem to recall, discredits everything else period.

 David Shenk's new book, "The Immortal Game" is a nostalgic journey through the history of chess and indeed, the influence of chess on history. In the context of searching his own chess past, Shenk provides a rich collection of chess facts and anecdotes. This is all tied together as the author reviews the remarkable chess game between Anderssen and Kierseritzky.  The book does present some interesting material. However, I cannot recommend the book. The book was just too simplistic and geared for an audience that has only limited exposure to chess. For comparison, try "Searching For Bobby Fischer" by Fred Waitzkin 
 I ordered these hot rollers based on previous reviews and was sorely disappointed!   The rollers are extremely hot and have to cool before they can be handled.  Plus, they are sooo heavy, it's hard to keep them in the hair.  These are without a doubt the worst rollers I've ever owned.  Would not recommend them to anyone 
 I have watched a lot of horror movies in my lifetime.  There are some great and original films in this genre, and there are some that are just plain terrible. This movie definitely falls into the 'terrible' category. I don't remember watching the first of the sequel. I didn't pay to watch this movie, and it was like watching a vhs tape so i fast forwarded through a lot of it cuz i figured i'd just 'waste' less time.  I can't believe Bruce Springsteen's sister acts in this. He must be humiliated by it as she can't act!  The acting overall, as in many of the camper type horror movies, is horrendous!  Got 90 minutes to "waste"? Like stupid horror movies with really bad acting? Then by all means, watch this stinker.   However, Angela(the killer and The Boss's sis) certainly found some very interesting and original ways to kill people.  Also, the scene where she is fishing and pulls up a hockey mask is sort of funny, as I'm sure it was meant to be.  It seemed fitting and almost makes this film look like more of a spoof of the genre as opposed to an actual scary movie. The acting is terrible, all the characters are morons, but wait there's more! If you like nudity, you will at least get to see some half naked women.   I am still willing to give the first 'sleepaway camp' a viewing after hearing that it's a good horror movie 
 If you want to spend 4 times as much money, 8 times as much time, and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately "politely refuse"--THEN BUY THIS BOOK! The author clearly has NO CLUE that "less is often more. 
 I am quite dissappointed in this CD, being won over by the sound bytes that I sampled here at Amazon, which are very beautiful. Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.  Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.  I will be looking at selling my CD so I can recoup at least a portion of my investment 
 I was so offended with this book. I agree with Bruce in regards to the conservatives and how they shape our image. But to put blame on the activist and the more eccentric gay people is just ridiculous.  I was both an activist and eccentric and let me tell you I fought for my rights every day of my life.  I am proud of this struggle because I never compromised myself to fit in and appear normal....and I know my example has played a small part in changing this world for the better.  Those so called mainstream and normal gays are enjoying life because of people like me.  We fought the fight while they sat back and pasted judgment...how dare they.  The reason the activist and eccentric gays appear to shape the gay image is because they are the brave souls! If you want the world to know that we all aren't that way then get your normal, mainstream ass out of the closet and do your part.....how can you expect the people to know that not every one gay is eccentric and an activist if you guys are always hiding behind closed doors in fear. In my opinion you normal wannabees are the real threat to gay freedom 
 Referring to "nice white people" as demons who are just trying to hold the "black man" down is not an answer to racism. Akil is a hypocrite because he is just as racist as the people he is accusing of being racist. Stereotyping all white people as being oppressive to other races because white people don't want to see African Americans succeed is ludicrous. Akil writes with hatred towards white people and blames white people for all of his shortcomings. His message is a horrible one to expose to young, influential adolescents because he is passing on a message of hate. He gives the impression that a black person not accomplishing his/her goals occurs only because white people will not allow black people to succeed. Maybe he should try passing along the message that people need to be responsible for their actions, and any person that genuinely strives to accomplish a goal can accomplish it.  Also, he writes on the back cover of his book that learning to read challenging material, such as work by Shakespeare, is a waste of time. This is the exact opposite of what he claims his goal is. Educating young people of all races is an equalizer. If Akil had studied more Shakespeare, then maybe his book wouldn't be riddled with grammatical errors. 
 I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL??? 
 The plot to this story was extremely boring with a very weak mystery.  The characters were unbelievable and not very likable.  Was difficult to even finsh the book 
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 if you want to see a movie of equal quality turn on usa or tnt. the plot is about a women (nak) who wont let go...of her life. she dies during labor and her ghost convinces her husband (mak) that she is fine. and the rest is to rediculous to tell youthe two stars are for the filming (a few parts have there moments), the lighting, and a few scenes with a buddhist monk toward the end that were enjoyable.over not worth buying -  asian cinema has so much to offer... but this is not one of the 
 I sought history, facts, etc.  However, this book is written with such female-type hysteria that getting beyond the first chapter is a chore.  I am extremely disappointed.  The author obviously picked apart her research to slant the information with little or no care for common knowledge that disputes her claims.  Trash.  A definite loss of money here 
 "Red Water," a made for television film starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Kristy Swanson, carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off "Jaws." You would think that nearly thirty years after Steven Spielberg's project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre. You would be wrong. Every year brings us even more "animal gone wild" flicks, everything from sharks, octopi, whales, snakes, bears, rats, ants, birds, cats, dogs, dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans. If the creature in question has sharp teeth, claws, wings, talons, tentacles, and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget, straight to video knockoff of "Jaws." Sure, there are elaborations to the standard plot lines, none of which significantly improves these rip-offs, but all of them owe a big debt to Steven Spielberg's film. For example, "Red Water" tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a Louisiana River. It also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed. None of these ideas disguises what is really going on.  "Red Water" is the story of John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips), a down on his luck fisherman with an ex-wife, horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician, and loans on his boat he can't afford to repay. At the same time Sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments, a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers, fishermen, and anyone else who manages to get in the way. Sanders could care less about the shark, primarily because he doesn't know about it at first and also because his ex-wife Kelli (Kristy Swanson) just walked back into his life. She's a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river, and she knows that John is an expert on this sort of thing. Whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name "Kelli" is another matter. Sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles. After all, he'll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat. What none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks, one that swims and several that walk around on two legs.  The movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some Jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities. This guy hires some mercenary thug, along with a goon named Ice (Coolio), to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash. And wouldn't you know it? The site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where Sanders and Kelli eventually show up! What follows is incredibly predictable: the criminals take over Sanders's vessel because they think these guys angling for the money, a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers, and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals. How predictable is "Red Water"? Not only is there a Cajun chap helping out on Sanders's boat, we get a few scenes of a Cajun party complete with music and dancing. Just in case you aren't aware that you should laugh at these hicks, the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to "Deliverance." How clever and original is that? I'm starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows. If you put any minority group in the place of these Cajuns and did the same thing, the outcry would be deafening.  It's not the overt prejudice of the Cajun scenes that sinks "Red Water"; it's everything else. The venerable Lou Diamond Phillips hasn't made a good film since...well...I can't recall, actually. I quit following his career after "The First Power." As for Kristy Swanson, I was surprised to see her here. I remember her star rising in the early to mid 1990s, but at some point she fell off the radar and, if "Red Water" is any indication, into B-movie purgatory. It's sad, really, because she's not that bad of an actress. Coolio, on the other hand, goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money. If I had known from the start that this guy was in the film, I wouldn't have watched it. Aside from the performances, or the lack thereof, the production values are low, the pace drags, and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters' mouths. I really, really wish I had written down some of the odd lines uttered by Phillips's character. I remember watching the movie and thinking at the time, "I should write that down and use it later in a review." For some reason, I didn't. Probably because I just wanted this thing to end quickly.  In another bizarre turn, the movie carries a 'R' rating even though there isn't much bloody carnage going on. The only extras on the disc, fortunately, are trailers for "Bats," "The Big Hit," and "Ride or Die." If you're really interested in watching creatures attack flicks, there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from, most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level. "Red Water" is too bland, too confused plot wise, and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining. If you decide to head up this river, good luck to you.       
 I am a professional pet stylist, and when I saw this book advertised in one of the Groomer magazines, I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it.  I was excited to see that someone had actually written a book addressing the issues of grooming "mixed" breeds, a.k.a. Mutts.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.  This book provides no real information.  The author uses drawings of dogs she has groomed in the past.  These drawings are only a 'side' view, and no drawing of the all important head is included.  I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 only because the author, at least, attempted to write a book about mutts.  The author simply suggests that you, as a groomer, determine what pure breeds the mutt resembles, and then groom accordingly.  I can tell you that in my shop, I see many mutts that are impossible to determine their lineage.  I was hoping this book detailed the different requirements of grooming a mutt, such as providing details of creating a "Teddy Bear" head on a Shih Tzu, or how to set up a "mane" when doing a strip on an Alaskan Husky.  The book is short on details, and actually gave me NO new information or tips that are not readily available in any one of dozens of pure bred grooming books.  I cannot recommend this book to professional groomers as there is no detail and the drawings are sadly lacking.  I certainly would not recommend this book to the grooming "do-it-yourselfer" as there is no information concerning the basics of grooming such as proper bathing and brushing, etc.  Don't experience the buyers remorse I am experiencing.  I absolutely do NOT RECOMMEND buying this book 
 I listened to this tape, hoping to get something new out of it. What I really got was annoyed. The frequent proselytizing about Act! was at once a major turn off and a distraction. If you have never read anything about time management then you may find something useful in the most basic sense. I, however, did not find anything new. Better choices would be "Getting Things Done" by David Allen and "Eat that Frog" by Brian Tracy 
 When it comes to Anne Rice, I started not with Interview with the Vampire but with Servant of the Bones.  That one was okay, so I decided to read The Witching Hour.  What a freakin' mistake.  It's clear to me that Anne Rice, through her writing, is saying to her readers "Look at me! I'm so impressed with myself!"  (It's also clear given her recent 'review' on Amazon of one of her own novels.)  The story of the Witching Hour actually started off somewhat decently.  I was able to turn my head the other way during the poorly written sex scenes--scenes that were very similar to a scene in Servant of the Bones--and the rushed, badly handled romance; but once the story turned into the Mayfield history, it began to fall apart.  This is unfortunate, given that this is the last third of the book or so.  The end of the book felt cobbled together, rushed and unfinished, even for a book that is part of a series.  I literally threw the book across the room when I finished, mad that I'd invested enough time to read a thousand-page book and be disappointed by the end.  Worst of all, though, is that the story seems to be more adolescent self-serving fantasy than anything I'd really want to read.  I've grown up since reading this book and I've moved on to better authors.  If you don't read Anne Rice, I'd advise skipping her altogether.  Once you get past the first few books of the Vampire Chronicles, you will outgrow her writing 
 This toaster is more a decoration than anything else. My kids eat a lot of bagels & frozen waffles, and this machine just doesn't do the job without multiple toasting cycles. Even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle. I also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place, break off. (How?? it just sits on the counter, no one is playing football with it!) I feel that I wasted $50.00 on this- save your money 
 This book is a great example of the problem with the contemporary left: a paralysis by analysis by academics too comfortable in their lofty ivory tower to actually take any political action. There was a time when left intellectuals were more concerned class struggle than making tenure or getting published in the most trendy post-modern theory journal. Try to imagine the look on the face of any working class Joe sipping beer at a sports bar when confronted with the language this book is couched in. Ivory tower Marxist serve as an "outlet" for revolutionary energy in a capitalist society. The ivory tower radicalism espoused by this book is nothing but another system of control. 
 This is not the health magazine you'd expect from Martha Stewart -- it's extremely heavy on advertisements (45% at my rough count), and really cluttered, and just not "good". The recipes are interesting,  if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I found that this book is not worth the money I spent for it. It is more like a magazine than  a book. There are only 100 pages, (three of which are advertisements) and most of them are filled with old photographs with no explanations. The photos are classified in 5 year intervals and no detailed reasons given for why these photos are in those intervals. There is only 5 pages of text eplaining how to date these photographs and about half the text is used to give you a brief and very general history of early photography. The book, if that is what you want to call it, does not do a fair or even adequate job of helping a collector date old photographs. 
 I am a big fan of the Missing Manual series. Previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. I therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. Office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that Microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities.  However, the book is a major disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor organization. Most of the mistakes are ones you can work around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes A and B are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction. Every few pages I find myself going to the Missing Manuals web site to report yet more errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible writing, seeming confusion between the Mac and PC versions of the program, etc. And I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index.  It looks as though O'Reilly Publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book, but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. That is too bad, because I will now be much more hesitant to purchase another Missing Manuals title 
 I was expecting more out of a plot that was set in the sleazy world of strippers and prostitution but this book was so superficial in its usage of this plot device that it would have been better to have chosen something different. The two protagonists are also not well-drawn though the heroine fared better than Hank, the hero. All throughout the book, he came across as boring and conservative - which did not gel with the author's description of him as an ex-Ranger AND a psychic. I mean, wow - as an ex-Ranger, Hank would have some back story but nothing is said about him. I didn't know what he was like, what events in his life shaped him into the man he is today, who his friends were and what drives him;  His whole character is made up of a guy who operates a martial arts school after being an ex-Ranger. He was like an inanimate object in the book at worst and at best, a Labrador seeing-eye dog. At least Jess had some emotional aspect to her but not much either. The annoying thing is that both the plot and the characters had so much potential.  For a much more satisfying police procedural, Karen Rose is much better bet because you'll get great romance and great characterisation. I haveLisle's I See You but after LGD, I did not feel like another Lisle 
 This book had a good message, and could have had a lasting impact on me. But the plot was obscenely dull, and the middle of the book (Gene and Finny relationship) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Not recommended 
 I know it's very unfair to judge a group by a "best of" hits compilation, but this is all of I've heard of the group -- and all I want to hear. There are a couple of good tracks but the rest wanders between the boring and the quite dreadful. Listening to the singer trying to stay in tune during the final song -- Wait for the Sun -- is truly painful, rather like watching a drunk at night reaching out in a bid to catch the moon. There's nothing I've heard here which would even remotely make me want to buy any of this group's albums. Sorry, but there it is. My taste in weird and off-beat bands tends more to "They Might Be Giants", a duo which indeed makes Supergrass look litle more than musical pygmies. Listening more closely to this CD, I detect pretty blatant undertones from bands such as Fischer Z and Steve Harley and the Cockney Rebels 
 Tired themes and characterizations plague this book and the quality of writing suffers (lack of complexity and depth). I wish Christian publishers held to higher standards for their authors. The reading level is only about 6th or 7th grade level. Hey, if you're looking for a readable novel for your preteen this might be a good one.  It *is* interesting, I just want more than pablum - I would love to see excellence.  Try "Arena" by Karen Hancock - it's closer to the mark 
 For all of Prof Spence's scholarly research - I got a better understanding of the Taiping from Flashman and the Dragon 
 the cd dosent work!!!!.I spent hours trying to do the first session but it just doesnt happen.The cd is useless you cant down load files,go vegas 4. 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better 
 Love Leonard Cohen, but this particular item disappointed us immensely 
 For a book with such an empowering title for women, it sure doesn't give them much credit. This book stresses the message that a woman's only calling is to produce children and support her husband relentlessly. Wilson seems very frightened of what might happen if she so much as disrespects her husband once or isn't there for him enough. For example, she advises treating your body like your husband's garden so he may enjoy it whenever he pleases and always having your breasts available to him because he might be tempted by another woman's breasts (this gave me a humorous image of a woman thrusting her chest in her husband's face when he glances at another woman). There seems to be a note of fear in these words, as though Wilson truly feels a husband will stray if he's not constantly reminded that he can have sex with his wife. If Wilson's so concerned about disrespecting men, maybe she should consider how disrespectful that presumption of male lust sounds. This book has such a negative view of women that it harps on and on about how we need men to take care of us because we apparently can't take care of ourselves. Both sexes are portrayed badly here; if I couldn't take care of myself, I certainly wouldn't want to be in the care of a man who needed a constant view of my breasts to keep from straying! The book is full of offensive remarks about marriage, particularly the claim that it's not a partnership. What does two becoming one mean, if not a partnership and a joining together? The book also preaches that the husband is head of the wife, though the usage of the word here is different than the Biblical one. Constant comments such as, "you must always refer to your head; your head has the final say" imply that Wilson believes women, upon marriage, should give up use of their brains and place their husband's heads literally on their own shoulders. This goes far beyond loving and respecting a husband in a Godly way. I cannot see how people can embrace this book, but I'm going to caution women to stay away from it; try Liz Curtis Higgs instead. One final note of interest: inspite of Wilson's many different suggestions of how to sexually please your husband (because he might get bored if you stick to one way), her own husband, in his book for men, says quite plainly that he believes sex is a duty and doesn't need spark in order to be pleasing. I wonder if his wife knows this?... 
 The Ramones meet AC/DC. A live record with the song covered by Pearl Jam. Not a great recording. The songs are good, would rather hear studio versions. If you are looking to buy cause of the Pearl Jam song.. don't waste your money. Otherwise they are a good band but the production is no good 
 After user #1 I was REALLY impressed.  My teeth were noticeably whiter--almost gleaming.  After use number two I noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic.  On use # 3 I felt some discomfort after putting the trays in.  After about 1/2 hour it was really starting to hurt and I thought something must be wrong so I took them out.  My gums were bleached white!  I was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1/2 an hour.  However, there was some lingering damage done that, while not severe, is annoying (there is still a slight bit of bleeding).  I have perfectly healthy gums so I was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums.  My advice, if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out 
 Others have written many of the same words I would have used so I will be brief. I grabbed this book based on a mention from John Grogan in the Marley book. Katz is not nearly as pure of a dog owner. He seems to take pleasure in recounting his practiced dominance over his dogs. He claims to adore them but uses force and physical punishment while explaining how lucky they are to have him. In my mind, the dogs seem like experiments. This book is more about Katz than it is about the dogs. A lot of ego on display. I didn't come away with warm regard for the author. 
 As it was stated by another reviewer, the Criterion transfer of "Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne" is quite disappointing. The film seems loose in the gate and therefore the picture is very instable; it's jumping a lot, which is very irritating. Also, there is some noise present in the background. So although Criterion did clean up the print quite much, this effort is in vain due to the imperfect transfer. I wonder why nobody has noticed this at Criterion? And its a problem which could have been corrected quite easily....  Considering the high price Criterion asks for this title: don't buy it 
 I installed Adobe 8.0 at the request of a client in order to view secure docments on-line.  Two serious problems were caused by this: 1) Window 2000 Outlook runing under XP would crash after the Adobe reader was launched. Closing the reader and restarting Outlook would not always fix the problem. Often the computer would require a cold re-boot.  2). More serious, Adobe 8 installation corrupted my Agilent Technologies Genesys 8 and later (Eagleware) RF simulation software tools.  This resulted in the Genesys simulator to fail to find the authentication file.  Because the correlation between installing Adobe was not apparent considerable amount of time was lost on this project.  Adobe also causes problems with OrCAD 15 license server.  I have currently un-installed Adobe 8 had to re-install and patch previously installed Microsoft and enginnering software tools. 
 Sudhir Venkatesh's 'American Project' has certain strengths. For one thing, it gives an informative overview of the general conditions within the Robert Taylor Homes and how they declined between the 1960s and 1990s. For example, there are extensive quotations of Taylor's tenants, which illustrate first-hand experiences of getting along day by day and coping with deteriorating physical and social conditions. The author is able to use his field work in Chicago to bring his readers inside the housing project to a certain extent. Secondly, the book's chapter divisions are convenient for dividing the Taylor Homes' history by decade.    However, 'American Project' also has numerous weakesses.     First, there are no photos or other visuals in the entire book, making it difficult to picture the vastness of the project and what an average apartment or lobby looked like.    Second, like many sociologists, the author paints the residents of the Taylor Homes as perpetual victims of a vicious, evil, forever racist world that is responsible for all their poor living conditions. For example, in describing why some gang members decided to remain in gangs instead of working in mainstream jobs, listed among the reasons are 'white privilege that denies blacks job-promotion and career opportunities.' The author does not consider affirmative action and other programs that are designed exactly for the purpose of giving blacks and other minorities job opportunities. He also seems ignorant of the fact that during the 1980s, the unemployment rate for black teenagers fell by 21%, the number of black families earning over $50,000 per year increased from 7% to 14%, and black employment in professional and managerial occupations increased 33% (Dept. of Labor Statistics). How can blacks possibly have been systematically denied career opportunities during the 1980s given these figures? Venkatesh also writes that 'youth in this community ... have been discarded by mainstream social institutions.' Yet in these same pages he describes residents who have managed to attain college degrees and even get decent jobs working in downtown Chicago.  How, then, have they been 'discarded'?    Third, the author takes a big hammer and tries to smash Ronald Reagan to pieces. The author lost lots of credibility with me on page 149 when he compares Reagan to the character played by Michael Douglas in Oliver Stone's movie 'Wall Street.' He portrays Reagan as a money-grabbing, heartless man who wrings his hands and chortles 'Greed is good'  as the poor suffer.  Contrary to popular belief, this simply isn't true.   Not only this, but the author flat out lies by stating that 'Reagan ... [refused] to direct government money to the poor and needy' (p. 149) He cites statistics that imply that the Reagan administration said 'screw the poor.' However, Venkatesh's statistics are completely misleading. According to the Congressional Budget Office ('Federal Housing Assistance and its Distribution,' Chapter 3, www.cbo.gov), national housing project OUTLAYS, which are the amounts of money actually spent on federally subsidized housing, increased steadily all through the 1980s, from $8 billion in 1981 to $16 billion in 1987 (even hitting $28 billion in 1985). Reagan is a favorite target for many people in the 'it's-always-society's-fault' crowd, yet these people themselves rarely know what they're talking about.   In short, 'American Project' seems to be a decent overview of life in a major housing project, but the trite victimization and anti-Reagan ramblings, typical of the academic Left, wear very thin 
 As time goes by, I have less and less respect for anything Milton Friedman has to say.  We should all remember that Enron is the desired Republican result of Friedman's "Structured Finance" - what others would call Organized Crime-style bust-outs and other scams. And we should all remember that the freedom to choose among consumer goods is NOT something the Founders considered important enough to enshrine in the Bill of Rights.  It is also important to note, as does Barry Schwartz, in his "The Paradox of Choice", that "constantly being asked to make choices, even about the simplest things, forces us to 'invest time, energy, and no small amount of self-doubt, and dread.' There comes a point, he contends, at which choice becomes debilitating rather than liberating. Did I make the right choice? Can I ever make the right choice?"  We normally assume in America that more options ("easy fit" or "relaxed fit"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well-being.  Many of Friedman's "suggestions for reform" are GOP platform line-items that serve the hidden agenda of gutting America's national security interests. This is especially true of his "school voucher" program that will deprive America the Nation of millions of intelligent citizens of the Republic who are qualified to vote based on an understanding of national issues that goes beyond the superficial jingoism doled out at "voucher schools", which are, in reality, nothing more than the segregation academies of the Massive Resisters.  So, as globalization (i.e. transnational corporatism) subsumes democracy, it becomes clear that Friedman is more of an apologist for profiteers and criminals than a major economic thinker 
 I had to take a look at this book just like I did Rachel Shteir's previous book "Striptease" to see if the online reviews were true. Sadly, they were. Like "Striptease", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter. Gypsy Rose, I guess we both made the same mistake: trusting someone like Ms. Shteit to help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to pull it off 
 I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a "20 inch" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!  
 Wow was this bad.  I was so hoping to like it as I love some of these characters so much (especially Rachel Summers!).  Unfortunately, these characters act out of character throughtout and ignore past history and relationships.  The X-Men run around like chickens with their heads cut off from battle to battle spouting the same Claremont cliches that they've spouted 100 times before.  If you really want to read the legendary Chris Claremont, track down the reprints of X-Men #94 - 200; unfortunately, not even the gorgeous Alan Davis art makes this book readable 
 I work on a helpdesk where our employer purchased a set of CS10s (along with a set of older-style lifters for which I cannot find a model number) to allow us to move freely about the office while taking support calls. While generally very functional, they exhibit a few *very* severe problems. We have gone through a total of nine of them without resolving these issues:    The units will, seemingly at random, produce incredibly loud feedback to both sides of the connection. This seems to be related to the phono jack on the remote unit, but also depends on physical location (some areas experience this more frequently than others; so far, air conditioning seems a likely cause).    The units will periodically bleed across channels. Changing channel on the remote unit or range on the base unit does not affect this -- you will be treated to static and the combined calls of all other units in the area, typically until you replace the remote unit (although the remote units appear to correct themselves after time).    They also exhibit frustratingly poor lifter response (even after replacing our older lifters with HL10s). This appears to be a duplexing problem; when placing an outgoing call, the lifter responds fine, but if a call is being received, then the signal used to ring the remote unit (even if ringing is turned off) appears to block the lift signal, not only failing to answer the call but also preventing you from using the Talk button for 5-10 seconds afterward. When this happens multiple times in a row, it becomes entirely impossible to answer the phone at all.    I am very surprised to read so many favorable reviews. After having replaced every single unit at least once, we still find them to be barely adequate for our operations. I do not believe that we have received defective units every single time, nor that our environment is unusual in how we use them. I recommend all potential buyers approach this product with caution 
 Pat Califa wrote, "Our culture insists on sexual uniformity and does not acknowledge any neutral difference only crimes, sins, disease and mistakes."    Such we see represented in Dr. Amen's book.  Dr. Amen makes reference to what he considers normal sexually in his book.  Like so many clinicians and diastognicians his normality is of a vanilla world.  Anything outside of that is referred to as an imbalance in the brain or a disorder.  My own research has been focused on debunking the myths about sexuality that are perpetuated in this book.  The chapter on addictions and fetishes lacks any creative thinking whatsoever.  Unfortunately I returned the book to the bookstore due to the limited thinking represented here.    Sincerely, Ilona Paris, LMHC  
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 I thought I might be able to recapture some of the original pleasure of watching the Cavett shows, but I was terribly wrong. In contrast to the wit he seemed when I was a kid, he now seems like a witless dolt. His jokes are not funny, his questions not perceptive, and he constantly steps all over his guests' attempts to utter pointless gibberish. The DVD notes make a fool out of Sly Stone, and I expected the worst, but compared to the rest of the numbskulls, and to Cavett himself, Sly comes off rather sensibly. It's hardly necessary to ridicule Sly for drug use when Cavett has raved about the wonderful effects of his own electroshock treatments. Interviews of semi-literate musicians by a shallow, self-obsessed host do not make for pleasurable viewing 
 Some of the characters and story lines are interesting in and of themselves.  However, the story line doesn't progress.  Who cares about angels?  Not me.  I'm sorry my book group selected this story.  My suggestion--read something else that truly develops characters and plot 
 As some have noted, Dead Solid Perfect was a dead solid hit among golfers and has been the standard by which other golf novels are judged. Unfortunately, the author who created the standard has failed to measure up to it. The story is mildly entertaining, but just not up to what we have come to expect from this writer. Having recently read The Green and A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe, I am aware of how good a novel can be woven about this enchanitng and maddening game. This isn't one of them 
 I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend.  I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people.  When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility.  Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover.  Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.  In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided.  
 Definitly not worth the money. I thought it was poorly written and really did not have any new informatin in it that was not in any of my basic text books. Quite disappointed 
 "Team-Based Strategic Planning: A Complete Guide to Structuring, Facilitating and Implementing the Process" is one of those dense, impenetrable tomes blessed with having the American Management Association for its publisher. Hence, it smacks of authority.   Yet the book is written in a nearly unreadable language: the language of management-speak, uttered to obfuscate rather than enlighten, to deflect rather than engage.  One does not have to go far before running into verbal blockades such as this: "Organizations with an existing plan, however good or poor, should preface a plan update or total ground up revision with an upfront step: a review of the existing mission, plan, and accomplishments." Other similar all-star collections of jargon appear on nearly every page.   Shall we spend a moment considering this thought? First, people not organizations are the doers. Does "however good or poor" modify the existing plan or the organizations? Can there exist a nonexistent plan? Can a "ground up revision" be used for mulching the perennial garden? Can you actually preface and update, plus be upfront, in the same sentence? Finally, it's clear that organizations without existing plans will not be able to review their existing plans.  Language is not the only barrier. Some charts are full of type faces, sometimes six or more, calling to mind ransom notes assembled from letters clipped from magazines. Others are collections of thick symbols and unfriendly bold type and all caps that scream out MOCK IMPORTANCE.  My advice is to look for management advice that is dispensed in clear English with understandable graphics. [...] 
 Since I paid for the book - I finished it. Not worth it. Incoherent story, too many characters with hardly any description, no clarity. Nobody really cares in the end what happens 
 The product has far too complicated setup process. The product itself worked well enough after all the steps in the setup. 
 Well, the good part is you gotta love Anna Faris.  She plays the ditz with such sincerity...Great.  But this movie...not funny.  Oh it had a  couple moments but over all, this movie was a total waste of brain tissue 
 I never recieved this book.  I have no clue what has happened. 
 The higher than average rating on the All Music Guide should have given me a clue; after all, the rock critic mafia only bestows high marks on uncompromising (read unmelodic) work, eschewing the hits that we mere mortals seem to enjoy.  Dancing about architecture, anyone?  I cannot recall a single memorable tune on this album which, aside from that Gothic Archies EP/coaster, is the only Merritt album I have ever returned.  One or two listens is all it takes to discern magic from tedium.  I left Eban & Charley at the listening post, won't even touch Pieces of April and am now officially worried about 'I'.  Has the well run dry 
 Don't waste your money on this high chair.  By the time your infant can safely sit in it, they will have almost outgrown it.  You're just paying for the name brand, not the quality.  Stick w/ a Graco instead 
 I read a LOT of books of this genre (and admit to liking chick movies as well), but here's the thing: just because the character is a single 20 or 30-something on the lookout for love does not a story make.  This genre is so popular that the criteria for a story must be low...sell, sell, sell!  The characters are SO FLAT I didn't even care if they got together.  Their relationship was based on sex (we get NO dialogue hardly at all between the two), so why should we root for this affair?  The only character who is vaguely interesting is the "other woman" (his actual wife) and I didn't like her either.  Not only do the characters need depth, but the story draaaaaags on and really doesn't take us anywhere.  There is no richness to the setting.  It's all just cookie-cutter boring.  There is hope!  If you want some good chick lit with character development, try getting some Fiona Walker books and skip this one.  Marian Keyes is fun too (except for Angels).  I just find it hard to identify with an adultress with no personality, I guess!  Please don't waste the money and borrow it if you insist 
 I rented this movie on VHS because that was teh only formate they had. I think its pretty FReaking Lame. The Sport Sequeces are cool, but aside from that it was very boring. Basicly i Think this movie was yet another example of Hollywood Movie Trash 
 I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier 
 This book will tell you nothing about "history". It reads more like a novel and uses a series of literary devices which do violence to the material it deals with. Human history is not a story - why should it be, it doesn't have an "author". Real rubbish 
 Larry is funny in the way that Joe Theisman's leg break is funny. If you want racist trash disguised as "aw shucks, I'm just being honest," humor then this book is for you. Of course his jokes do contain farts which I find endlessly amusing. Just not enough.  Tera Delu 
 Just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children; movies have ratings for a reason.  This movie is rated PG-13, which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children.  In this case, it is crude humor. What I don't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience, and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience shouldn't see it 
 This software is "One Time Use"! If you have a notebook and laptop, you won't be able to install for both!   It sucks 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 We design custom homes and sell a custom component package to customers in the USA.  About 15% of my customers are owner contractors and I have worked with over 50 owner builders in the past ten years. This book is deceptive in that it exaggerates the potential savings and downplays the potential pitfalls. A typical custom home contractor has a 15% profit margin based on National Home Builders Association reports, I concur with that as well. Saving 25% is a dream unless you not only act as the contractor but do much of the work yourself. For every successful owner built project I see there are 5 that are a complete fiasco.  Unless you have considerable carpentry and building experience, know how to deal with subcontractors and all the pitfalls of working with them, and have full time to devote to you homebuilding project then don't even attempt to build your own house! Keep your sanity and marriage intact and hire a good contractor.  My experience with owner builders is that they don't know how to negotiate with the trades, they are unaware of the workmans comp insurance and lien pitfalls and in many cases they pay the subcontractors more than they should because of their inexperience.  Save the cost of this book and go to a movie instead.  Unless you are the unusual one in ten owner builder who has all the right skills and the personality to handle a difficult learning curve you would be well advised to look elsewhere for saving money, perhaps building a slightly smaller house with a contractor  would be a wiser option and in most cases the contractor built house will be much better built and worth much more money when all is said and done.  Spend some time doing research on the web about being your own contractor and read about all the horror stories.  You don't make your own car, sew your own clothes, grow your own food, or assemble your television. Use good common sense and realize that owner building you home is a crap shot at best and a personal and financial catastrophe at worst.  The best thing I can say about this book is that it will give you a good overview of the process of homebuilding but it will in no way equip you for the realities of building your own home. There is no substitute for long term experience, this book makes a toad look like a prince, pretty far fetched in my experience 
 First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.   The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.   She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.   Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much "living through others" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.  The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.  Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:  cf.en.cl  In conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution. One could call it propaganda.  - 22yo housewife and part-time science/engineering majo 
   It is difficult for me to avoid the clich of saying I feel ripped off by Fraud, so I'll just get writing that out of the way right off the bat. Looking over the other reviews here, I don't understand how more readers don't feel the same way.  Writer David Rakoff's collection of essays leaves a taste of disappointment in my mouth that won't go away, made worse by the fact that he makes it clear he could do so much better. There's no doubt that he's a talented writer with a great feel for words -- albeit unusually large ones -- and a keen eye for the absurd. He's lived a very interesting life, full of improbable events and unforgettable personalities. I'd probably even consider reading another of his books. But I honestly hope to never crack open Fraud again.  I think Mr. Rakoff seriously overestimated how interested the world is in his internal anguish, his bitter naval gazing, and the way he looks down his nose at the rest of us. The book is needlessly complicated, packed with obscure references and unnecessary 50-cent words. And because of the combination of those factors, the book doesn't ever really gel: it's as if Mr. Rakoff is trying to appear cleverly and profoundly self-deprecating, but with a superiority complex. I don't think it can be done, yet Mr. Rakoff tries time and time again.  It's tempting to think that Fraud's weaknesses could have been fixed by the right editor, but the more I think about it the less convinced I am that such a person exists. I now think Mr. Rakoff would be better off starting over and this time repeating to himself another clich as he starts each page: "keep it simple, stupid. 
 Ever met someone who hates summer? Ask Bobby Marks the main character of One Fat Summer by Robert Lipsyte. At the age of 14 Bobby is over 200 pounds. His dad is ashamed of him because he does not like to go places with him or be seen with him in public with him.  Bobby also feels bad about being fat because Willie beats him up and teases him.    Bobby's mom and sister really care about him and don't care that he is fat.  Bobby's best friend Joanie also gets picked on about her nose and then she leaves and does not tell Bobby why.  By the end of the book something drastic happens which makes the story a whole lot more interesting.  I think that the book One Fat Summer is a total waste of time because it has too many confusing parts like in the beginning of the book Bobby and Joanie say that they have a project due at the end of the summer and close to the end they say what are we going to do for our project but at the end they say nothing else about it.  I cant tell you much about the ending but you will be shocked that most of the is OK but to end the book on such a sour note.  I would not recommend this book to any one because of the confusing parts and a horrible ending.                     
 Accidents happen because of an amalgamation of errors, not simply because of one person's "human error".  Design faults, management pressures, poor training, long shifts, poor device interfaces, insufficent safety guards, poor maintenance, and many other issues come together to afford an accident that would not have caused that accident alone.  Finding root cause enables blame to be placed and make the rest of the system feel "safe" while latent problems still linger.  Safety is created by fostering a culture that sees risks for what they are and works to minimize those risks (better training, better safety guards, lessening worker fatigue) and NOT by placing blame on one "root cause" 
 This book is a classic example of why PBS should have its taxpayer life support plug pulled when they employ a leftist to give us his "unbiased" view of the world on "News Hour."  His fellow leftist and plagiarist, Goodwin, I guess is the "balance" for his views.  This book is so much nonsense that I don't know where to start in pointing out its complete abandonment from any semblance of journalistic honesty.  But if you are a Kool-Aid leftist, you will love this book. If you have more than a fifth-grade education, you will wonder why you wasted your two dollars to buy it. 
 The use of Soviet bloc sources, at first glance, nearly persuaded me that Reagan merits hero-worship. But the superficial handling of the 1946 Hollywood strike made me wonder, in general, about omissions. So, I scanned through the index. There is no entry for "Beirut" or "Lebanon" or "marine barracks" or "national debt." The author informs the reader that marines diverted, at sea, from Beirut landed on Grenada on February 23, 1983. He does not inform the reader that, on February 23, 1983, over 200 marines were killed by a truck bomb in Beirut. What a startling coincidence! How can the author fail to mention it? But, of course, then he does not have to report the cut and run from Beirut - nor consider what the terrorists may have learned about the efficacy of asymmetric war comparing the firm response in Grenada to the limp response in Lebanon.  Upon consideration, this book did not push me from the opinion I formed several years ago that Ronald Reagan is the third most overrated President in American history. 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 By now (December 12, 2004) we've learned a few facts about self-promoting blowhard BERNARD KERIK. How marvelous that "The Lost Son" has already been optioned for development as a major motion picture - it has the potential to become the funniest biopic since "Mommie Dearest." I do hope the screenwriter will include a role for JENNIFER LOPEZ as the illegal domestic worker (J-Lo was great in "Maid in Manhattan") and wouldn't MARGARET CHO be wonderful as Bernie's abandoned Korean daughter 
 My god what have these guy's done. What a mixed mess. Josh Silver used to produce a band called pist-on and there cd was called NO 1. Well this should be called NO 2. Because it sure smells like it. Better yet there last cd should have been called DEAD and this one DEAD AGAIN. ILL bet Roadrunner Records are glad to get rid of these guy's. They take a 10 minute song and make it sound like 20 minutes, Its like the energizer bunny it goes on an on and on and on. They have one song that sounded pretty good but than they have to ruin it with a stupid Russian chant. It's an old saying if it ain't broken don't fix it. You guy's better go back listen to some of your old cd's and WAKE UP, WAKE UP. Call you next cd Awake Again 
 XTC's "Go 2" was the band's second album of 1978, and it shows signs of being hastily recorded and put out before the material was as ready.  Largely the same thing only different as their debut, "White Music", the best material on "Go 2" show signs of things to come, but the majority of it is largely forgettable ska/punk new wave.  Admittedly, the album certainly opens well enough, with "Meccanik Dancing (Oh We Go!)" being an energetic mechanical rock piece like those that would be all over the next few albums with a loping bassline, skanking guitars and an odd, shouted vocal.  The second piece "Battery Bridges (Andy Paints Brian)", finds songwriter Andy Partridge channelling Brian Eno (considered for producer of the album) for this churning, "Another Green World"-like number whose serene nature provides a great offset to the opener.  Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there, moving from one forgettable ska-tinged new wave piece ("Red") to another ("Life is Good in the Grenhouse").  It also doesn't seem to matter whether its Partridge ("Jumping in Gomorrah"), bassist Colin Moulding ("Buzzcity Talking") or organist Barry Andrews ("My Weapon") who writes the piece, there's not much going on-- none of it's bad (well, ok, "My Weapon" is pretty bad), it just doesn't grab you.  The notable exception is the punky power chord workout "Crowded Room", Moulding's best early contribution to the band that's loaded with energy even if the vocal line can get stunningly annoying (well, ok, not nearly as annoying as the chorus of "My Weapon"...).  One thing that is notable about the album is the artwork, where rather than including some sort of photograph it instead has an essay describing the marketing intent of each component of the artwork in sarcastic fashion.  This reissue has been remastered and sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday.  Unfortunately, like "White Music", it does serve to nicely date the recording significantly, but the sound is fantastic.  The remaster also adds an early single as a bonus track-- "Are You Receiving Me?"-- which had also been included in some versions of the album.  It's actually a decent new wave track, with a driving rhythm and some of Moulding's best early bass playing.  All in all, "Go 2" is really a subpar effort.  It was clearly rushed out and suffers from a total lack of development of ideas as well as not enough good ideas to fill a record.  The band would fare much better in the future (including "Go 2"'s followup, "Drums and Wires"), this one is probably only for fans 
 It's good to know how an editor think about the scientific writing, but practically the book is not helpful if you want to learn writing rather than editing. The author has never written scientific papers by himself. He has no idea how to orgnize the data and make a convincing story.   I have read many beautiful scientific papers in prestigeous journals. How come those authors have not written a book??  Also Day's book is too old. Now day nobody would like to draw graphs if there is software available. 
 Far too little about Jededian himself.  Probably no more than a couple of pages at best.  Spent the whole book talking about other figures in detail like Ashley.  Smith was treated like an obscure character that played a very small role during that period, when in fact he was one of he few icons 
 I was honestly pretty excited about this book until I began to read it.  I didn't feel the book did a very good job of giving you any specifics, rather just broad ideas and tid-bits of legal issues and stories.  The book did a great job of plugging the associated website every other page almost.  I went to the website hoping for someone to help find my dream home, filled out all my info, and still have not heard back from anyone.  That was atleast 6 months and counting 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well.  thanks for asking  pgammon 
 I bought the book on a recommendation a year back and tried to read it but failed to concentrate enough as it was a pretty dense book. Recently I picked it up again, this time determined to finish it as it is considered an important work.  I have forced myself and it takes forever to get through a single page. Either the author or the translator did a lousy job. I wonder if the original is easier to decipher. I ended up putting the book down on page 111 (a third into the book). Do not waste your time with this book. Foucault may have been a great philosopher who had an impact on many other scholars but I wouldn't know because i cant understand what he wrote.   HAHAHAHAH LET ME DEMONSTRATE WHAT I MEAN AS I QUOTE FROM THE BOOK (p.23), SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING ON YOUR FIRST TRY:  "Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing or useful effect, according to one's point of view, see whether there is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive from a single process of 'epistemologico-juridical' formation; in short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the humanization of the penal system and the knowledge of man."  NOT AS BAD AS FINNEGAN's WAKE, but it sure comes close 
 Somewhat useful for those ignorant of France.  However, Ardagh is for all the modernist leftist ideals.  Abortion is good.  Feminism is delightful.  Socialism is grand as long as it doesn't go too far.  Anything traditionalist belongs in the wastebasket.  Now that France is slowly dying and maybe a generation away from social upheaval, one must understand that Ardagh's idealizing modern France is mistaken.  France, modern France, Ardagh's France, is going down the tubes 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 Completely fails to discuss the most fantastic and least logical idea promulgated withing the last 200 years, that life in all of its variation evolved from a series of random accidents.  As for criticism of the aquatic ape theory, it's far more logical than other "mainstream" theories and most scientists have ran from this theory without even attmepting to evaluate it. After all, it was written by a woman in a man's profession so why should it be taken seriously 
 I bought the CD since I was going to see Crossfade open up for Alter Bridge and I liked Cold the first couple of times I heard it.  Then I listened to the rest of the CD.  Words can't explain how bad it is.  Cheesy rap-rock with over-used power chords is probably the best description.  The songs all sound the same.  The lyrics border on ridiculous. And to boot, they are even worst in concert.  Most of the people sat and watched them act like kids on stage while a group of 5 high school kids banged their heads to the music.  They have a dj who messes around with turn tables and tries to rap, with the keyword tries.  He is the most pathetic want-a-be that I have ever seen.  After 2 listens, I gave the cd to my little sister who loves Cold.  This is a terrible band and a terrible release 
 I like the concept of this book and I have no problem with its selections.  However, I find that there isn't very much said about each of these business books.  While historical context is provided for each, there is little that gives me a new perpective on things or provides me with something that I can apply.  It is like viewing historical documents in a museum without there being a description of why they're relevant or how they impact the present day.  I prefer the more vibrant discussion found in "The Guru Guide.&quot 
 "Houseboat" never arrived here.  I have been patiently waiting at the dock, but no boat.  PLEASE send it at once 
 I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly 
 I purchased this based on the reviews here at Amazon. I am an architect and I thought it would contain traditional details and construction methods....it does not. What it does have is small black and white pictures of "do's" and "don'ts" for such building components as arches, dormers, water tables, etc. Very much a primer for those who do not have a working knowledge or understanding of good construction practices or techniques. Great, but needlessly expensive, book for the freshman student of architecture, or layman who scratches their head when looking at a McMansion while trying to figure out just what makes it so darned ugly (proportion, scale, details). There are better choices out there for half the money 
 This has got to be the worst book I've read in a long time.  As someone in their 20s, I decided to read the book as, as the authors do point out, not many books and movies cater directly to young adults who are past college but not yet parents.  That being said, this book is a complete disappointment.  The book is nothing more than ramblings of college graduates who complain that secretary work is "demeaning" and that they're upset that people "stupider" than them have better jobs.  This book caters only to middle-class/upper-middle class readers.  The book is ultimately all that is wrong with America.  No mention is made of poorer young adults, and even well-off young adults who choose not to go to college.  The book ultimately is gossipy and filled with shallow complaints.  Also, very little is offered to help a young person deal with problems.  The only way I'd use this book again is if the heat is turned off in my apartment.  Then I'd burn it for heat and fuel 
 I have disconnected this cable TWO times only to temporarily relocate the TV and guess what - Yes, one of the pins got bent and broke off.  Now this expensive cable is just a worthless piece of junk.  Don't by this Monster Cable - try a different brand 
 These pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well. It could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong 
 I just purchased this cd for my son. I was assuming it would be cute little songs to help him memorize his addition facts. Well, this cd has songs but they are mixed with this freaky story telling bits that are just plain weird. We got through the first several songs/stories before turning it off because the narrator/singer's voice (who sounded like he had smoked 5 packs of cigarrettes his entire life) on Stella's rag, actually scared my son and he hasn't wanted to listen to it since. 
 This book starts out strong.  It seemed like it was going to be the best Pitt novel I had read to date.  But then enters the completely unbelievable plot to save the day.  I suggest reading the first 100 pages and then moving to another book 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 Mr. Segev has written yet another history of Israel.  THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence.  He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration.  His argument is simple.  THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel.  This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong.  For a less biased account I would recommend "From time immemorial".  For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'.  Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course).  Be careful with this book it is biased 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with the product.  They were not all that tender and certainly not worth what I paid for the produc 
 This is a great show with great writing and acting.  Unfortunatly I had to purchase & return this 3 times (season 1).  Once from Circuit City, twice from Amazon. The 1st disc freezes and skips and is basically unwatchable.  I think Amazon should pull his item from its inventory and complain to the manufacturer. They should have never put this on a double sided dvd 
 The blanket worked, for 3 weeks. Now the controller just keeps blinking E. It wont reset, it wont warm. I cannot return it to amazon, It's been longer than 30 days, as I purchased it ahead of time as a christmas gift. I wont do that again 
 The majority of the information in this guide is readily available on the web. I was hoping to learn something new. The photographs are small and many out of focus. Not very colorful and nothing new. If you are savy on the net you can get 90% of this information for free and word for word much of the text is available on Mexico Connect 
 Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger. 
 This is a great movie with a mistaken rating.  If your three year old is enjoying this movie, please re-think what you show your children.  REALLY 
 You can read some of the other reviews to get an idea of some of the specific errors...  The book is loaded with them from wrong moves to other typos...  How can this book help anyone if half the battle is trying to figure out whats going on...  He has quotes from people in years that they already were dead...  Games with wrong year and people listed...  Sad that they still publish books from this author...  I do not understand why they let books out with so many errors...  When I buy a chess book I expect it to have almost no errors...  This book has more errors than actual things that help players...  If you give this to someone and tell them to find all the errors...  They woudl probably have grandkids and still not find them all...  I dunno what he means by Golden Nuggets...  I think more work went into thinking of name of book than content...  Books like this give chess books a bad name to say very least...  If you want a book on chess strategy try Watson's Advances since Nimzo...  Even The Mammoth Book of Chess will help you more than this item...  Perhaps even consider Silman's Strategy Grandmaster Techniques from A to Z book.  Hopefully one of those books might help you in your game and give you value for your dollar.. 
 Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review. These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone.  If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs.  (My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!)  Regards,  Older But No Smarter 
 I bought this for my cavalier after watching the Petsmart commercial. I understand it is not the same toy, but it bears some resemblence. It came in a dreadful yellow color and was not extremely well made. It was a soft, somewhat cottony/furry texture, not loofah! I couldn't tell you if it is durable, because he hasn't played with it enough to actually rip it.  It contains two squeakers that scare him.  My guess is some dogs would like this toy, the shape is pleasing to dogs, I think my dog just didn't like the texture. I reccommend anything by Fat Cat Inc. in place of this toy 
 To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering.  
 The book is difficult to read, at best, and although I did find some helpful ideas, it is not a book on Contemplation, much less on the contemplative heart. It is more a treatess on psychology of the contemplative. Most of the book deals with meditation not comtemplation. The author made no attempt to really deal with the difference between meditation and contemplation. If you are interested in anyalyzing the contemplative from a clinical psycologist viewpoint then this might very well be the book to help you. But if you are trying to understand your own heart and move further towards God, this is probably not going to help. Plus his use of words and thoughts are very cumbersome. I have thrown my book in the trash. 
 Cameron Diaz has no acting ability except to giggle, smile and make angry tense, facial expressions.  You meet all the characters. They are all over acted (except Diaz, who just walks around looking stupid). They have all sorts of conflicts. They spill their guts in scenes that are suppose to be sad, but laced with humor. Everyone realizes they should treat each other better and learn to understand each other. The middle is the only part where a couple of interesting things happened - the beginning and ending where completely awful. And there was really no resolution to the title "In Her Shoes" other than Cameron Diaz's character taking and using (and ruining) various pairs of shoes (yawn). While this movie had a couple of moments that were interesting, at the end I just rolled my eyes and regretted wasting the 2 hours. 
 This book helpfully points out the massive worldwide cabal promoting this ridiculous global warming conspiracy.  Their spies are everywhere!  In fact, those same conspiracists are monitoring every post placed on this very website!  They're watching you right now.  Look out, they're behind you!  Other conspiracies that have been helpfully debunked throughout history:  The Holocaust The Moon Landing Elvis' Death 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I listened to the unabridged version on tape.  I enjoy audio books because I'm able to work at the same time (I paint).  So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time.    Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.  However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel 
 For an 800 page novel, it was surprising how sparse the story was.  The premise was interesting, and based on the first hundred-odd pages, I thought I was in for a very good read.  Unfortunately, 'Passage' turned out to be less than thrilling.  There's no doubt Willis has an engaging style - how else to explain why I sat through page after page of endless plot repetition?  She's easy to read; her prose is clear and flows well, and it was clear to me that the constant traipsing back and forth through the maze-like halls of Mercy General by her characters was a sort of uber-metaphor in a book about NDE and metaphors.  And that's just it - it was clear to me after the first few dozen pages - why keep hitting the reader over the head with it?  Additionally, there was absolutely no character development.  Hell, there were no real characters to begin with - you can't make a five-course gourmet meal out of a cardboard box and a turnip.  The characters were merely mouthpieces to expound an interesting, but ultimately boring, theory.  You might even say the characters themselves were only metaphors.  The relationships between the characters are totally undeveloped, with the exception of the protagonist, Dr. Lander, and her friend Maisie, a little girl in ICU waiting on a new heart.  But even there, the relationship turns out to be - guess what?  That's right.  A metaphor.  My last gripe is not so much with Ms. Willis or this book itself as it is with the marketing of the book.  When I pick up a book in the science-fiction section of my local bookstore, I expect to read a science-fiction book, which 'Passage' is clearly not.  It's a metaphysical and philosophical exploration, sure, but absolutely not scifi.  Based on the strength of her writing ability (after all, I DID read an 800 page book about nothing), I'll try one of her other works, but I won't hold my breath expecting something fascinating 
 Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue 
 Sondheim is regarded as being a "musical genius" but I would strongly disagree. While his music is certainly complex (bordering on chaotic), he has yet to evoke any emotion or passion in his music. His melodies are pretty, witty, complex or intellectual. Never gorgeous.   With that said, Sweeny Todd is definitely his best work. There are a few good numbers in here. "Joanna" is a pretty tune and so is "Not While I'm Around" but, again, not gorgeous. My personal favorite has always been "Kiss Me", a lyrically witty love declaration between the two young lovers.  Everyone always criticizes Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which, in my opinion, is often luscious, sweeping and dramatic. It evokes the days of Puccini and even Rogers & Hammerstein. I'll admit Andrew Lloyd Webber is far from brilliant and he is famous for using the most insipid lyricists in the history of musical theatre, but Sondheim's music is incapable of approaching the gorgeousness of Webber's work. Now I will say that if you attend a Sondheim musical, you're in for an intellectually stimulating experience.  Just because music is intellectual does not mean it's wonderful. Sometimes intellectual is just that. When I go to the theatre, I want to be moved, not quizzed. Sondheim needs to learn how to compose melodies that, at least, follow some form or structure and don't simply drift off into A-tonal murkiness. An audience can't be expected to cry or experience emotions if the music isn't lifting them or taking them anywhere.   On last thought... Phantom of the Opera is the longest running show on Broadway...and there's a reason! It's moving. You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moves by the sweeping melodies. You can point out all of the show's shortcomings but you cannot deny that most of Webber's score is gorgeous. No matter who you are, if you go see Phantom of the Opera you will be moved. You could also see Sweeny Todd on Broadway and find it interesting and amusing. To say the least, you'll walk out of the theatre thinking, "Wow I was just intellectually stimulated! ALL RIGHT!"...and that's about it.  Webber's music IS musical theatre, Sondheim's music is like a sea of watercolors that bleeds into a murky mess 
 First of all I do think Toby Keith has talent. There are songs from his previous work that I like and prove his skill and talent as a songwriter and musician. With this album I fear that he is continuing a slide into self-parody and risks the possibility that he won't be taken seriously and he will become a caricature. One of the things I have respected about him was that early in his career he had the integrity to be himself and do the music he wanted to and not what the executives in Nashville wanted him to do. That's artistic integrity. But I fear that the niche he carved for himself might turn into a grave for his career. He found his place in country music as the rebellious macho outspoken country boy. But now that has become the formula which sells a product and he seems to be milking that formula for all the profit that its worth But he is losing his soul in the process and becoming at some level the very thing he rebelled against. Now he panders to a certain fan-base and risks encouraging every country/red-neck/hick stereotype, prejudice and clichï¿½ that can be so detrimental, divisive and harmful. The testosterone filled music which he helped popularize and is currently being played by artists such as Montgomery-Gentry will run's its course and fizzle in popularity. When that is done will anyone want to listen to Toby Keith anymore? I hope he gets back on track and instead of trying to please a certain demographic for temporary gain he looks within and writes music that has the possibility of becoming timeless. 
 This book is a fairly good introduction to Jefferson, although it is rather short for a biography of one of our most intelligent presidents.  The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms.  The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey.  His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book.  Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man.  Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short.  If you want a short summation of Jefferson, then this book will suffice 
 This is not a tour guide and nether is Motel Americana by the same Author a Guide. My reason for buying this book was because I was planning a road trip. this book is absolutely no help.  what a mistake. From now on I will read the reviews before purchasing a boo 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 If this is a horror novel, then I may be also a candidate to be the new Stephen King because I have better stories under my belt than this drivel.  What starts great with chills of isolation from civilization and convincing youngster jealousies and contests turn into mediocre with werewolves, underground tunnels, City Inferno like scenes right down to terrible with fantasy-like drivels, gods and rituals....There are something like a storyline but you can never be sure and characters are jokes, shifting constantly from pure evil to pure good to pure couregous to full traitor. Horror factor drops below zero and freezes there.  Simply skip...I wish someone in Leisure Books had read this drivel before publishing it.   Now do I have to still a new Stephen King book to read a good horror story? No of course. But new authors do not show any promise, sorry 
 In the 80's, after Cats became the phenomenon it became, commercials for newly-opened Broadway musicals would often feature an audience member enthusiastically exclaiming "It's Better than CATS!" Just from watching these commercials, some of which where for Stinkers like QUILTERS, it would appear that anything was better than CATS. This video proves those commercials right. Anything IS better than Cats.  What can one say about CATS? Tony Kushner sums it up pretty well when he has a character in his opus ANGELS IN AMERICA proclaim faux-enthusiasticly that "It's about Cats! Singing, Dancing Cats!" That's pretty much all to it. Sure, there's a shoestring plot (a tribe of cats have gathered together to decide which one of them gets to go to Kitty Heaven and get reincarnated. Or something. And somehow it won the Tony award for best Book of a musical), but CATS is one irrelevant song away from a musical review. About a dozen cats get a number about how special they are: This one is a magician, that one works on a train, another is some sort of master Criminal. At random points, they stop to dance irrelevantly and, at one point, have what a friend referrs to as "a cat orgy".  Taken at face value, such an evening couldn't be more than a train wreck.  But CATS somehow draws you into it's world, for better or for worse. In the case of this video, however, it is definitely for worse.  CATS may prove magical in a live performance, but this video falls to capture even a shred of whatever attracts the audience to it onstage. The video direction and lighting reduces the magical junkyard set of John Napier into a garish, tacky Vegas spectacular (though some would claim that CATS is little more than that to begin with) and the choreography of Gillian Lynne, highly praised in the original London and Broadway mountings, seems amateurish and ugly onscreen. Without the crucial distractions of good direction and beautiful sets, the glaring flaws  in Andrew Lloyd Weber's score comes hurtling to the forefront of the conscious mind: repetitive, overblown and dull.  I'm not sure who's fault this is: The video Director's, Lynne's, or Lloyd Weber's, but it leaves a black hole in the center of the video.  You can do nothing but pity the poor actors involved, some of whom are very good: Michael Gruber dances well, sings well and brings the right gravitas to the tribe leader Munkustrap, Jo Gibb and Drew Varley are an engaging pair of cat burglars (get it?) and Jacob Brent has a fantastic dance turn as the Magical Mr. Mistofelees. Also deserving mention are the duo of Aeva May and Rosemarie Ford, who sexily croon  "Macavity", a jazz duet about a cat who is the "Napoleon of Crime", like nobody's business.  Best of all are two older members of the cast: Elaine Paige as the tragic Grizabella and Sir John Mills as Gus the Theater Cat. The 90-year old Mills charms everyone off the stage and sings (in a beautiful quivery tenor) with an earnestness that brings a tear to your eye, and Paige, the originator of her part, belts out the one listenable song, the famous "Memory" with aplomb.   The third senior cast member, Ken Page as the patriarch Deuteronomy, has little to do but sit and look magisterial, which he does well.  But on the other hand, John Partridge shakes his tail as The Rum Tum Tugger (an Elvis spoof) without an inch of sex appeal, and Susan McKenna is cloying and cutesy as the motherly Gumby Cat. Few of the other felines make any impression.   However fine CATS  may be onstage (and even that is debatable), this video is a dismal failure, capturing none of the magic and all of the silliness of musical theatre. It's things like this that give musicals a bad name. If I were you, I'd pretend you are a mouse and run far, far, away from these CATS. 
 for a novice sewer I found it to complicated to follow 
 If you call it a "novel," they can't sue you. Mantle's family must be mortified. This book is just slightly better than trash. There are actually a few baseball references but it is mostly mindless perversion masquerading as entertainment. 13 year-old boys might "get" something out of it. For the more "mature" reader, don't waste your time.  In regard to the reviewer who claims he knew Mickey Mantle and how Mickey was generous with "George's" money. Well, I'm sure Steinbrenner gave Mantle some money but it was long after Mantle retired and the memory of that reviewer appears to be as muddled as this "novel."  Are you a 13 year-old boy? Buy it. Hide it under the mattress. Don't let your mother find it. It's a travesty. It's utter filth. It dishonors his memory. A blatant money grab. That's all. 
 The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "Do you believe in Ghosts?"  The "lighter" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet "The Polar Express" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.      
 I can't find anything good to say about this book. I used to be a huge fan of Block's work but now a lot of it makes me cringe. This is her newest book and I received it as a Christmas gift. The plot sounded good in theory (Greek Myths modernized) but I should have known better. There's barely any book here. It's a very slim 116 pages and it's written in a "poetic" style that means each page of text barely has any text on it. It took me less than an hour to read it and I was confused for a lot of it. Half the time I didn't know which character was telling the story - what little story there was to be told. The little blurb describing the book is almost longer than the book itself. I know that I probably would have loved this back in high school (or at the very least pretended to love it) when I was obsessed with Block's work but now? I can honestly say that I threw it down in disgust when I was finished and wished I could have gotten that hour back. I really don't recommend this book to anyone who isn't a teenage girl obsessed with Block's work. 
 I read the first sixty pages of the novel and was not nearly as "delighted" as other readers, in spite of the fact that I am female, and such books about mother/daughter relationships are  "supposed" to be inherently appealing to me.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I found the pacing extremely slow.  Additionally, however, I found the characters, especially the central one--Materena--dull.  As far as I got, there was no real plot, and that in conjunction with unappealing "simple" characters--the writing tended to reinforce the stereotypical images I know from Gaugain's paintings of Tahitian women--made me quite happy to abandon the book.  There was not enough here for me to persist, and I frankly wonder why others were so charmed! I'd suggest trying to borrow this from the library rather than buying it 
 Gimme a break. Soooooo lame. 
 This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material. 0 stars 
 The whole point of this ghost story, is like in the orinigal, a surprise, twisted ending. Yet, once again, in a 90's Hollywood horror flick, it is dissappointing. The actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect,but, there not to blame. The blame is the poor script writing for this movie. The movie has you going until about half way through, when they introduce the ghost to you. Now, unlike any other ghost in Hollywood history, this ghost is literally a black blob. It contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face, which in turn, reveals the face of whom it kills. But, literally, when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie, you better make sure its in the right one. This movie should probably been called The Blob, not House on Haunted Hill. It is a horrible re-make and a waste of about 2 hours. Please, for your own sake, rent some good genre horror, like Halloween or When a Stranger Calls. Not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in. Better luck next time to the director, producer, co- producer, and writer of this film, because of all the people that took part, probably just wanted to make some cheap money, so they made a movie. Better luck next time 
 This movie was disappointing.  The fat kid didn't fart enough.  I like farting.  He should have farted more often 
 when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media...... 
 Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important. Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO 
 I have seen both performers in person on several occasion.Thought both were terrific.Couldn't wait to play CD.It was difficult to listen to.Some songs actually made me cringe.I couldn't listen to it all at once.I kept waiting for it to get better,it never did.The producer is Tommy Krasker,what was he thinking?The liner notes mention "There's a lot of great material out there that would like to meet you,Mr. and Mrs. Danieley",aparently Mr. Krasker choose not to introduce them.What a waste of talent.Next time I hope they get better advice and direction 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 Christianity has created an Arch enemy of the Creator for which intrigue youth and those who deeply feel that "God" hates and/or abandons them for what ever reason.  These feelings are steeped in "less than" and fear based teachings.  When someone believes they are reject of "God" their creator, they will seek out acceptance.  Just reading the first few pages of this book it became clear to me this had nothing to do with Satanism, but rather mixed up, kids - identifying with the Christian and Hollywood context of "Satanism" for shock factor.  "Pentagrams carved into my arms...", well a Pentagram has nothing to do with Satanism, and is an ancient symbol representing the 4 elements and the 5th element of "Spirit".  Kids would not have these delusions about "Satan" or "Satanism" if they were not taught them to be later used for "shock" factor.   They would not become obsessed with evil if the "Good" religions of the world would cease their obsession and teachings of "command and control", and "less than" theologies.  If your interested in learning about "Satanists" go visit their website, ask them questions, learn about why and how they came into existence.  Truth Filter #5 - "All serves and is subject to the Divine" - Satan, adopted somewhere around 240AD from Arab Jinn legends, became a powerful tool for "The Church".  Satanism, (not to be confused with Luciferians), is fairly recent "Church" which was founded I believe in the 80's in California.  They stand in bold defiance to Church Hypocrisy, some would say "Christian" hypocrisy.  Keep in mind that "Satanist" is a Roman Term, meaning adversary of the "The Church", specifically "The Church of Rome", known today as "The Roman Catholic Church".  Technically - if you "oppose" the Roman Catholic Church, or any of its dogma's or teachings - then "technically" based on the origins of the label "Satanist", you would be a "Satanist".  Keep in mind this title had little to do with your belief or no-belief in Satan.  Those who would wear a "Pentagram", the "Witches", or the Pagans did not, and do not believe in "Satan".  In fact, I am not certain Satanists "believe" in Satan, but Satan does serve their role and mission which is to annoy Christians and make them "think".  Truth and Historical Facts are interesting things.  Do your own research.   There will be "weirdo" and troubled people who will turn to the name "Satan" and align themselves with "evil" for the shock factor and attention getting of "evil".  Some may even claim to take directions by "Satan", many mental patients have cited demons and Satan as the cause for their problems.  We blame evil and Satan for many things that happen in our lives.  The real "seduction" & "evil" happened many thousands of years and was backed by many attrocities.  It is good that you are seeking truth.  The answers and solutions are rooted in Love, and learning that you are not "less than".

 The authors try to illustrate the materials as clearly as they can, they likely to speak the same things "in other words" to prevent the readers to misunderstand the contents; it is good, but they should write the text more simplify, do not use a lot of words and sentences to introduce the same idea. For example, they use one chaper to explan a simple formula, and through whole book, you can find many pages contains a lot of words, but just one or two sentences of them is the improtant notion you want to know. I suggest the authors should think about non-native readers, try to use little words to write the book. Do not speak one thing again and again, like gossip women. The advantages of this book is it contains many tables and pictures, it let users easy to undersatanding the materials.    
 Like "Wittgenstein's Poker" this book turns a single event in the lives of two important philosophers into a full-length book.    Where one book concerned a possible fight, here it's a meeting which is believed by Stewart to have caused a painful conversion-epiphany in Leibniz, the conservative courtier. Both works are lively, good reads, but that's where the similarity ends.  While "Wittgenstein's Poker," at least in the main, gets analytical philosophy, logical positivism, and ordinary language philosophy right, Stewart makes quite a mess of Leibniz. In fact, while he has an advanced degree in philosophy, he seems to have a very limited understanding of either of his subject's main works.  And, unfortunately, what he does seem to get right, he feels the need to explain by the main thesis of his book--that Leibniz was a closet Spinozist for most of his life and only pretended to disagree with him to protect his status.    I can't go into the details of these errors in a brief review of this type, but Leibniz's understanding of necessity was very different from Spinoza's and Stewart's limited understanding of modal logic has produced a hash, rather than anything coherent out of Leibniz's "best of all possible worlds" claim (which, while it may be difficult to believe, can at least be made coherent if one understands the notion of possible worlds in the manner of that philosopher).  Stewart's botching of Leibniz is clear and will be fairly obvious to students of that philosopher's works, but his take on Spinoza (on whom I wrote my own Ph.D. thesis) is hazier and, as a result, arguably not so awful.  I do think, though, that Spinoza's notions of "salvation" and intuitive knowledge can only be made to  jibe with this book after considerable analysis and explication--very little of which can be found here.  At any rate, I learned a good deal about the life, times and psychological make-up of these men, for which I'm grateful to the author 
 How the hell can you make a movie with talking monkeys totally suck?  It should have been a slam dunk 
 The Dead's popularity has eluded and confounded me for decades. Lots of folks I like and respect love the band, such has Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, and it was because of his Consumer Guide review that I gave this live album a listen. But like wow man. The fact that nobody in the band can carry a tune or that the lyrics are bereft of a single coherent thought, pales next to the realization that the muscianship is one long guitar(s) noodle with background drumming that seems to be following its own talentless path. It's like bad jazz played by deaf people. The audience, when you can hear them, sound stoned...which is apparantly the only way one can appreciate this music. Around this same time or a little after, CCR recorded a song called "Ramble Tamble" that outjams, rocks, and otherwise destroys anything on this disc. And they do it in seven minutes! The evidence on this record confirms my belief that, along with The Doors, The Grateful Dead are the most overrated rock band of the period. All you young ones that don't know any better, stick with the Stones and The Velvet Underground. You'll be better off 
 Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only. 
 1. THE BOOK LATE IN ARRIVE  2. RECEIVED THE BOOK INCORRECT  
 Back To The Future is an awesome movie but the soundtrack is only so-so! The only really good tracks in this soundtrack are the two songs from Huey Lewis And The News and The instuemental back To The Future Overture. The rest is just filler! I agree with the reviewer who said they should have put Mr. Sand Man in the soundtrack. It's a good song 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 It is an axiom of nature that for intimacy, impression, or insight that both a male prong and a female receptacle are necessary. Such technical utility is carried over into even our electric plugs and wall sockets for illumination.  Which is why poignant critical works and reviews of President George H.W. Bush's presidency are the more useful volumes to turn to, for Rebel-in-Chief: Inside the Bold and Controversial Presidency of George W. Bush pierces nothing. This is a flaccid, feeble, vapid work.  Rebel-in-Chief is of the orifice-pressed-firmly-to-the-sphincter class of hagiography, and fails both on its merits and its mission. Barnes holds himself out as a suburban Republican everyman intellectual of the not-too-deep variety. Perhaps this is the most telling dimension of the work, for if Barnes and his doppelgangers are either seeking to understand Bush's vision with this critical appraisal, or are his last wall of apologetic defence it is a sure sign of a failed Presidency. Everyone remembers from college that at the first siren of real trouble the smiling and backslapping Future-Salesman-of-America disappear leaving the trash and evidence pinned on the dim, the confused, and those who arrived late. When the centre does not hold, a rough beast indeed slouches toward Bethlehem to be born, and then it is brutes who must clean up the mess 
 This short little book contains three essays that move from the exoterically esoteric to the downright incomprehensible.  Like Kabbalah itself is often assumed to be, Bloom's thinking is like a Gnostic nugget - albeit without the imaginative cosmology that Gnosticism historically had - where the first essay is like the outside of the pomegranate, the second essay like the layer around the pomegranate and the third essay the actual fruit.  Kabbalah and Criticism is set within a Scholem-esque historiography but with one thing missing: the Messiah which, in Bloom's work, never appears - indeed, one can wonder whether or not the Messiah is ever coming at all!  The actual fruit turns out to be empty and emptying; rather than taking us anywhere, Kabbalah and Criticism simply leaves the reader hanging.  The first essay is an explanation of the major themes in Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah, focusing primarily on its Zoharic (13th century) and Lurianic (15th & 16th century) manifestations.  Kabbalah is usually considered fairly esoteric; ironically, this essay is the most exoteric in the entire book.  It is clear that Bloom has digested the writings of Gershom Scholem - the brilliant mind who first brought Jewish mysticism into academic credibility in the 20th century - and it is from within this Scholem-esque framework that Bloom operates.  In the second essay, however, Kabbalah is clearly shown to not actually be a map of the world, but a type of two-dimensional signifier in which the various interactions between the the Ten Sefirot exist not as signifiers pointing to the reality of God, but as signifiers pointing to the fact that texts themselves interact with each other and that the interaction is not found first and foremost in the texts or the Sefirot, but in the space between them.  Thus Kabbalah, rather than speaking of God, becomes a springboard for a literary theory.  Why it is that Kabbalah ought to be this springboard is never explained; given the commodification of all things Kabbalistic today, it seems that Bloom is no different, for Kabbalah is entirely unnecessary for his theory - it's just a useful heuristic, and nothing more.  The heuristic, furthermore, never actually serves to take the reader to any point of understanding.  Thus, for Bloom, Kabbalah is a series of symbols that interact within one another ad infinitum but because they are never anything more than that, nothing ever arrives in Kabbalah any more than in any text.  In short, Bloom's theory is entirely devoid of a Messiah: just as the symbols symbolize unendingly in Bloom's Kabbalistic maze (something that Scholem would have found quite hard to accept), so too does the text itself continually exist in need of re-reading - or, as Bloom prefers, *mis-reading*.  Literature is a series of misreadings, a confusion of interpretation with text by insisting that all interpretation *is* the text that is being interpreted.  By the time Bloom gets to this essay, he is so far from the Jewish mysticism that he began with that it becomes quite clear that Kabbalah is really quite superfluous to his whole theory.  He *mis-reads* Kabbalah and, in doing so, is only capable of arguing that interpretation - mis-reading - justifies itself.  If one is interested in Harold Bloom, the back of this book claims that "Kabbalah and Criticism may justly be regarded as the cardinal work in Harold Bloom's enterprise."  I honestly can't understand why anyone would bother, though, for its Kabbalism is vacuous and its criticism vapid.  Bloom is a brilliant guy, but because his Kabbalism lacks the possibility of a Messiah - a reading in which the text and the reader meet in a moment of deep meaning - Kabbalah and Criticism simply wanders in a desert of thin symbols lifted out of their historical context and it therefore begins to look not just like the Messiah will never come, but that there is no historical world for him to even come to 
 This book is merely a collection of simple organic chemistry problems. These problems are not passage or concept-based, and thus very poorly model MCAT-style questions.   Good points:   *1000 problems covering many topics which are best mastered through practice, such as stereochemistry, lab techniques, resonance and spectroscopy  Bad Points:   *Not worth what paid for. There are more, _better_ questions in your text-book. Sad, but true.  *The questions that resemble those found on the exam are few and far in between.   Other: If you're in the hurry phase of MCAT prep. you may find it useful to know that each question in this book takes about 20 seconds to do 
 Like most things from Entrepreneur, this book does not offer a lot of depth.  It is a good primer for someone considering starting a concierge business or errand service.  There are a few good ideas along with a lot of common sense that the average person will have figured out before buying the book.  Several times the author claims "there is no hard data available" - I worked in B2B market research for 9 years, I know reliable data can be developed by anyone who makes the effort.  This is the first book I've read on the topic, so I can't make other recommendations yet, but look for this at your library before paying money for it 
 William Nolen's original "The Making of a Surgeon" was a near epic inspirational recounting of one's surgical training.  It celebrated the training process that molded eager, talented young doctors into, what else, surgeons.  He portrayed a system that was necessarily grueling in order to insure that the products were worthy and capable of having people's very lives placed into their hands.  Miller's tale, on the other hand, is more the revisionist whining of a worker who believes his boss never appreciated his talents or efforts.  The entire book reads much like the faculty roast he recounts near the end: a steady spiteful payback; a re-vengeful, cathartic diatribe in which the targets are the very faculty and institution that tolerated him as a green, imperfect but promising young recruit and trained him to be a surgeon.  If your preference is inspiration, stick with the original.  If you enjoy wallowing in self-pity and pointing the fingers at others to explain your own shortcomings, you'll enjoy Miller's version 
 This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap.  I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up.  When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing 
 The horse is cute, but it does not have a smell (honey & spice) as the box said it would. The hair easily tangles, and when you try to comb it, it instantly falls out. We've had it one week and it's lost a lot of hair. A lot of the pieces are made of paper and don't even stand up - throw those straight in the trash. The hair bands aren't elastic enough to really work - it's hard even for an adult, so those don't get used much, either. (... 
 The movie itself was ok, especially Freddie bartholomew' acting.  But Spencer Tracy gave a horrible performance.  I sure hope he didn't win any awards for this.  He doesn't even come close to a Portugese accent, or any other kind of accent for that matter.  Spencer Tracy's take on a Portugeese accent is to talk in broken english.  Like they used to portray the Indian's in the old westerns. It comes off more as some sort of mentally deficient person speaking in broken english, such as 'Manuel no like you.  Wish you not here'.  It's got to be the worst accent in the history of film making.  And then there's the lack of realism.  Half the time there is no one steering the ship.  In real life, someone would be at the helm 24 hours a day.  On this ship, no one steers at night.  When the ship is racing back to port at the end of the movie, in the distant shots it's pounding through heavy 10 foot sea's.  But when they close in on the actors, the deck isn't moving at all.  They just stand there as if the ship were floating on a pond.  And at the end of the movie, when Spencer Tracy's character is cut in half below the waist.  He's not even in pain.  He survives in the water for at least 5 minutes with nothing but a torso and a head.  This is what really spoiled the movie.  The only saving grace is Freddie Batrholomew's portrayal of Harvey 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?"  "I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front."  "But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing."  "Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink." 
 I am the FAN in fanatic when it comes to baseball. If there is a book, I read it. If there is a game, I watch it. If Twins's tickets are available, I am there.  This is probably the worse baseball related book I have ever read. I like Will Carroll's column but he should stick with that style of writing but cause his book writing is awful. If you are looking for a book book on baseball or the subject of steroids, this sure ain't it 
 There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality 
 I think that this price is absolutely ridiculous! People dont buy these items for that ridiculous price, they are $3.25 at Walmart and Target. These toys are hard to find at Walmart and Target, but its because these sellers are taking them off the shelfs to rip people off in these sites. If the demand is high they will continue to rip people off. Don't buy from these sellers, and you will begin to find them at your local stores!!!! 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 I gave this two stars only because I got to see some characters I haven't in a long time. The writing is disjointed, poorly characterized and the art was so bad in the original that they had to fix or finish it here.  There do seem to be some revelations that the changes in this edition (versus the actual series) hint at, but at this point, who cares?  The story itself makes little sense. Characters are brought back into continuity just to be killed off. Major events come out of nowhere, and seem to have been made up out of desperation.  For example, Superboy Prime tries to re-start the universe by flying through Oa at light speed, which makes no sense at all, and there seem to be pages devoted to the most tenuous connections to other series. The whole thing is incredibly contrived and forced, just to fit a plot that seems to have changed during the story.  The worst part is that this isn't even a whole story, given that 52 is still going on, and you need to have read more than 4 other stories to get all of what is going on.  No thanks. 
 Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome negative stars, I would!  Seriously, half way through, I came to Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  Boy was I shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!  I found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  The volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  The plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  The physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  Characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  And so on.  The characters don't even seem like real people.  For example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  How could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  Or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!  The book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.  I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything else by Percy Walker.  
 You can get an idea about the story from other people's reveiws. I can just tell you that this was a disapointing recoomendation from Amazon. You can read this in one sitting as it is very short. The story is basic and very unoriginal. I would bet money that this was the authors classroom assignment. The story flashes back and forward in time to give it a Momento-esque story line, but keeps it realy simple so the average slurpee pusher at 7-11 can follow the story between customers. This book would have been a good product for a community college creative writing class, but as for spending money on it, I wouldn't do it unless you are trying to make the transition from fantasy novels to detective pulp 
 I love his music but this cd is extremely poor quality.  It has a lot of background static.  If you want to hear how he interpreted his music, buy it but you will be disappointed. 
 This can be a much better book if the editors spend some time to proof-read it. I like the way the author present the materials. The examples are good and the explanations are clear. But THERE ARE SO MANY ERRORS which I believe will confuse many students.  Most errors are trivial- wrong sign, wrong font, or wrong symbols. Unless the teacher can help the students to correct the errors, I cannot recommend this book as the text book for EM theory 
 More an attempt to cash in on Rice's genre with far less enjoyment than that which was provided by the graphic novels and movies. Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts 
 When I bought this book, I was so excited to try all the yummy-sounding recipes. Hah! Most of the breads from this book have failed miserably. Sometimes the dough is too wet, sometimes it doesn't rise, sometimes it  rises too much... I have several other bread machine cookbooks which work  consistently, so I know it is the recipes and not my machine or my  technique. Its a pity - some of the recipes sound wonderful, if only they  would work. Don't waste your money on this one 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 The Eternals was compromised partway through because Marvel didn't support Jack Kirby's work on the project, and he was forced to include guest appearances by mainstream superheroes to try to gain some of the dumber readers who were only interested in superheroes beating each other up. Now Marvel wants to cash in on Jack's name by releasing the complete Eternals in hardcover. Don't support Marvel. They are scum 
 I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase.  Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends.  There are even two identical reviews back to back.  This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype 
 Miserable and frustrating. I wasted an entire weekend trying to learn from this book. I seriously think they outsourced the actual coding in the CD, because there are so many ridiculous inconsistencies.  For one thing, the in-book code samples and example(from CD) code samples are completely different. The example code is written in a bizarre style that overuses uses spaces and parentheses in a way not used by the book and generally atypical to American code. There's also a number of devastating errors with both the book AND CD which made this a frustrating learning experience:  - Book code for a basic Windows program has error that causes program to not close properly. (have to ctrl-alt-delete) CD code for this actually works, but it's uncommented and very ugly. - CD code for the entire third chapter does not execute. It compiles, but it doesn't run. - CD code has this dxManager structure that is simply not explained. - Book doesn't tell you that you need to add .lib files until far too late. Sometimes it doesn't tell you what .lib files you need to add at all. - No VC++ 6.0 project/workspace files are provided. This is sheer laziness...it'd take them 10 minutes to add these.  I spent my whole weekend trying to use their base code, then trying to use the DirectX SDK's base code, then experimenting until I finally figured out a way to get their ransom-note HELLO WORLD program to work. I wasted an entire weekend on this. I had to hollow out chapter 4 example 1 code and plug in the chapter 3 example 3 code in to work with it. I've never had this much difficulty coding in my life.  Waste of time, waste of money. Find something else 
  This book is riddled with fallacies and very poorly organized. Although some of the ideas were interesting, it seemed like the author just made everything up! It's amazing that something like this actually got published.   I think this paragraph about the author's "trip" to one of the astral planes speaks for itself.   "Suddenly the figure of the evil Darth Vader came out of the woods... My astral sense of humor was in attendance, as I created a can of spinach, opened it with miniature lightning bolts, and consumed this can of power immediately.   Just like Popeye, my fists grew in size, and I punched Darth Vader right through his helmet..."  How stupid does the author really think we are? This obviously reflects his opinion of the readers of his book.   If you want to expand spiritually, I suggest reading something by Thich Nhat Hanh, or any author that knows what they're writing about.  
 Lemme confess right up front. I stopped watching after 90 minutes, and it only went on that long because I was too exhausted to find the remote.   Bernardo Bertolucci won an Oscar for directing THE LAST EMPEROR, and I don't know anyone who'd deny he deserved it. I won't. That was a fine film in many ways. But let me focus on just two ways. They're minor, but bear with me. Set design and educational value.   Now let us move on to LITTLE BUDDHA. When a Tibetan lama dies, they search for the person into which he was reincarnated and give him the lama job. Okay. I've got nothing against the Buddhists, so let's pretend they're right.   We have a little boy in Seattle who is the reincarnation of Lama Dodje. Well, I saw two other candidates, but there's no suspense in this. The cover has that little blonde boy amongst a bunch of shaved-head monk boys, all in robes. Plus, he gets way too much airtime. I stopped at 90 minutes, but I know he's the guy. There is no suspense.   The parents in Seattle. If I didn't have the dialogue to guide me, I'd never know what emotions they're showing us. They cannot act. But to be fair, in this film, who could? They're an engine to drive the plot, and if there were any way the author could've made the boy an orphan who just appeared in Bhutan one day with no life prior to that, he would've done it. They're that irrelevant.   The story, such as it is, alternates. The boy is obsessed with reading the book these monks gave him. About Siddharta, who we assume he's gonna try to emulate. We see the story, we see his lame life, we see the story, we see his lame life, etc. Finally, at last, eventually, after much stalling, he's in Bhutan. Yay!   The sets were gorgeous. Same as THE LAST EMPEROR. And I assume the director/author (same guy) was trying to teach me something about Tibetan Buddhism which I already know. I studied world religions a long time ago. But, what is he trying to tell me? I don't know. He's barking with all he's got, but I don't know that Timmy fell in the well again. I came away from this knowing it's a "message movie" but with no idea what the message was.   So, we have a movie with no character development, no witty dialogue, no plot, no entertainment value. And I don't get its message, which I assume is its reason for existence. Thus, I can see no reason to watch it. Instead, dig up your battered old copy of THE LAST EMPEROR and watch it again. I wish I could find mine...  
 The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good 
 I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.  
 This was kind of an impulse buy for me and I didn't get what I thought I would get. I thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in TV and the Movies. Instead I got indepth ramblings on actors and directors. If you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler...this is not the mag for you. 
 this book was a major disappointment.  there are very few pages, ugly illustrations, and there should have been more information, such as threading. it is basically a trouble shooting guide for tensions, and it looks very good for that, but "ultimate" it isn't 
 This review is being written by a patient of Whitaker Wellnes Institute, a subscriber, and a customer. Dr. Whitaker has revised most of his books except for this one.  After Tens in print this book is ready for Revision and Expansion.  Buy it used if you must have a copy.  Then wait for the revision 
 I popped the cd into my computer, (entire system at home is set up through my computer, 200 watt speaks etc), but ofcourse i can't play this cd because my cd player on the comp won't recognize it.  The funny thing is that the cd provides with cdplayer.exe which also doesn't work.  So my verdict, stay away from palmpictures 
 I had a chance to look this book over, and don't understand what all the fuss is about. There is nothing new here, from cleaning to menu planning, to relationships that hasn't been said better in other books, or even free online, and this book is double-spaced type throughout, so you go through more pages than you should have to finding this out. I hate it when book publishers waste paper like this.  The most annoying part of the book is the constant (every other day's entry) exhortation to go buy the companion workbook to get all the worksheets. If she had printed it in an 8 1/2 by 11" format, AND included the worksheets as templates, it  would be worth the price new, as it is, in a smaller size, hold off and buy it used 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses: Canon 10-22mm Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version) Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it.   The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too.   You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens. 
 I recieved these for a shower gift on a Saturday, by Monday 1 had already broke, and I mean shatered in the sink, I didn't drop it or anything, but they are very nice looking, just don't expect them to last 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 I just can't find any possible way this could be seen as a good listening experience. It's so relentless in its coarse nature that, on sheer musical terms, it evades satisfaction completely.  Few things. One -- I haven't seen the film. Two -- James Horner is, without doubt, one of my favorite living composers; despite his flaws, I absolutely adore the man and his music. My review is probably somewhat inconsequential, then, because this type of score seems so esoteric anyway; I'm sure most folk who purchase it are likely fans of the film, to a good degree. Within that context, I imagine the score works far better at exuding emotion and ambiance. Without that particular visual, emotional context, the score is just awful -- dissonant, unmelodic, repetitive and grating.  At once, it is impressive that Horner has written such strenuous, dismal  music to underscore Gibson's film. It is uncompromisingly raw. Yet, this sentiment simply doesn't overcome the fact that the material found on the disc, as heard independently, is dire.  Possibly the least melodic Horner score I've heard. Orchestrations are good, and his unique choice of instruments inspired, but there is so little theme. It's the antithesis of fun; it's not beautiful, exciting, or dramatically moving, either -- three characteristics Horner often provides in spades.   Again, I do find it admirable that Horner has wrote such a [seemingly] authentic score that appears to lack emotional manipulation (which he often succumbs to writing for particular films), and his forceful approach marks a strong sense of selflessness. The album, though -- by God it's difficult, especially at an hour long. If you're about to criticize my listening capacity, know that I'm actually a huge fan of some more experimental, discordant film composers out there -- Elliot Goldenthal comes to mind. 'Apocalypto' simply doesn't immerse me, musically, one bit. 
 I was disappointed because there is no game footage, only conversations and instructional footage.  80% of this video is players interacting with Jennie Finch, and 50% of the video is Jenny Finch pitching to major leagers.  
 To be fair there are a few good ideas but by and large - this is not a good book.   In addition - this book's attitude that 2nd time brides really should focus on tiny small weddings that no one will notice.  Bridal Bargains is much better and gives practical information. 
 This book is not what I thought I bought.  I was expecting information useful to left handers.  Instead I found out why society belives left-handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed.  I  enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book.  By the way, it was  written by a right-handed person 
 This is by far the most poorly written book I have ever read. Ever. It reads like someones fragmented thought pattern...if that person had shoveled enough cocaine to kill a horse up their nose. She's the most insecure person in the world, and this book is merely her trying to fill some Freudian void, since she doesn't do drugs anymore and she's too old to sleep with every guy who moves. Seriously, every bad thing that's ever happened to her is simply because she is such a twit. Her desperation is almost understandable, being that she is a middle aged single women in a career path that is only for 18-year olds. She is viciously past her prime and all the surgery in the world won't change that. Maybe she could just take up knitting or something. Models are valuable people in our society, as long as they don't attempt to write or talk, and Janice proves that they really shouldn't 
 I loved Peter Robinson's "Gallow's View." "A Dedicated Man" slipped a bit. Now there's this one, which I didn't even finish. Too much procedure, not enough Banks. Not enough Jenny. The poor wife is nonexistant. That's where the story lies, not with Maggie's Farm. I will try some more Banks, but I don't know if I can keep going if they fail to engage 
 How this book ever made it to print is beyond me. Not one single recipe in it works...not one. It was a monumental waste of money and effort. Disappointing 
 Even though there is no image of this product available, people should be told that it is a Cram 101 textbook OUTLINE and not the entire text like it portrays in the title.  I needed the textbook for a class and according to the info on the web this book was the one I needed.  When it arrived I was very upset to see it was basically a book of definitions and not what was advertised at all.  If that had been disclosed to begin with, it would have saved alot of irritation.  
 today i have not received this book yet.could you inform me when this book would be delivered, please 
 I found "The Forever War" a forever let-down. Considering all the hype and the Hugo and Nebula awards, I would have expected much better.  The main complaint is the irrelevant ending.  We get to know and care about characters, and follow their thorny path along the plot, wonder where they go, and who they will become at the end of the story, and then !BLAM-O!  We get an ending--a sappy, car crash, too pat ending--that had nothing to do with the previous 34 chapters. In business, we would call this fraud; in law, breach of contract.  This slipshod ending is either do to Haldeman's artistic ability, or it is a reflection of his worldview.  It cannot be the first--Haldeman has that rare flair to mix science with narrative, which makes for top notch sci-fi.  (His use of time dilation is a masterstroke) Therefore I think it comes from his worldview, which, like most people of his generation, was hastily generalized by the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's.   To paraphrase Jack London, I got the feeling that his generalizations (like many of his generation) were made between the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon, and he had failed to revise them since then.  So is this a critique of Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers" or a critique of Nam?  I go back and forth with this novel.  It does serve to temper Heinlein's idealism--the "if men were angels" problem--but it also serves to normalize (or at least desensitize) madcap behavior.  In this way, the book is a less funny "Catch-22" or a cosmic "Caine Mutiny."  Of course Heinlein, as a non-combat servicemen, knew how sailors talked and drank and did AHEM, but his book is clearly didactic, while Haldeman's is merely descriptive.  Even so, I felt manipulated.  All the career servicemen were jingoistic warmongers; all the conscripted NCOs were morally pure victims.  And calling some of the aliens "teddy bears" was cheap saccharine.  Additionally, there is the prepubescent glee in transforming Heinlein's juvie into an adult novel--complete with adult situations, adult language, and rampant adultery.  The chapters (especially the earlier ones) were formulaic:  1.	They are given new orders that do not make any sense. 2.	Something goes wrong with the irrational orders. 3.	S.N.A.F.U. 4.	Mandella and a female NCO have AHEM.  The characters had no motivation, just passive shoulder shrugging. In this sense they are not protagonists, just placeholders who use sex as escape.  In turn, the genetically altered post-humans become homosexual, so even that one release is removed.  Unlike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or Galahad, once Mandella becomes chaste, he never became interesting.  "My strength is as the strength of ten/Because my heart is pure."  Even so, Haldeman doe illustrate some important flaws with conscription, casual drug use, casual sex, government solipotence, government deception.  (Keeping in mind that all of these go hand-in-hand). Furthermore, the book may have been helpful in the post-Vietnam era, as a release and a reaffirmation of what just happened.  If it is, then the book looses it's relevancy in the current conflagration. There is no miscommunication and no misunderstanding the terrorists. 
 I hated this book!  It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved.  This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s).  Very disappointing 
 I say this book is so biased I couldn't even finish it. So if you are pro- israel regardless of the truth this book is great for you, if you are seeking the truth don't waste your time on this book.  
 If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD 
 I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so.  I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units.  The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem.  Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.  I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them 
 This is the worst theological book ever written. Schuller is twisting the Scriptures out of proportion in order to steer the church in the direction. This is exactly what has happened since the publication of this book back in 1982. Schuller however, does begin with some good points, such as the issues of sin, salvation, and hell, but he offers the wrong solution. He thinks that if we recognize that we are sinful, then we cannot accept the saving grace that God offers. GIVE ME A BREAK! You would have to be Biblically illiterate and stupid to believe this. Yet this is exactly what Schuller has said in this book. In Schuller's world, the only immoral people are in his words "legalists" (Christians with strong moral convictions). His ministry, closely aligned to the tolerance movement popular in today's culture, has simply told us "Come just as you are. You don't need to change to be here. You don't need to change the way you dress, you don't need to change anything. Come just as you are. These words are included in many of the lyrics of today's Contemporary Christian Music songs. I guess the narrow gate (Matthew 7:13) gets tossed out the window. Is it any wonder why our churches in America today, are not taking sin seriously. Is it any wonder why the Episcopalian church in New Hampshire endorsed an openly homosexual bishop, even though he divorced his wife, and began having sexual relations with another man. Or how about the church in California who ran ads, depicting them as open and tolerant toward homosexuals (December 2004). The Bible clearly says that homosexuality is a sin (Romans 1:26-27). Do these people get it? But then they would say "our God doesn't care about all the moral hang-ups that you people worry about. God is a loving God. My God would never throw me into hell for dressing immodestly or being a homosexual. He loves me and wants the best for me."   "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God. Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (I Corinthians 6:9). Does this remind you of anyone in your church?    I highly reccomend that you read "Hard to Believe" by John F. Macarthur instead of this jumble that the tolerance movement of the 1960s would have been proud of. 
 Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists 
 I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use 
 Good try, but  a lot of grammatical errors and uninspired writing.  I didn't learn anything new about the Browns 
 A totally contrived and badly written book.  I found it hard to believe that this was written be a professional writer.  Based on the television series, which is actually interesting and fun to watch, this book suffers by comparison.  No character development whatsoever, stilted dialogue, stock characters.  Don't bother with this knock-off of Kathy Reich's wonderful series 
 I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting.  After just finishing "Travels" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it.  I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read.  He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship.  Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending.  His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is.  For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences.  Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish.  He should have kept this one to himself 
 It was really cute when I got it.  Two days later, the color started chipping away. The stones started falling off as well. I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it. I do not recommend buying it. 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 The Premise: Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is travelling home on the last flight of the night (the red eye) to Miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is.  Rippner's reason for travel is strictly business. It so happens an assassination is planned on the Secretary of Homeland Security while he stays at Lisa's hotel. Rippner needs Lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the Secretary to stay in a different room. If she doesn't comply, he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him.  Thoughts: This was one of my few experiences with Wes Craven's (Director) work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films I despise. I had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought, and when I finally saw it last night I knew next to nothing of what it was about. From what I vaguely remembered of the previews, and given Craven's reputation, I was honestly expecting Rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire. In hindsite, I think 'Vampire on a Plane' woulda been a much better foundation for a film.  To call this film's premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair. It's unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller. The problem with this film is how it executes those points. A hotel manager? The Secretary of Homeland Security? Give me a break! Make it the Deputy Director of the FBI and the President of the United States and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo. The concept of this film has potential, but how it was staged is just too ridiculous. Are we really to believe that the Secretary of Homeland Security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place. Are we really to believe that the only way this assassination (which involves missles did I tell you? I won't say anymore) can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the Secretary to stay in a different room? And who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed? And why?  The premise isn't only shaky, it's totally gutless. It sickens me that Hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people, situations or beliefs. It forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great Jack Ryan thrillers by Tom Clancy, The Sum of all Fears. In that film, instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by Isreal (which truly is something to fear), they decided to go with Nazi's. Heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are. I digress. My point is simply that Red Eye doesn't even go that far. It has no voice. It doesn't tell us anything, and worse, it's too spineless to put a face on fear.  There are some good things about the film. First and foremost is the cast. While Rachel McAdams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious Miami hotel, that part of her character is more of sidenote and it's a fault of casting more than her acting anyway. Cillian Murphy is very talented, and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next. I still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though. Finally we have the legendary Brian "Better than Anthony Hopkins as Hannible Lector" Cox. He's such a great actor, but in this film he's relegated to the most menial of roles. Almost every scene he's in is him answering the phone, being woken up by the phone, or picking up the morning paper.  The film is ok in it's first two acts, with the second act being the strongest part of the film where Rachel and Cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane. It's here that the tension builds, and the performances really hold the scenes. Then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness. The story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller. Instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type.  The Verdict: Red Eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director. The actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat. If you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network TV thrillers, then you may find some enjoyment your first time through. It's not horrible, but neither is it really good 
 I don't know what film some people have been seeing, but this movie is TERRIBLE!  Poorly scripted, transparent plot, bad acting and ridiculous set design reduced this movie to barely tolerable.  If you look at it as a parody of women-in-prison porn, you'll enjoy it.  A little 
 I am a John Case fan - and I had high hopes for this novel.  I enjoy novels that take the reader to different geographical places, and that is one of the big things that kept me turning the pages.    Unfortunately, a disappointing ending and a main character that kept doing things that would have me close to pulling out my hair force me to not recommend this book to my friends 
 My two year old German Shepherd/Rottweiler mixed dog had his first seizure last December.  After another seizure episode this week, he has now been diagnosed as an "idiomatic" epileptic and will require seizure therapy for the rest of his life.  As an owner of a now "special needs" dog, I have sought out to educate myself regarding his condition.  I came across this book in my search but have found it to be a disappointment.  The author does not solely focus on canine seizures and spends too much time discussing alternative therapies, alternative diets, other medical conditions, etc.  The theme of the book focused more on "bucking" everything my vet has told me (I have every confidence in my vet and the staff at MedVets in Ohio) in favor of alternative therapies, diet, etc.  I was looking for practical information regarding treatment, epileptic drugs, drug reactions, what to expect, etc. but this information was covered (briefly) in a few chapters (Chapter 4, 6, 7, & 10 for a total of 34 pgs).  The remaining 8 chapters (and 120 pgs) were of little benefit as they were devoted to ""Dealing with Loss", "The Doctor-Client Relationship," Normal Canine Structure & Function," Dietary Therapy," "Alternative Therapies," "Additional Health Concerns," etc.  I was slightly hesitant to purchase this book based on the fact that (per the "About the Author" section) Ms. Levin is a RN by education; her medical background is as a registered nurse.  Although she states that she managed an ophthalmic veterinary clinic, but I don't see how running a vet clinic (a business) qualifies her to author a book regarding canine epilepsy.  After purchasing this book, I can see this is the case.  The majority of the book did not provide me any useful information and I will be continuing my research on canine epilepsy elsewhere.  If you are looking for canine epilepsy resources, I would only recommend a cursory review of this book via your local library.  In my opinion, it was not worth the purchase price.   
 As a person who used to see Pat Green in Texas on a regular basis I am very sad to witness this progression everyone talks about.  There are close to 100 bland country singers belting out the "Nashville" sound.  Where songs are written in a cubicle on music row.  Pat Green has morphed into Kenny Chesney with sleeves on his shirt (thank god!).  Lets hope Pat Green takes a trip back to Gruene Hall and gets back in touch with the sound that made him a legend in Texas 
 This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough 
 Based on my personal experience, I have a hard time buying into this persons process. While it was a good read, and Dr. West is a talented writer, I don't believe for one second that DID was experienced by him other than as an interesting writing tool 
 The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation. When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system... press 2 now... EA's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes! I could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem. The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code! I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund. I would never buy another EA product 
 I haven't received it yet and have been trying to email Amazon with no luck, It was sent on 3rd Dec to Australia They promised to deliver by the 22 Dec if I bought before 4th Dec so I don't think I will ever buy a book from Amazon again. No book no revie 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 Pretty flimsy for a Kitchenaid tool.  Plastic construction not sturdy enough to efficiently grate parmesan cheese.  Too much work with this tool 
 The Summoning and The Seige were both enjoyable, but despite a decent first half, the last 200 or so pages of the sorcerer were more or less unreadable.  Shame, because this was otherwise a pretty good series 
 Well . . .Lemme see it wasn't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored, although the opening sex scene with Amber Newman saved it all, the only reason I watch the film over and over and over again, I gave it a whole star just for that scen 
 I purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter who loves Barbie.  It is a simple game, but maybe a little too simple.  She got bored with it really fast.  She played it once and never again.  The board was very flimsy and not made well 
 Watching this movie I could not help but think I had been there before. During the training sequence when Costner's character was squirting Kutcher with water , I thought at any moment he would utter the words "Don't you do it! I got nowhere else to go!" During the bar scene when the boys were betting to see if Kutcher could "seal the deal" with the young lady at the bar I thought I was going to hear the tune "Take my breath away" playing in the back ground. These were just two of many similarities this film had with "Top Gun" and "An Officer and a Gentlemen". Truth be told, the Coast Guard action and Costner's personal battles in this movie were very interesting. It could have been a much better film if they removed Kutcher's love interest from the story. I have no problem with the boy meets girl cliché, but it was really unnecessary in this film. There was no chemistry between Kutcher and his "gal pal" and it did little to move the story along, so what's the point? This romance removed would have trimmed the film by at least a half an hour and made this a much better movie. I'm glad that in the final scene when Kutcher came to see his girl at her job he didn't pick her up in his arms and "take her away from it all" (ala "Officer"). If they stole that, I would have used this DVD as a skeet! I wish that Hollywood would realize that we don't have to have a romance in every picture made!  
 My mother-in-law bought this soundtrack for my son who is 4 years old.  We trusted that since this was a Disney/Pixar movie that the sound track would be appropriate for kids as the movie is geared towards children.  However, there is a song on there by Chingy (who I not heard of until we heard this soundtrack) that is VERY sexualy suggestive.  Here is one verse from the song.   I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine) Lil momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime) The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind) I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked) I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (back) I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal I swooped on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today   I am appalled that such a song would be on this soundtrack.  If your children are older and you don't mind this kind of music I would recommend this CD as the rest of the songs are really good.  However if your children are young and you don't wish for them to be exposed to this type of song I would STRONGLY NOT recommend this CD 
 I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange.  I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar.  This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I used Rachel's text for my students in an undergraduate course in Ethics, and was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Rachels freely promotes his own political views and concerns in a way that severely curtails effective classroom discussion. 
 out of date with the latest versions of Adobe Premiere ver. 5.1 and subsequent versions.  Wait until the book is updated 
 All the reviews from "Customer" from various cities are fake, just false advertising for this very inadequate book. Don't be mislead. Read my real review down below 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 This book is more of an advertisement for Scoblete's other books, his writing buddies other books, and his golden touch craps siminar. This book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control, which is the reason I bought this book. The book is rather a collection of stories. Scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps. It would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up, especially the Captain, the authors ultimate craps hero. I couldn't even finish this book. It was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through, and left the reader with no knowledge gained. If you are interested in a good casino book I recomend something by Avery Cardoza or a book published by his company 
 This book, which was first published 1871 in German, is one of the most important works in the history of economics. In one single book Menger dismissed the labor theory of value to replace it by the theory of marginal utility. Some of his basic concepts had before been expressed by Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1854) and Stanley Jevons (1866), but their views were not widely adopted and Menger did not know their works. Menger's contribution goes far beyond the "Marginal Revolution": In one relatively small volume he developed a complete economic theory, which explains the nature of rent, wages, exchange value and money much more coherently than the classical economics of Smith and Ricardo did. Together with Leon Walras (both of them unaware of each others works) Menger layed the foundations of modern mainstream economics. Menger's work is far more accessible than Walras', also because Menger did nor regard Maths as relevant for economics. Adherents of the Austrian School of economics venerate Menger as the founder of their sect. Like Marx Menger was extremely literate, well versed in Aristotelian logic and able to read German, English, French, Italian, Latin an Old Greek, but his writing style (in German) is by far inferior to that of Marx.  There is one thing, that Marx, Menger and mainstream economics have in common: They mistake their models, which are abstractions of reality, for reality itself. Also Mengers theory, stringent as it otherwise is, has some obvious flaws: Menger can not convincingly explain entrepreneurial profit; he reduces it to a kind of wage, that the entrepreneur receives for organizing production. Menger ardently rejected the method of the contemporaneous German Historical School, but when it comes to explaining the nature of money, he amply uses historical facts in his argument. As he dismisses the notion, that money is based on convention, he gets into difficulty to explain, how worthless little pieces of copper can effectively act as secondary coins. On a close look Menger's whole theory is based on an incomplete axiom: Economy is not driven by people's needs, but by the needs of the people who can afford. Inequality of income distribution is a set fact before people begin to articulate their needs.  Where does this inequality of income distribution stem from? You can not sensibly exclude history from economics, if you want to answer this question. A clear hint to the answer lies in the fact, that serfdom had been abolished in Austria only 24 years before Menger wrote his "Principles". Of cause the former serfs were obliged to make high payments to their former feudal lords to recompense them for their loss - private property is sacred, you know. These recompensation payments were still under way in Menger's times. Though Menger frequently quotes examples of archaic handcraft in Eastern Europe, feudalism is not mentioned with one single word in his "Principles". Was it all by chance that Von Böhm-Bawerk, Von Hayek and Von Mises, the most prominent economists of the Austrian School that followed Menger, were all members of the (former feudal) aristocracy? 
 This is an attractive book: good quality paper and pretty pictures, but there are many other cookbooks that really deliver the goods.  If you think this is a cookbook to spice-up the bedroom, then the answer is "maybe."  If you want to use this to get some good recipes, the answer is "no."  And if you want to buy this to look at the pictures, then the answer is "you can do better."  Don't be fooled by the title - there are other consumer goods that have been sold by sex in the past 
 This was disappointing.  Someone should define light roast or standardize the roasting process. 
 Appalling - I only kept reading because I just couldn't believe it was going to be so bad all the way through! Just a list of complaints about food, hotels, everything he encountered, from London and Cardiff to the Isle of Mull in Scotland. Basically, for him, nothing is as good as America so it would have been better if he'd just stayed home. Also, there are several mistakes, particularly in his use of Welsh. Why didn't he do some proper research? And who needs to know about his medical problems or all the affairs he used to have (because he got bored with his wife early in their marriage). This poor woman was still being dragged around with him to see the few stones he got around to mentioning, all those years later. I read up to the bit about how this ego-on-legs felt he was being used as an instrument of God and that was it - I couldn't stomach any more. (Try Julian Cope's "The Modern Antiquarian" instead if you are interested in standing stones with some legends thrown in. It's a wonderful book written by a truly sensitive and INTERESTED author. 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 Simply more of Susan Estrich's typical left wing non-sense.  This just shows that the pundits, as well as their Democratic masters haven't got even the slightest bit of grounding in reality and are definitely out of touch with most Americans.  Ann Coulter, in all the books and articles she has written, has never once had to retract a single fact due to inaccuracy.  She does here research and does it well.  Miss Estrich will be retracting this dribble for a long time to come.  That is, if there is any honesty left in her 
 I was hoping to find an intelligent critique of evolution and fundamentalist Christianity in here, but was sadly disappointed.   It's not so bad that Deloria does not understand either the scientific method, nor the theory of evolution.  His complete misunderstanding of the aims and tactics of "intelligent design" proponents, and of the reasons various courts dismissed their claims to intellectual integrity is not the most serious flaw in the book.   He invokes strawmen to stand in for both creationists and evolutionary biologists to cover his lack of understanding of both Biblical literalism and scientific orthodoxy could just reflect his inadequcy as a scholar. The real problem is his smug dismissal of these two viewpoints as though he were an expert on them.  The book is a sustained argument from authority in which the author himself claims to be the authority to whom we should all defer.  I confess I quit after three chapters. Deloria has nothing to teach anybody who is really searching after truth. I suppose this book will engage people who like to criticize things that threaten their preconceptions. People who are interested in theology or science should look elsewhere.  He is supposed to be an expert on native American spirituality, but the slipshod attempt at scholarship I found in this volume incline me to be deeply suspicious of any assertions from the pen of Mr. Deloria 
 Tastes just like regular skippy i.e. unnatural texture because it contains PALM OIL 
 someone wrote this review above, i want to second it.  the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing.  i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim.  "From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing. 
 This is a basic PM book with little insight towards growth of your PM skills.  Too much is not covered like SOWs, Activity Charts and such and very little is really touched in depth. Another downside is the Brad story is so simplistic as to be boring.  Pass by 
 The last chapter of this book is informative and interesting on why people prefer certain colors. This information is helpful to know how to choose colors for interior/exterior decorating, art work, and understanding  people. The rest of the book deals with metaphysics and psycho-babble 
 This reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first Dash mystery, because it would have been her last.  Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment.  If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others..... 
 Neiwert tries to be two things at once -- a storyteller as well as an advocate for hate crimes laws -- and the result is a muddled effort. He interweaves the chapters with social science discussions of hate crimes and ongoing news of the trial. In addition, he repeats himself (especially the trial portion), and the book feels padded. The story itself is no more than a long magazine article, and the characterizations of the main two actors are thin. As a courtroom drama, the story lacks suspense. 
 It was an okay read, but most of the information here was on bad treatment of the animals. Not that this isn't important, but I wanted to know more about the things that we are eating. More about the use of sick and diseased animals.  The animals are going to die and the plants aren't pretty (Just drive around Greely, CO) The smell would make most of us very ill, but that is what they do to get the food to us.    I wanted to know about the hormones, chemicals, diseases. She should have covered more of that. Not really worth 20 buck 
 The mirror's light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 If you found yourself persuaded by this book, perhaps you should go back to school for an education in remedial science.  This book is nothing more than a highly selective polemic designed to persuade the reader that the media are not liberal but are in fact conservative.  People who have reviewed this book insist that Boehlert has demonstrated media bias is "constant" or that bias occurs consistantly. They say he uses "facts" to support his contentions. But does Boehlert ever define what constancy is? And do facts alone make a case? Of course not.  Far from actually conducting a broad, sweeping and scientific study of the American media, Boehlert instead picks and chooses examples that he claims demonstrate "conservative" bias. Of course nobody would doubt that examples of conservative media bias exist. I assume what Boehlert claims about the ratio of conservative to liberal guests on Russert's program is true. But so what? Case closed? Hardly.  A few glaring facts nag the intelligent reader throughout this book. How does Boehlert account for the myriad of polls conducted of people in the media showing the vast majority of them to be self-described liberals? He invokes the liberal bogey-man, sure to convince any already liberal reader: corporate America! Yes, the evil corporations are back again, oppressing the reporters with intimidation and the threat of unemployment in an ever dwindling community of possible media outlets for which to work. If you find that line of reasoning convincing, it's no wonder you were persuaded by this book.  Another problem for Boehlert and his ilk are the scientific studies of media bias that have been conducted; the most recent by UCLA. The Groseclose/Milyo study "A Measure of Media Bias" (google it) demonstrates using actual science (as opposed to the selective ignorance of Boehlert and friends) that the media does in fact lean to the left. They define exactly how the study quantifies left/right, how they conducted the study, the outlets they examine, and the conclusions they reach and why. Sure, Fox News is on the right. Yes, the opinion page of the Wall Street Journal is on the right. Yet, the overwhelming majority of media are conclusively on the left.  Liberals claim to love rationality and science, but they run from it like spooked cattle whenever it doesn't line up with their contrived notions of reality- which is exactly what this book is. A contrived notion of reality based on pick-and-choose sampling, designed to convince nobody but rather to act as a reinforcement for the shakey liberal worldview held by the majority of its readers.  [Note to Amazon.com: Stop deleting reviews you don't like!  This is the second time I've had to review this book 
 Anybody who would name Jane Fonda as one of the most important women of the century under any catagory except traitor I would not buy or read any book or article that person wrote

 This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it.  But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3-6 months.  In my case, it was 3 months.  It just doesn't turn on anymore.  I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead.  I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model.  This one has problems.  I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not.  And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days.  
 I didn't expect too much for the price but I was really disappointed with the quality.The cover is very flimsy and the book is larger than I expected. I guess you get what you pay for 
 	My opinion of this book is that it would be better off in the hands of a nine year old.  In a way this book was a bit too juvenile for me.  The hardest word was "hernia".   	The story took place in Moon, Texas, where the roads hadn't been paved yet.  Grandpap becomes ill.  He moves with the Jaynell's family.  Gradpap buys an emerald greed Cadillac.  He teaches Jaynell how to drive.  Grandpap passes away.  They sell the Cadillac.  Not exactly my idea of an interesting book.  This book was very vague.  I couldn't even find the climax.  I would not recommend this book if there were others. 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 I worry this book may cause new directors to develop bad habits. It is  absolutely director cenetered and ignores actors and how to work with them.   For seasoned directors it contains nothing new if you already know how to  mount an intellectually consistent, well-staged production. The approach to  directing in this book takes away all actor creativity, advocating the  director as monarch rather than teacher. Several year ago I saw a  production of Mr. Converse's THE TEMPEST.  It was 4 hours long, featured  added material which was introduced to enforce a strained concept.  The  actors did not seem to understand what they were doing or why.  They were  like square pegs forced into round holes.  And the actor playing Prospero  was simply painful to watch.  The visual imagery was very nice but the show  was terribly over-produced and over-directed...EXACTLY what I would expect  to see from the person who wrote this text. He obviously practices what he  preaches.  If this is the style of directing you advocate, and some do,  this is the book for you.  But to compare it to Viola Spolin is simply  outrageous.  Better to just buy her "A REHEARSAL GUIDE FOR  DIRECTORS" if you like her "IMPROVISATION FOR THE THEATRE."   This book can not touch her sensitivity to directing the performer as  opposed to directing the play

 Book 2 in the 'Monkeewrench' series is, ultimately, disappointing, especially if you're looking for more of Grace and company. Their brief apperances in the book only serve to clue in the otherwise-lost Maagozzi and Rolseth. "Live Bait" suffers from a very unoriginal premise, and, once again, too many characters. At times, it feels like it was written as a standalone story, then the authors decided to squeeze  in the characters from 'Monkeewrench' to try to strengthen it. Unfortunately, even they can't make this book more memorable. The best parts, once again, are Grace's scenes with Magozzi. There's also a promising hint of things to come in book 3, "Dead Run". With any luck, focusing on Grace and the team,  and getting out of Minneapolis for a little while, will give this series the 'reboot' it needs 
 No thermostatic control.  Does not heat uniformly. Pizzelles are dark in some places, light in others.  Is most definitely NOT non-stick...count on the first two batches becoming firmly affixed in every tiny groove, even when oiled well. Have a firm toothbrush handy and lots of patience 
 Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
 This man is on the payroll of Saudi Arabia and by Palestinian Business men who hate Jews and the West. He is the Middle East's puppet. Beware of this mans writing. He is nothing but a shill for the Jihadis. You will find no truth here, only the fifth column. Georgetown University should be ashamed to have this man on staff 
 I loved the movie. That's why I bought the book. The movie is fantastic, the book is disappointing. I will not be reading any other books by Updike. He is verbose, slow to read and wanders of tangents 
 I started to read this book, but then I thought I'd check Amazon and I saw where it was selling for 29 cents.  That convinced me that here was another boob writing about things he didn't know anything about, so I didn't finish reading it.  Now I see that O'Reilly's on some sort of tear up in Vermont about some Judge or something.....boy he can't have much to do....but then I guess he has to feed his ego... 
 I can make fun of this without mercy because everyone involved with the project made a billion dollars.  OK, The person who you thought was your grandfater, is not your grandfather, the holy grail, was not a grail, ?!?, The real Grail was in janitor's closet in England.  I'm not making this up.  Actually no, the real, real Grail, is underneath a tourist attraction in Paris, throw in an albino, and some Catholic priests who attack people other then young boys and presto changeo whammo bammo, you have the Davinci Code ORRR   just call it "Dogma meets JFK" only with more conspiracies.  
 One of the worst books I have ever seen on the topic of time.  Awful editing, annoying style, lack of substance, factual errors, total lack of cohesiveness.  Avoid 
 This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 Where to start?  This is a positively dreadful waste of time and money....I feel sorry for the actors and technicians that had to waste good time  producing such rubbish. The story is slightly stolen from the classic "A Double Life" starring  Ronald Coleman in an Oscar winning role in the 50's.  ITs nothing but a lame slasher movie with the addition of famous leads.  If you were to bet me that a movie 90 minutes in length and  featuring  Elizabeth Hurley in all her stunning beauty for nearly every minute of it..and that I'd still regret wasting  the time I'd take  that bet....I did,  and lost.  Be afraid ,  be very afraid 
 After reading "Excuse me Your Life is Waiting" I ordered the Playbook with high expectations.  While I found the first book to be life transforming, I thought the Playbook was a step backwards.  Too many exercises, too much wallowing in the past.  Where is the excitement and the good feelings of the first book?  I have been trying for about a year to get through this book, but I don't think I ever will.  It just doesn't have the spark of the first book.  I probably would have given this book higher marks before reading the first book, but now it pales in comparison.  If you like to work hard before you get the reward this book might be what you need, but read it before "Excuse Me, Your life is Waiting" 
 Ogden's contention is subtle and a bit obscure. First, he identifies the three soteriological approaches to other religions: exclusivism, inclusivism and pluralism. Second, he proceeds to critique each one in turn. Third, he proceeds to set forth a fourth view, which he does not care to name. More on that later. Exclusivism's assertion that Christianity is the only true religion and that other faiths have absolutely no salvific value is beneath Ogden's contempt.He flatly and forcefully rejects it as incompatible with the biblical evidence for God's goodness and universal salvific will. He also charges it of not being conformed to experience and reason. He concludes that Exclusivism is not "credible to human existence" and an inappropiate representation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Ogden also rejects Inclusivism, both in its "pluralistic" (other religions are paths of salvation, even though they are superseded or fulfilled by the Gospel) and "monistic" (other religions are not salvific: their members can still be saved despite of their beliefs, not because of them) thanks to the mediation of Christ (of which they are not aware). Ogden rejects both Exclusivism and Inclusivism because he cannot stomach the idea that only one religion is true and others automatically false. Does it mean that he accepts and embrace Pluralism, then? By no means. According to him, Pluralism is not the logical and unavoidable outcome of a consistent movement toward other religions, but rather an independent assertion that must stand or fall on its own.  After noting that despite of the similarieties between all religions we cannot conclude that indeed they are saying the same thing about Ultimate Reality (p.61, 64, 66), Ogden argues that Pluralism's claim that there are de facto other salvific religions is unwarranted. His thesis, which he advocates as a viable soteriological view in aternative to the other three, is that THERE COULD BE true religions out there, and that the Cross of Christ simply makes salvation manifest, NOT possible. What he calls "the Christ event" cannot be the cause of salvation because the love of God is. What should we make of this little book, originally a lecture he delivered? Let us proceed in order. First of all,  I was uncomfortable with talk about "true religion". This kind of talk marks a shift from the proper focus on a salvific event (e.g., the Gospel of Jesus Christ; the setting in motion of the Dhamma Wheeel by Buddha; the revelation of God to Moses in the Torah) to its embodiment in space and time. In other words, who cares to argue for the exclusive truthfulnnes of an ENTIRE body of beliefs, customs and practices called "religion"? It makes more sense to argue whether a salvific event is indeed exclusive of others or not. Also, I disagree with his all too quick dismissal of inclusivism and exclusivism and, worse yet, I lament his total disregard for the biblical witness in support of these views. All in all, the book reads well, but because of its "polite condescendence" and lack of clarity in outlining the "fourth" soteriological view (by the way: I wonder how it has been received in the theological community) I do not recommend it to the general public.    
 This brief book spells out some basic concepts involved in drum tuning that might be helpful for those who have little to no experience tuning drums.  However, as an experienced drummer, I found few insights that were helpful.  Most of the tips were common knowledge among the drummers I know, and widely available on internet sites 
 "The Beast in the Jungle" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.  Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly "psychological insight" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.   In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like "precision" and "conciseness"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that "nothing is to happen to him". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, "The Beast in the Jungle" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say "an insipid donkey").  Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as "ridiculous" or "stupid" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as "reassessment of literary figures", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.  "The Beast in the Jungle" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.  Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.  Well, each to his own.. 
 I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The "businesses" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you 
 If you walk into B&N and flip through (not even buy!) the other "well known/recommended" pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what Douglas offers.   If you're lazy/want a quick read, this book is for you. If you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all (which the title and reviews lead you to believe), this is *not* the book for you.  This was a total waste of money! If I had know it was this bad I would have just used my money to buy diapers instead. 
 I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single bonus feature. You can only choose, "play main feature". Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. At least the VHS had closed caption. This DVD is sort of "just watch once and throw it to the garbage can" quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS  
 I adored the Dorsetville series and kept waiting for funny happenings in this new book. It was pretty grim and spooky, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the other books by Valentine. (It looks like it could be a series.)  Exorcisms don't make light summer reading. I guess some could look at it as an adult Harry Potter-like book. The characters piqued some interest, but there was more time devoted to demons than to the characters' stories, I thought. 
 This is a poorly written book with many glaring ommissions 
 The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that 
 Searle seems to have it all worked out. Mountains would exist irrespective of whether we were here or not.. or at least so he argues. But what is a mountain other than a definition? Where do mountans begin and end, how do  we decide what is and what is not a mountain? It is relative! The world may  exist whether we were here or not, but it is man who gives it meaning. In  that sense the world IS a social construction. Searle just doesn't get it 
 The description of the book made me believe that I would learn more about how children develop morals.  The greatest revelation of the psychiatrist author is that character is the foundation of behavior.  There are few novel thoughts stuck somewhere in the lengthy descriptions of his meetings.  I felt at times he focused too much on creating a mood or setting that is best left to fiction 
  Well this is the way it has been ever since after Jay Z's classic album Reasonable Doubt. A bunch of empty fluff lyrics recited over well produced tracks. If you want to dance then this album is cool, but if you want lyrical content go somewhere else. The track "Lucifer" was an exception, dosen't even sound like the same guy responsible for garbage like "Dirt on your Shoulder" wrote that. The track "Threat" was also ok. I'm going to give it two stars;One for the production, and one for the track "Lucifer".   
 Nothing that uses FW400 responds to being plugged into this device, whether is it bus powered or not.  Bloody useles 
 The book contains a large body of information on church music, but it is often accompanied by statements reflecting the writer's personal opinion, unsupported by the material presented. He derives his final conclusion about what "good" worship music is from his subjective evaluation of music history, rather than from objective scriptural exegesis 
 A silly and paranoid book of yet another Christian who fails to understand the theology of his own religion and its connection and spiritual ties with the Hebrew tradition 
 The ideas and teachings in this book are just a regurgitation of easily obtainable information available in any Instructional Design publication at an extremely inflated price.  I don't know what Patricia Smith and Tillman  Ragan think they have here but I should write my own and sell it for a  third of the price 
 While there are many books that provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about our culture, this novel is not one of them. A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central character, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make this the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The book is wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible and Ana Castillo is the lazy man's Sandra Cisneros 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it.  If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite "save your money."  I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices 
 Movie has a lot of cursing, and nudity as well.  I was very disappointed because I thought the reviews made it sound like I could show it to high school students 
 Its a beautifully rendered world.  I saved many screenshots.  But the game gets very boring after a few days.  This game has everything, horses, individual armors, unique weapons, etc.  But what it doesn't have is sustainable fun.  You can sneak around and steal the world blind, but 98% of the things to steal is cheese, apples and clay servingware.  Ok yes, that is what makes up 98% of the items in a RL house, but if Real Life was exciting we wouldn't be playing RPGs.  The little pocket hells that you have to enter are repetitive, and have very little good loot (what it has is heavy and undervalued considering the items come from demons).  ESIII has poorer graphics (cuz its older duh!), but a better story and better NPCs.  The problem is, I don't have an alternative to suggest since Gothic 3 and NWN2 are also disappointing.  At least this still has the unrestricted travel 
 The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table. 
 This book stinks.  If you want to understand Plath, read the "Bell Jar" - it's easier reading and the book is actually fiction yet autobiographical of the summer before her break down.  The prose in this  book is deep and sent chills down my spine.  In her journal she just whines  and over describes the scenery around her 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 The information provided inside this reference book is ok; however many of the phone numbers and web site links are outdated.  I noticed some info was provided with a notation at the bottom that "As of such and such date, this is no longer available" Why even print that info in the first place, if not to just fill in useless space. As a PI, your better off getting usufull info on a PI site.  Just my $.02 worth 
 Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit. I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 While the information and comparisons to his father's climb were insightful and interesting, I was put off by the author's comments on Americans and the spirituality of America. This book was more about Buddism and its practice than a climbing adventure.  The descriptions of Buddhist customs are informative, but this reader did not appreciate the tone which came across in these sections. As both a Jew and an American, I felt like I was being disrespected when I read it 
 Are you kidding me ...this woman doesn't know THING ONE about Islam, and it's frightening she wrote a book and perpetrates herself as a Muslim who has knowledge of her religion. Islam doesn't need reformation. Perhaps some "Muslims" do but not Islam. Like Christianity doesn't need reform, but some "Christian" perspectives and action do.  
 Though the book contained useful information, in my opinion it was a "dry" reading.  Parts of this book were very technical and difficult to follow 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 The content of this book is only common sense steps... and targeted for completely disorganized people. For those using their brain before acting, do not buy this book: you won't find any secret, nor precious tips. But if you're a teen and wonder how to start a consulting business in the future: it could be a good investment. I bought the ebook edition, at least I didn't waste paper... Alan Weiss should learn more Japanese, because the word "sogomi" (at page 8!) doesn't exist. This mistake gives you the level of this book 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 Sadly, James Spader's voice couldn't save "Strange Highways."  The story is a good idea that just went wrong and the writing isn't that good either.  The similes are clich-ish, and bits of vocabulary are dropped into the story which just don't fit.  The protagonist is so slow on the up-take, when faced with repeated evidence of supernatural experiences, that he should've been killed just to end his rampant stupidity. 
 I used to have an Canon Elura 70, which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer didn't work so I decided to replace it with the Elura 100 only to find that Canon had discontinued the Elura line. I really wanted an Elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models. So as a compromise I purchased the ZR 850 which has a 1MP CCD, not a good as the Elura (1.3MP) but better than the other ZR's (.640MP). The video quality wasn't bad but the motor noise was so loud I couldn't believe it. I returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad. This isn't a minor hum in the background I'm talking about, its a full-on whine! I also found the ZR camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing. Luckily I could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned Elura 100 that is much more satisfactory. Its a mystery to me how Canon can produce two markedly different cameras (quality wise) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 THIS ALBUM WAS TOTALLY WHACK. I DIDN'T HEAR ONE GOOD SONG I LIKED AND I PERSONALLY AGREE WIT THE PERSON THAT STATED THAT HER FIRST ALBUM WAS MORE ON POINT WHICH I TWAS. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM NO MATTER HOW BIG OF A THREE SIX MAFIA, OR HYPNOTIZE CAMP FAN YOU ARE, IT AIN'T WORTH IT. IF YOU JUST NEED IT TO COMPLETE YOUR COLLECTION, TRY NAPSTER NAIMINE! AND FOR THE PERSON THAT STATED KOOPSTA KNICCA ONLY HAS 2 ALBUMS? GET REAL MANE. KOOP HAS 4 MAIN STREAM ALBUMS, AND ABOUT 3-5 MORE UNDERGROUND ALBUMS, THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND, THE INEVITABLE, THE K PROJECT, AND UNDERGROUND MUSIC VOLUME ONE ARE JUST TO NAME AFEW. AND THOUGH HE DOESN'T DO MUCH WIT THREE SIX, HE STILL HAS THE HCP LABEL. BUT FOR THIS LA CRAP URR LA CHAT, SAVE YOUR CASH FO SHO 
 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have no problem with reading books in the second person narrative.  However, Keith is borrowing styles too heavily from books like American Psycho, i.e. constant naming of products and Brand names.  The Buddhist element to the story is like a side-note, and when it is discussed between the characters, it's as if Keith felt his readers were ignorant and he'd have to spell it all out, which makes for a condescending and annoying read.  If non-Buddhists are interested in the subject you are writing about, they can investigate for themselves the meaning of Buddhist words and concepts.  Don't underestimate your readers and don't hold their hand throughout the story 
 This movie I think was just plain depressing! Just when you think something good and happy will happen, someone dies, people seperate, bones are broken, so on and so forth. This movie got alot of great reviews, and it was a fun movie, but for people who like complete happy endings, this film is not for you. 
 Sure, the retail price for the four CDs together is $240 so $180 sounds like a good value. Except that Amazon is selling the first three CDs at $30 apiece and the fourth at $41 which only adds up to $131. Why in the world would someone pay an extra $50 just to buy all four at once?  The CDs themselves are great - no problem there. I just think someone in the Amazon marketing division went a little wonky with this pricing and no one has caught it.   Seriously - save yourself some dough. Until the price for all four CDs drops below the cost of buying them separately this is NO bargain 
 If you have to choose between this book and Thin Tastes Better (by the same author), buy Thin Tastes Better. This book, while it has a few recipes, is mostly a retread of the information in the other book.    Two things were particularly annoying: 1) his insistence that you banish foods you have a problem overeating completely from your life, thereby reinforcing the belief that  the food is in control and not you; and 2) constant mentioning by brand name of "diet" foods that have ingredients and additives that are objectionable to many people looking for healthy food. It would have been better to just mention what you should look for in quality healthy diet fare.  Mentioning brand names also makes the book dated when items go out of production and are no longer available.  Borrow from the library to read, or buy used 
 I had bought a copy of Harold Evans "The American Century" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives. 
 I have two words for you... bat droppings. This is definitely the worst $50 I ever spent. It's flimsy, it doesn't go back together, and getting it together took an engineering degree. I wish I had read up on it before buying it. 
 You'll appreciate the information but hate the spiral binding! After a few weeks of use, the book was almost falling apart. I had to remove the binding, 3-hole punch the pages, and put the book in a small binder. Even after going through that effort, the book is still falling apart.  The perforations are so far to the left and the pages are so thin that it is very easy to rip pages as you turn them.  This book was not made with "quick use" in mind.  It's disappointing that an indispensable reference tool was made so poorly.  It's not worth the price they want for it because it's basically disposable.  If you use it consistently, you'll need a new one within two months 
 This is pretty much a commercial for the current "Dark Age". It focuses mostly  on the weaker Superman as featured in the "Justice League" and other recent tales. It skips over much of the classic appearances of Superman over the years in favor of a more so-called "cutting edge" style mostly ignoring the best writers and artists such as Boring, Anderson and Swan. No coverage of classic portrayals such as the radio and movie serials, the live action TV shows and movies. A very sparse account. Since there will be a better version when the new film comes out there is really no reason to buy this. Wait for the new and better book to be published 
 The one star rating is not for the quality of the performance in the DVD, but rather because this is a repackaging of the "Best of Musikladen" Hall & Oates performance.  Nowhere in this DVD does it state where this supposed concert took place, and the cover photo is not of anything contained in the DVD.   If you are a big Hall & Oates fan you probably already have this DVD.  It's been offered twice before with different cover art.  At least in the past both versions stated that it was the Musikladen TV series performances.  I feel ripped off for buying something that I already own, when the package art ??intentionally?? makes no note of details of the show 
 	I thought the author was going to show some consistency in history that males made when their other brain does the thinking for them.   So that way when I read about there errs, I would try to avoid them.  I also was hoping that the author would do great research and use great deduction with his finding...  After all, if you are going to write on such a taboo subject, it usually  requires the author to develop cogent points within its pagers so that others in educated circles would take his writing seriously.   Instead, I got a book that was about the gay black male penis.   The book starts off with a story of how the white male in 5 century were searching for the devil to kill him.  This devil is described as good looking man with a large member, which according the author is a black one.  So as they are looking for this devil with its large black member, they kill several black man in the process.   White woman described how big it was and how the white man was really just jealous of the black penis so they make his into the devil.  As the book goes on, it talks about the perfect American penis.  Which is a story about a gay artist who goes looking for the perfect penis in black gay bars.  I stopped reading it and skipped a couple of pages, read, skipped more but I was unable to find anything of value, like how the male mind works or the depths of the male mind and its body and how they can influence each other.     	You know when I first started reading this book I was hoping to read about the personal errs man of the past made have had and prevent myself from making them.  Instead what I got was garbage, the male penis without his MIND.  To the author, I don't think the value of man is his penis and I know the perfect penis isn't a gay black penis, it come from a great mind with a penis.   And this option isn't coming from a "white" how is afraid but from a educated "male".  
 This Rosle product is made in China, and its quality is very inferior to the German-made utensils.  Rosle is ruining their reputation with these cheaper Chinese-made products.  Too bad that they will prostitute their name and image to make a few more bucks 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 This book provides an acceptable introduction to some of the philosophies which have influenced Western culture from Socrates to Sartre. It provides a brief background of each man and his most influential works, most of which are still available. However, I feel that there is a liberal partiality towards the treatment of each philosopher's work. For example, the entries on most "Christian" philosophers are shorter than that of the skeptics and atheists. The works which dealt with Christianity in general are either tersely handled, or completely ignored. When a theist theory is introduced it is dismantled in an unapologetic manor which will lead a reader who is not well versed in the subject at hand to adopt a similar, and biased, idea. Also, when a skeptical theory is discussed it is shown in a favorable light, or it is glossed over as being something it is not. For example, in the section on Friedrich Nietzsche, the author propounded that Nietzsche did not disapprove of Christianity, but felt that if was in fact an institution which is of value to some individuals. However, in the conclusion of Nietzsche's final work "The Antichrist" he states, ". . I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race. . . that the greatest plague to man has been Christianity...". This author's bias is telling of the theme of the entire book, therefore I do not recommend it as an introduction to the subject 
 Johnson presents seven "edicts" for fixing education - an appropriate choice of words since she offers little/no justification for them. Let's take a look at some of them -  1)No classroom shall have more than 20 students. Sounds so easy, intuitively makes so much sense. Except it doesn't work. Most research supporting smaller classes is based on confounding expenditures with parental socio-economic class. High socio-economic parents both contribute better genes and home environments to their children; they also typically spend more on education (especially for reduced class size). Thus, simplistic analyses conclude (somehow) that reduced class size is "the cure." More sophisticated analyses, demonstrated by Hanushek, Coleman, and others, is that WHEN PARENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE HELD CONSTANT reduced class size contributes very little if anything to improving pupil outcomes.  Other facts suggest the same conclusion, and don't require sophisticated analyses: a)Asian children almost always outscore Americans - despite much larger classes. b)Jewish and Asian children in America score much higher than other groups. c)Thirty years of decreasing class size, etc. has accomplished NOTHING - National Assessment of Educational Progress results for 17-year-olds have been essentially unchanged, as have dropout rates. d)There is more variation in pupil achievement WITHIN SCHOOLS THAN BETWEEN THEM - thus, school factors cannot possibly dominate pupil outcomes.  4)Begin to deflate the bureaucratic bloat. Absolutely correct. However, her methodology is silly - eg. try a week w/o the Supt. and if things are still running smoothly get rid of him/her. Any competent Supt. will create an organization that can survive w/o him/her for a week. The real problem is in middle-management - consultants, coordinators, supervisors for everything under the sun. Get rid of all of them, except perhaps in the largest districts. They simply diffuse responsibility, add costs, and reduce teachers' achievement motivation.  7)Stop the testing frenzy. Cease the accountability testing of licensed teachers. Really - experts on Japanese education success attribute much of it to "high-stakes testing." How else does one evaluate teachers, curricula, etc.?   Reality is that parents are the prime determinants of pupil success. They need to take charge of their children, and stop thinking this role can be delegated. 
 I have say that I am pretty disapointed in the over all production of the DVD. It would never stand up against the David Mallet attention to detail of the "Music and Passion" DVD.  First of all the video is way over saturated thoughout because the concert is not really lite for television at all. At best it's a 4 or 5 camera shoot with no crowd flybys or jib shots. It looks worse if you watch it on an HD monitor. The audio is even worse than the video. It sounds like they took a 2 channel board mix and attempted to peel off a 5.1 surround mix which is not very clean. The audio is very thin with a weak mid-range and a very poor bass mix. I had to crank my sub-woofer all the way up just to hear the bass and it still is not that great. Finally, Barry Manilow in the round is really nothing to watch. I love him and would rather see the band behind him rather then in a pit off stage. He looks alone and the composition of the shots are flat and unbalanced. He also looks uncomfortable because it.  The production numbers are hard to watch and average at best. Dave Koz is big help on "Brooklyn Blues" but hard to see because they never throw a spotlight on him. At least not a good one.   Barry is strong as ever though. I guess I got my 13 dollars worth but given the chance to but this DVD again knowing what I now, I wouldn't buy it.  Sounds like I'm a snob but I'm not. I'm spoiled on HD and have high television standards. Quality sound and video are a must these days.    I hope he teams up with David Mallet again. I'll buy that DVD.  Sorry Barry. This one just doesn't stand up to the others.  S. 
 This book was disappointing.  For starters, if you're cooking healthy recipes you should not be using instant rice, or canned cream-of-whatever soup. And just because you're cooking for children doesn't mean you have to add sugar to vegetables!   There are a few good recipes but borrow from your library first.  I think the early Mollie Katzen cookbooks (Enchanted Broccoli Forest, Moosewood Cookbook) have much healthier recipes 
 My son loved this tent.  He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent.  My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor.  Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent.  The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart.  The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side.  If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time?  Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build.  I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on 
 I am Persian so I know how things should taste...  In every recipe I tried one or more ingredients were missing.  This book only makes me more reliant on long distant calls to mom.  Don't waist your money.  There are many other good books 
 I read with great satisfaction Guterson's "Snow Falling on Cedars" for which he deserved an award... It was good reading and skillfully done... And of course I was interested since I was born in the Northwest and raised there...  When he did refer to sex acts it was done within context..   Next I decided to read the next book, "East of the Mountains", also skillfully written but a bit more sex than the first book...  But, when I borrowed this one from my Public Library, I was distressed at how much of the book was taken up with the sex act, sexual fantasy, several of the main characters engaging in self sex, etc that it was not all that enjoyable... He could have told the story in about half the pages if that had been left out... Nowhere do the reviewers seem to note these pages.  However, Guterson is a good writer of description....  I would not recommend buying this book 
 this is an amazing book. buy it right now. however, i would not recommend the paperback edition. it is binded with very inferior glue; two days after i recieved it, the cover had fallen off, and as i read it (quite quickly i might add, as i could not put it down) the pages were literally falling out one by one. i'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the paperback, but i can assure you that you're going to want to have this book for a while, so just buy the hardcover 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 This is not an audio course for a beginner student, or any student for that matter.  Had I not had Italian lessons in my past, I would have not been able to use these lessons to speak the language.  The initial sounds are clipped so completely that the true word is not audible. I absolutely do NOT recommend this program to anyone interested in learning this beautiful language 
 This is supposed to be the Bible on all things video, but the book falls short in many areas:   - Each successive edition has compressed old material and    added new material to the point where the coverage in    many areas is extremely superficial. Introductory material    has been hacked out.  - Terms are introduced and either not explained at all, or    explained pages later. A good editor should have read this    thing. It reads like it was pasted together.  - If the author broke the book into multiple volumes, the    book would benefit.  I'd suggest one for digital standards,    and one for everything else (interface standards, video    basics, etc.). Then increase the total page count to restore    material trimmed out from previous additions.  - There are way too many useless, redundant pictures. Could have    used one picture along with a table to each resolution 
 This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story.  There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell:  First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring 
 This book does takes America's False Images of Islam (murdering terrorists) and shows how there are not only true, but even more true.  Findley is able to get a few moderate folks to say some nice things.  But what they can't do is say anything nice about democracy, Israel, the Jews, women's rights, etc 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 Even though we in America have peace and a booming economy, Bill Clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him.  A truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray. Before George Bush was  considered the worst president ever by so many, he had fantastic approval  ratings because he earned them.  He also led us through a war and a  recession.  But many would just claim he was the cause for these problems.   Bill Clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and  considers himself to be a wonderful president.  Its a shame he will be  remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace  and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent, moral  Americans 
 This book contains some nice little tidbits of info but it is sorely lacking due to its lack of pictures. The 18 page long list of tool dimensions and weights gives you no real info without pics to show what they're talking about. With only 5 images in the entire book (including the front cover) I feel that 80% of the potential value of the book is missing.  Without pictures, this book is simply an expanded glossary of sculptural terms 
 If Steven Seagal really was under pressure from the Mob to make this and all the other later disastrous films in his career, I suppose he can't be blamed for putting on the pounds and taking on a 'who cares?' attitude. His earlier films have the stamp of well-choregraphed high action, realistic and slickly done. The plots might be pretty predictable, but if you were looking for a good testosterone charged action thriller, Steven Seagal could deliver. There was frequently an ecological message being delivered about how man is ruining the planet, so a spiritual message was often contained in a Seagal film, which was good if subtly given, but a little preachy if not. The main issue here is that Seagal's first movies were some of the best action productions with a spiritual message tagged on somewhere, whereas his latest ones have all been crap. His heart just doesn't seem to be in it any more and it shows. His Buddhist master may have advised him not to make any more violent movies, but it should have been advice not to make any completely crap ones. I'd personally like to see him do one more really good one, even if his role (given that he's older) was adapted accordingly, maybe something along the line of Charles Bronson in The Mechanic as the hitman mentor of Jan Michael Vincent.          
 reads like it was written by an elementary schooler during recess and stereotypes every culture/character it tries to relate to the reader.  insulting to the intelligence of its audience. possibly the most laughable piece of garbage ever put into hard cover.  
 I'd say this book was mediocre and trite. You can judge a book by its cover here- an awful title for an awful read. It is written from a fairly feminist perspective despite the fact that the authors are men. It had a few good points but I could have spent my money in much better ways. A lot of it is stories (Bruce is the fictional 'hero' and Bob is the 'failure' and they keep re-appearing to illustrate the ideas in the book) and the stories are awful. There are  checklists in each chapter ("what to do during the date") and these stories recap what the checklists and ideas say. When one of the stories quoted the checklist verbatim (something like "bruce touched his date on the arm at least once to make physical contact with her blah blah blah") I nearly vomited. At that point I literally threw the book into a fire and made it useful. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
 I bought these JVC headphones as I have a hearing loss and I always get complaints about the TV being too loud.  I bought JVC because I have a JVC sound processor.  My impression of the headphones is that they are not a well-designed unit.    I have experienced two main problems with this headphone/transmitter set.  First, the positioning of the headset in the charger/transmitter has to be perfect or the headset will not charge. And it is very problematic to position the headphones in the charger in exactly the correct manner.  If the headset is not perfectly placed, it will not charge the batteries.  Therefore, intelligent user-friendly engineering of the charge/headset combo is really lacking.  Secondly, the transmitter on my unit will suddenly go off and transmit loud static!  That will wake you up real quick!  The sound may stop transmitting for up to a minute or more, and then it will come back on.  The problem became more frequent so I finally stopped using the headset entirely.  JVC has the WORST customer service center in the entire civilized world, (I have tried to get other JVC items serviced and have had nothing but trouble with them), so I junked the unit.  I bought a Sony headset and so far it works great.    My advice is to avoid this JVC product.   Jim "Konedog" Koeni 
 Maybe this DVD would be good if you know & like the group, "Collective Soul" before you watched it. I didn't, & I found the lead singer to be an annoyingly privileged navel-gazer, so much so, I wanted to tell him to shut up & go back to the USA already. I bought the DVD because I thought I'd get to see some great shots of Morocco on film but, no-ooo, all I saw was that guy crooning away in some pretty ill-chosen spaces. Take this DVD off my hands, please!!!  
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
 I've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c I'm too lazy to buy another one. However, I am at the end of my rope. From Day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time I was vacuuming on hardwood. If I accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb, the belt broke. I took to buying lots of extra belts whenever I went to the store. The other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. I promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute I turned the vacuum on. I say: NO MORE. I am now determined to buy the best vacuum EVER. I don't care how much it costs!! The only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. But that's it. Changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers, I frequently run over the cord. Something just wasn't designed right there... You've been warned 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 I ordered this book for my son because I thought it would be a cute and entertaining story.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was neither cute nor entertaining.  The plot and characters are very shallow and simplistic, although that is not the problem I have with this book.  The problem is the writing style.  It is written in a very colloquial style and has no literary flair whatsoever.  If you are looking for a sweet, funny undersea story to read your young one, look elsewhere.  This one lacks quality and refinement 
 A catchy poppy CD completely void of originality... It's like they thought 'Let's just cut and paste this crap together from the CD's we like, no one will notice.'  Seriously, there's nothing these guys do that we haven't already heard far too many times 
 In a reference book covering virtually every musical to open on Broadway through the 1989 season, Bordman provides opening dates and theatres for each show.   Unfortunately, Bordman comes across as stuffy old professor who doesn't much like his subject matter. He feels the Broadway musical reached its peak with ROSE MARIE (1924), has little use for the advances in book writing made by Oscar Hammerstein, and has a major dislike of Stephen Sondheim. He downplays the major advances in musical theatre made in the 1970s by Hal Prince, Bob Fosse, Michael Bennett, and others.  He also takes an annoying condescending approach to most serious musicals preferring the fun and frivolity of the operettas and musical comedies of the 1920s. Of course the author is entitled to his opinion, but the book would be more useful if he delved more deeply into the reasons why this type of entertainment has changed, instead of just bemoaning the changes.  While it is somewhat useful to have the key data in one volume, the stuffiness or the writing, the lack of insight and the fact that the book is now 15 years out-of-date render it less than essential.   
 I would really like to know the average age of the reviewers who rated this book favorably.  I read 210 pages and finally had to quit. I just couldn't keep reading. The writing is very unimaginative. The authors have a very limited use of vocabulary - the sentences are short and stilted and they often use the same adjectctive or other words repeatedly to describe a scene  or other point of the book.  Once you pick up on this you can't help but notice it over and over throughout the book.  The resemblance to Lord of the Rings is almost laughable. At one point the 'kender' character (which would be the hobbit) says something like "I used to own a magic ring once - have I told you about it?"  Duh!!!  Another thing that is really annoying is the authors constant use of exclamation points. Instead of using clever and sophisticated writing to make a point - the use short sentences punctuated throughout with exclamation points. Again- once you notice it, there is no ignoring it and it becomes more and more irritating. Where were the editors???  Young adults may find this book interesting - which is scary - as for me this shows what poor writing it takes to get someone to claim a book is one of the best they've read.  It will be a long time before I give another Weis/Hickman book a chance. My time is too valuable to waste it on such poor writing 
 This is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film's deeping meaning.  I am sure that I missed much of that meaning.  However, one aspect of it is painful clear.  The crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation.  I found that premise disturbing and unrealistic.  Also, it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex.  If so, this movie could contribute, in a small way, to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof.  Watch this movie if you must, but be critical of its assumptions about male/female relationships.    
 This book was on the bestseller's shelf at my local bookstore.  I asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews.  Shocking.  As a number of other customer's have commented on this site, this book was not worth the money it cost.  It was silly, contrived and unrealistic.    The cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time.  I typically don't read romance novels but I can't begin to imagine that that's possible.  
 I read novels to escape from people like Izzy Spellman, the main character, not to be subjected to 300+ pages of her dysfunctional misadventures. There was nothing to like about her. The storyline contained opportunities to make her seem like a real person--to give her at least a grain of fear, warmth, or love of justice. As readers, we needed some reason to at least feel sorry for her ever if we couldn't bring ourselves to tolerate her.  A better title for this book would be, "The Case of the Missing Plot." The plot (if you want to call it that) doesn't start until you're 1/3 of the way through the entire page count. About half of the scenes in the book border on absurd. The ending is not rewarding in the slightest.  I obviously disliked the book. The only way I could justify the money  I spent on it was to view it as a parody of family dysfunction. If it is viewed as such, it's not half bad. As a mystery, or series of P.I. stories, it might want to indulge in a "Missing Weekend. 
 I picked up this book because I'm always looking for mysteries with an antiques theme. I have been an antiques dealer for many years and also have written a newspaper column on antiques and published newsletters on children's illustrators. I say this because I don't want anyone to think I'm naive in the practices of paper dealers. This doesn't mean I approve of them. The author doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping a cover off and an illustration out of a $10 magazine and then charging $40 each for them, pitching the rest. She doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping apart a book, as long as it's "imperfect," so she can make a BIG profit on the illustrations. She isn't selling prints, artwork created to be framed and displayed. She's destroying publications that other collectors would love to own intact, even if imperfect. Old magazines and books are not a renewable resource for the collector or researcher, and fewer and fewer survive each year because of dealers like her. I know this criticism has nothing to do with her writing, but I will not read a book that promotes such practices and leads the reader to believe it's acceptable. 
 I found useless this book. I returned it 
 war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
 I read this book for a college course on classroom management and diversity and was sorely disappointed.  Payne's advice and comments are based on only her findings (her private publishing company does not have to justify research) and perpetuated the stereotypes she was trying to fight even more. It didn't make me feel more prepared for dealing with impoverished students but made me angry with her.  I would look to other books for advice 
 This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. 
 I love goth, rock, punk and reggae music but this is a load of wannabe rockers trying to be cool and failing quite miserably, i hope that this music doesn't get TO popular otherwise us Goths will have to release loads of albums to get this junk of the charts 
 I bought this book for a readings class this semester.  I don't have a suitable vocabulary to describe how poor it is.  The text is inconsistent and full of errors.  The author blathers on without concluding much.  He references his previous work and that of PhD theses (which I can only assume are his own students).  I question the underlying assumptions of his theory but it is never fleshed out in sufficient detail to be understood and examined.  Some examples:  Page 8, the author discusses history, "there were no exceptions or counterexamples (to Newton's laws) until Einstein advanced the theory of relativity".  Really?  How about Maxwell's equations, the Michelson-Morley experiments, the theory of the ether, Mercury's orbit around the Sun?  Page 18, The author uses matrix algebra notation and operations on nonlinear equations. Superposition does not apply to nonlinear equations.  Example 1-13, consists of a redesign problem where one constraint is "no increase in cost", and the solution to the example problem is to add a component to the existing design.  And that component is free?  Title of one section: "Reduction of uncertainty: Conversion of a design with time-dependent combinatorial complexity to a design with time-dependent periodic complexity".    It goes on.  I made it about 100 pages into it 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 When I ordered Mr Dubal revised "The Art of Piano" I have high expectation  - his second edition is my "piano bible" and I have all his book. So my dissapointment was very big. I have feeling that this is "rushed edition" and Mr Dubal didnt work hard on this revision. Why ?  My big "suprise" was to look back and forward in H when searching for Mrs Angela Hewitt who in my humble opinion is the leading Bach pianist and her complete recording of Sebastian is best avaible. No Hewitt. Also serious book edited in 2004 should notice Piotr Anderszewski activity. Many other pianists that developed major carriers in last decade have very "pale" and not update bio:  Hough, Demidenko Andensen .... Others like Gulda and Zacharias have also small note. I understand that You can't write tottaly objective book and maybe these pianists are not writer favorites but you can't miss their work and progress in last decade !  Why I thing this book is rushed ? Because updates on some major pianists are not visible. For example - Murray Perahia. I found that Mr Dubal didnt notice this wonderful pianist work from 1995. Also, when copying from 2-ed his bad review from Mr Perahia recital, it will be fair to note that the event happened some 10 years ago and maybe is not relevant now. I suppose that Mr Dubal have listened to Perahia recitals/concerts in last decade and I'm sure that He listened to new CD's. No single word about Perahia Bach and wonderful Chopin Etudes. It's also case when speaking about Pollini and others. For example I would like to read about Zimerman new recordings , comparing his Chopin concertos (I personnaly prefer the first version). My dissapointment was great because the writer is real "guru" of piano and his knowledge about piano and pianists is huge and he is wonderful writer. The book is real treasure for person who have not read 2-nd edition but has little to offer for readers familiar with previous editio 
 Ayn Rand's fictional story about "when the engine of the world stopped" is rather poorly written. The philosophical perspective presented in some of the speeches and some of the events in this overly long story is individualism that knows no restraint. I got the feeling while reading this book that there was no such thing as society, no such thing as kindness or compassion. In fact it seemed like compassion and kindness were moral faults to be sneered at. Anyway, the story was second rate at best and kind of horrifying at worst.  Judging the literary quality of a book may be a matter of taste, however I am not alone in considering the book to be poorly written. The specific areas where it is wanting in quality are there: (1) The characters are poorly developed and seem to exist mainly to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. (2) the situations and conversations presented in the story lack credibility. What person have you ever met who launches into a 4 or 5 page philosophical presentation while courting or love making?  (3) the 'bad' characters are 'bad' mostly because they think that social responsibility and compassion matter. Somehow compassion is a vice that the author distorts until it cannot be recognised. Such departures from real life experience that we all share really degrades the story line into parody - again this is done to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. The parody is not intentional it is merely the product of poor composition (4) the story is at time interminably verbose. What could be said in a few lines is stretched out into tedious pages by the author because she had an inadequate ability to write in the English language. Verbosity does not clarify and it does not improve a story line.  I am sure that this book appeals mainly to people in their later teens - before they gained enough life experience and enough good sense to reject the stupidity that the author seems to think is a virtue 
 Well, I was all set to dig into this "new" history of the "war of wars," but something caught my eye early on -- sloppy editing. For instance, on p. 23 we read "The wily Robespierre brilliant exploited their dilemma." As I've often remarked on student papers, "Is that a sentence?" Then, on p. 39, the third paragraph begins, "The Incobins." Obviously the author meant Jacobins, but where was the editor on that one? Sorry, but to slog through another 700+ pages of that kind of editing is troublesome. To the author's credit, he has attempted a monumental task, and it is a book that needs to be written. But when I read (p. 45): "The Jacobins left only their memory -- egalitarianism, revolutionary terror, escalating mass purges -- to inspire future generations of murderous revolutionaries, particularly Communists in Russia, China, Kampuchea, and elsewhere," well, that's when I closed the book and realized that what I had been reading was little more than undisguised polemic. It's probably history as well but there are better books out there 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.    First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.      I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.    I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.    I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.    1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.    2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh! This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.  My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!  My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.  Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.  One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.  I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway. 
 This translation, one of the Barnes and Noble "Classics Editions", is the 1874 English translation by Edward Roth, a Philadelphia school-teacher. In no sense a translation, it is more a parody or retelling of the French original with many embelishments and additions by the author. The editor is Aaron Parett, an English professor from Montana. In an appendix the editor mentions that for furthur reading one might try the complete translation by Walter James Miller, "The Annotated Jules Verne: From the Earth to the Moon" published by Crowell: 1978 and reprinted by Gramercy: 1995. (In reading reviews, make sure the review applies to this ISBN: 07060765197 
 Listening to this CD will give nothing more than a good idea of what is wrong with most rap music today. It is nothing but ignorant rhymes and annoying beats. If you already have this CD, I have found that it makes a good doorstop 
 Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd.  I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what  pretty "vulgar" voice.  If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears.  You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate.  Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america.  The first song I ever heard of hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice.  There will always be a "racist america" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist.  I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile 
 Even though this book is well written, the author made conclusions that were unsupported by the facts. The Constitution of the United States of America specifically states in a number of places that no state or citizen can form another nation without the consent of the Congress, if at all. By concluding that Southern secession was Constitutional, the author loses credibilty. There are other ways to "justify" the secession that led to the Civil War, but the Constitution is not one of them 
 MY 5 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THIS VACUUM THE ONLY PROBLE IT DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGE I CHARGE IT OVER NIGHT AND MAYBE LASTS 15 MIN CAN ANYONE HELP.... 
 While one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles, I couldn't get it to work at all.  I tried it on two different shapes of bottles, but to no avail.  The problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn't slide when it's on the bottle.  When off the bottle, the mechanism works fine.  It appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general.  At least that was my experience.  I found a good $3.00 stopper at Sur la Table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle.  It doesn't have the fancy pour spout, but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne 
 I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.  
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 Although the food quality is decent - and the packages should last for a while, it's a bit deceptive to say that a TOTAL of about 2500 calories is adequate for a person for three days.  Unless you're on a really tight diet.  For a short term like 72 hours simply keep some canned food around (or some MRE's) and you'd do much better.  If you insist on camping (dehydrated) food - simply buy a few of the real meals from this company.  At least you'll be eating enough to keep the stomach rumbles down 
 This film is a bunch of disjointed skits. Thy try too hard to be campy; however with not enough lead and no finish each disjointed sketch just leaves you wanting. There are a few made-up ersatz songs and Jayne Mansfield's accoutrements; aside from those everything else is flat.  There are a few personalities but they never shine: Phyllis Diller (fully clothed) Brian Donlevy (storms the beach) Jayne Mansfield (always points north) The Wild Ones (People Sure Act Strange)  The introductory song was the best part of the film.   A final thought "Love is a rose, but you better not pick it" 
 I hate to say that after listening to every track on this Album I was very quite disappointed. As you'll hear I should say, the band is not near to it's original quality as they were in albums such as speaking in tounges at which point some of their most classic memorable hits were introduced to the world. The music selection was bad, poor writing, and it seemed really out of time so Sadly I regret to say if you like the all time sound of the Talking Heads don't buy this album. You will be quite disappointed and look at it like this: David Byrne left the group less than a year after it's release so the unpleasing change couldn't have been for the better! It was unfortunately this album Naked that dropped the curtains on a fairly cool band popular in my high school year 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 The book suffers from the common pitfalls of many self-published books. The cover looks to be done on Powerpoint - yellow on orange does not work. The diagrams look to be self-drawn or scanned from text books, such that there is background fuzz. The formatting is very amateur. For example, the page header, the text and the footer all run into each other. Other layout choices make it difficult to scan as a reader. It desperately needs the work of an editor to direct the author. One chapter is one and half pages; another might be 30 pages. Half the book is anatomy and physiology. I'm certain the author has many good things to say, but sadly I wasn't unable to follow the discourse. I still don't know what the "lost hyypotheses" are and I made myself read the entire book, hoping for some useful nuggets. An editor would have made a wonderful improvement to a good idea from a well-credentialled and intelligent author 
 Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles, I figured I would see what this book is all about and I must say that I was very disappointed in it, including the tv program that was based on this book. This book reminded me of going to a hospital-based childbirth education class, where it only gives you one side of birth- the medicalinized way or no way at all, with intervention after intervention.  It did not describe at all any of the pain management techniques other than medications, nor did it describe or mention homebirth or birth center options, or even doula support.  If you want to know all the current info out there, this book is definately not the one to get. 
 Ms. Jones continues to lack any spark onstage. Can't her management  persuade somebody like Lyle Lovett to teach her how to connect with her audience and be a performer, because Ms. Jones clearly hasn't a clue about stage presence. I've seen her live and this DVD captures the impersonal, mechanical blandness of her concerts - only her concerts are even less engaging...at least the DVD production folks added whatever production spices they could 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 I've enjoyed other works by this artist, so I purchased "Christmas and Sante Fe" without listening to it first.  What a mistake.  It's what I call motivational music.  It makes me want to do something else 
 That movie was horrible!!!  Nowhere in the reviews did it inform the consumer that it was a film about such hatred!!!!! It should've said something like:  WARNING:  The following movie contains ONE of the most offensive words spoken!!!  And it was used 26 times!!!    This movie offered no redeeming value whatsoever.  I hated it!!! 
 I agree with the people who have said this workbook is a waste of money.  If you own the book, you don't need the workbook.  Enough said 
 I own more than 300 comedy cds.  I am a Jeff Foxworthy fan.  This is unfortunately the worst sounding comedy cd I have ever bought (ever worse that Rock's  Bigger and Blacker).  The sound level goes up and down so at some point you think you are listening to a golf game description and then think you are listening to someone using a megaphone at a protest rally.  This happens track after track and deters from enjoying this cd.  What I don't understand is if I can fix the problem with a little freeware program I found that copies the tracks and normalizes the sound, why can't the producer or warner brothers do it?  And, believe it or not, the cd SKIPS!!!  I suggest you either contact the producer of the cd or Warner Bros. and ask them when the correctly produced version of this cd will be re-released and buy it only then 
 There are very few movies that I haven't finished watching.  This now goes on the short list.  Luckily I didn't rent this one and instead was excited to see it on TiVo, that is until after 30+ minutes in I was hoping a vampire would kill me.  This film while it has an R rating and there is a reason why, even the toned down TV version was extremely graphic, from pulling out someone's tongue, watching a vampires head blow up and catch fire in the sun to blood spray.  There isn't anything wrong with a good horror movie but graphic violence to fill time (so you don't have to have actors say anything) seems a bit of a waste.  The premise of a rag tag bunch of vampire hunters joining forces to defeat evil could have been a great movie.  But, the low budget, director chosen and filming of this movie won't make it a classic on anyone's list.  In addition the movie was WAY OVERACTED.  I don't know if everyone was trying to make the film better or what but the overacting made it to the point that it made the acting look horrible.  It got to the point I no longer cared who won a battle.  As I said this is one of less than a dozen movies I have been looking forward to seeing that I couldn't even finish.    Gets 1 star cause I can't give it less 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 Al Gore is making a good road to tell us the facts on Global Warming , but he is missing the fact that in 3-4 years we will have the New Ice Age coming and Billion of people on Earth will die and he is missing 40-60 % of the cause of the Global Warming. The book is good and bad. We can stop this Global Warming in one month. But we cant' do it untill we will expose the real cause of it. Think about: in one month we can stop it. Each month ( in the next 2 years )we will postpone the truth is just bad. The movie is good and bad. Is bad in 90% and good in 10%. He put enormous work in it , so many government agencies he is using for this ( mostly) But he is missing the main point. He will need to change that in the next movie and this is the main point. As a government employee he will never be able to tell the truth. is going to be all the time wixh wash.... We will need to get this work from this stage and do it under an independent ( no government involvement) study. Adria 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "500 comic book villains" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.   However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 this book is horribly wrong. Really, who wants to read about growing old and dying alone because you hated life and all the people it brought to you. This book is full of regrets and is endlessly tormenting to the reader that your every mistake will kill you in the end and that self-independance is a killer. They make you read this book in high school now and everyone in the free world with the right to education knows that a book they have to MAKE you read is not one that most people would WANT to read. Too bad you cannot make it no stars 
 This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.  
 hard to set up and use. no directions and can't find anything on the web.  Would not buy if I knew this 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 It helps with digestion just like any other multi-digestive vitamin. It didn't really help me output a lot of energy. I didn't get the jitters or anything like that, however I would think twice before purchasing.  
 In 12e, they updated much of the information, tables, case studies, and data (although according to Cateora, the EU still has only 15 members...). I would recommend only for an MBA level class. There are easier textbooks for undergrad level. But I decided to keep Cateora for my class because of the update.   Version 11  I used this book for an MBA course in international marketing. I agree that some of the instructor materials are good. The video series has some good content. Some of the test questions are good, many are irrelevant (testing memorizing numbers vs. understanding concepts), others are ambiguous.  But the book is very hard to read, repetitive, and not well structured. Updates (e.g. Internet) seem to be added somewhat randomly. Economic fundamentals (currencies, international trade) are not well explained. Some of the data tables are very outdated. I spent over 300 hours preparing for a 3-hour credit course, to update the materials. I would recommend looking at alternatives. 
 The original material from The Clear Light Society (www.ClearLightSociety.org) is better. The physical techniques described are accurate (accurately copied), but the origin, background, and validation are not there. Look to the original material 
 I read this book a week ago for a project, and I have to say its one of the most boring books I have ever read.Yes, it is very vivid in its imagery, but expressing how much each thing was and housing advertisements etc reall doesn;t make a 'good' book. The second part was a little better in his description of socialism and how it can not be reached within the community but still found it better than couting sheep. I do appreciate fine literature and am advanced in my reading (Collapse: How societies choose to fail was an excellent book I might add), but found this to be the worst thing since (yes a bad cliche) Gigli came out a couple of years ago. *crazy reviewers rebuttal time 
 I ordered I Love Lucy Seceond Season in August, but as of today HAVE NOT received my merchandise.This item was NOT out stock, so I am confused as to the delay, since all other products I have ordered from Amazon have arrived in a timely manner.Also ordering certain items on Amazon, have been MOST difficult in finding the correct merchandise that I want.  Also I had to return damaged merchandise, and so far have heard NOTHING on my order, refund, or any communication from Amazon.Right now, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in Amazon.Cheryl Henninge 
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 Says it sets atomically to time in Boulder, CO. But it doesn't. Amzaon return policy rips you off on return. Read the fine print. Buyer beware 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.  TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.  I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.  Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0 
 Works with my MacBook Pro 15" with powered devices but was very sad to find out that it does not work with my 2.5 inch firewire external drive which is powered off of the computer. There is a power input (no help in knowing how to work it) on the side of the device. Adding power from a USB port lit up the drive but would not spin it up. I don't know if it is a power issue or an interface issue with the firmware on my external drive. Belkin's site is useless as there is no support info, extremely limited info on the product, and they don't respond to email. I would have rated them even lower but I have to take responsibility for buying it right out of the chute 
 If in reference for gods and goddesses, this is not the most informative book. I would have given it 1 star, but there were some decent illustrations, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. It really reads like a very boring textbook, and doesn't go into too many gods and goddesses. It gives a lot of history about the ideas in celtic dieties, but not too much into specific gods and goddesses. Read at your own risk 
 After reading the reviews of this book here on Amazon, and running across mentions of this book in lots of other places that talk about comics & graphic novels, I was really looking forward to reading it.  But on the whole, I've been very disappointed.  Although the book covers a lot of relevant topics, it does so in a way that seems sloppy and self-congratulatory.  The book could do with a thorough proofreading to catch the numerous typos and other errors, and the author seems more concerned with impressing the reader than in making the topics easy to grasp and apply.  I'm really surprised to find that this isn't a better introduction to the art & craft of visual storytelling 
 I read this in passing at the new San Jose Main Public Library the other day. These coauthors' writing is as harsh as Ann Coulter's but of an opposite persuasion.  However, their use of citations and supporting documentation is lacking.  It is mostly up to the reader to guess which points are supported by which references in the bibliography.  There are no footnotes, just mere page number references.  A great number of references are simply for the sprinklings of quotations used.  The fact, that Alterman and Green are employed by any journal, is chilling and an insult for that employer. Alterman, intending to attack "neocons," uses an example of voter intimidation in places like Baltimore where the "Get out the Vote" advertisments also say "...and take care of your oustanding warrants, overdue rent, etc..."  Another example is one that persuades people to show up at the polls days after election day.  [Incidentally, the book's issues like this are debatably related to the topic of President Bush...] So much for the idea of a "well-informed electorate!" Such voter intimidation is not just sad but almost laughable. First, does anyone want to admit depending on a voter base of individuals who fall for intimidation like this?  This was an insult to liberal causes!  To think this was a great book, you too would probably fall for voter intimidations like these examples given by Alterman and Green. Second, are these guys trying to tell us that a qualification, to be considered a minority, consists of being duped by garbage like this?  What an insult to minorities! Third, if these guys are responsible journalists, can they report on anybody of their own polity that might be doing something about the state of the electorate's information?  While Alterman and Green make this point on their own voter base being so inadequate with any base of knowledge, they are trying to make a point, by begging the question from the first page, that President Bush himself has a very inadequate base of knowledge.  Worse yet, Alterman and Green propose that a bad state of knowledge is further demonstrated by President Bush's tendency to ask "stupid" questions.  Perhaps all readers should reflect on whether it is better to have stupid questions asked than to have stupid results occur when nobody has the courage to ask stupid questions.  And back to the concept of a "well-informed electorate," real education begins with real questions.  It is too bad that Alterman and Green have evidently been too proud to ask any questions, starting with "Why did so and so ask such and such question?" instead of jumping to their conclusions.  Another example of Alterman and Green's points is that President Bush's tendency to leave the "details" to others is a weakness.  It would have been more useful to their point to expound on how this balances one's own core competencies with those of others.  It's an effective corporate strategy.  Maybe journalists know nothing about that.  Alterman and Green's publication is a strike out for journalism. If you are a proponent of progressiveness or of the idea of a "well-informed electorate," this book does not help either of these causes 
 After returning my first L'equip because the blade assembly broke, my second blender showed up after a long wait. Like the first one, it is obnoxiously loud and doesn't do a good job of mixing anything but liquids. It has a hard time with bananas. To me, it sounds like it's broken and I feel like it probably will soon. The RPM meter is just an electrical current meter for the motor, so it doesn't accurately count RPMs--it's just for show. Maybe I got unlucky twice, but otherwise, I can't see what all the 4 stars are about 
 Buy this vacuum is you want to spread dirt around.  Looks like a nice little cleaner but dirt just shoots back at your feet.  Does an okay job on carpet but worthless on bare floors.  I have to go over them many times to pick up anything.  I consider it a complete waste of money and time.  It took a some time to put together so once you find out it's a piece of junk you have to take it all apart and box it up to return it.  For the price I didn't even bother.  Spend a little more money and buy a better machine 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 Slate magazine's little item might not be bad, if somebody else hadn't done it better, years earlier.  Since the 1970s, the Chicago Reader Newspaper has had a column called "The Straight Dope" by Cecil Adams, which provides more accurate information, better writing, & more witty reparte'. The Straight Dope online website has frequently made "PC Magazine"'s list of "Top 101 Websites", & Random House's "Rough Guide To The Internet" lists it as one of the best general information sites on the Web.  Don't settle for this poor copy--go search under Author's Name : "Cecil Adams" in Advanced Search, & buy one of several collection of the better product 
 I am a professional artist, and figure drawing is a favorite subject. I have collected many 'how-to" books on figure drawing over the years, and, therefore, have seen many systems of innovative anatomical figure construction. With that said, I must say that Muscles In Motion is a disappointment. Although there are some quite good individual drawings by the author,Glenn Fabry,the vast majority of the book is drawings from photographs of female bodybuilders in posing or exercise routines. Fabry draws well, but his approach shows little to no insight into the constructive nature of the figure, which I see as the main reason for purchasing a 'how-to" book on this subject in the first place. Also, I find it strange that the author has used, almost exclusively, female bodybuilders as his prime models for this subject. Yes, men and women do have the same basic muscular system, with the skeletal structure accounting for the greater differences. However, in a treatise on the human muscular system in motion, I feel that using a more traditional approach with the male physique as the primary example would be more appropriate for the subject, while using to a lesser degree,female examples to show the similarities.The female form is absolutely beautiful, but using drawings of the female form in its muscular extreme to illustrate muscular motion in general, I find quite atypical for the subject matter.Had I been able to see an excerpt from this book first, I would not have been interested.      
 This album is disgusting. No musical talent.  This people are the farthest thing from musicians.  If you enjoy overproduced music, and a rip off of fellow label mates FOB and P!ATD - buy this.  It is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record.  Shaant can't sing either.  Go back to Buffalo 
 As far as I can tell this thing doesn't work at all.  I have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them.  I should have just replaced the cds 
 I found this book to be glib, disrespectful, and pseudo-historical.  I could not escape the over-riding and simplistic theme that all Native Americans are good, all European invaders are evil.  Ex.  On page 14, Christopher Columbus is referred to as "Chris" Columbus, and is labeled a "Johnny-come-lately".  Ex. On page 22, It is claimed that in 1754, George Washington led a raid that killed a French diplomat, which led to a defeat at Fort Necessity.  Here the author feels it appropriate to quip, "first battle, first defeat", as if to impugn the first great general and president of the United States of America.   If you like your history written by an author who believes that people living in previous generations should have their actions judged using today's ethical standards, than you will be fine with this book.  This style of writing is easy and fashionable. If, however, you are looking for historical facts presented in their appropriate historical context, I believe you will find this book lacking 
 The trailer is very misleading and I was fooled like a lot of other movie  goers, it leads you to belive you are going to get some great special WETA costumes and Characters but that is only the last 5 minutes, yes the story is  ok except the time I went the room was full of young kids and they were having a great time till suddenly one of the main characters dies and the feeling in the whole theatre went from happy to depressed. This is not a good family movie and was not a happy experiance for most of the people especialy the young children. Be aware they will show you cool  charcters on the poster and the dvd box but there is only 6-7 minutes of any of those and to me it was totally misleading and very teen formula with many scene that look like they were just used to attack teeny bompers progamed to fit a certain market, reminded me of the boy band craze thought up by some promo guy at Disney. 
 It's not often that I want the heroine killed off before I am half way through the book but Josie was disgusting and truly in need of psychiatric help.  By the end of the book I was wondering about Cooper's mental health.  No sane person would have put up with her antics.  I love Ms Brockman's writing but this book was difficult to finish.  There was no one to root for except the kids and you had to wonder what would become of them living in that dysfunctional household.  
 While Mrs. Smiley does an excellent job of delving into the psyches of the many characters we find in a college setting, I find that her book lacks any kind of plot. I read about 200 pages and kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did, so I finally just put the book down without finishing it 
 The book only had a few tips and most of the tips aren't very useful.  I think a better purchase would have been the Stacey and Clinton book 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.   Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight!  Follow the teachings of God 
 This book would leave no untrained reader to think Saddam was a good guy or beneficial in anyway for Iraq. The book discusses the former Iraqi president (actually dictator) who killed massive amounts of Iraqi kurds, got hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in an eight year war with Iran that Saddam mostly started and mentions Saddam's takeover of Kuwait. But Saddam is a creep whose bad activities can't be overestimated nor can they can they all be listed and this book doesn't mention how Saddam killed half million Iranians in that war or how much of Iraq went up in flames during that war or how Saddam bombed Tel Aviv with SCUD missiles as part of an attempt to start a whole war with Israel. Missing also is Saddam's second attempt at taking over Kuwait in 1994 plus his misbehavior that caused operation Desert Fox in 1998 plus the fact that Forbes magazine rated Saddam wealthiest man (on earth!) #5 in 1997 at five billion dollars personal fortune and money means power. All this means Saddam was a growing threat when he was taken out in 2003 and it was not just for Iraq but for the sake of much of the rest of the world. The book also fails to mention how Khadafi of Libya quit his own nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam get captured in 2003 by fearing that he (Khadafi) might the next to get captured should he not start behaving himself. An added huge benefit to Saddam falling. 
 I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..  TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.  This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...  I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...  Thanks, hope this helped... 
 While I loved the DVD, it's not worth the money if you are planning on buying the complete first season.  I bought the first season DVD after taping every episode from the TV.  The TV Pilot makes it sound like it was not aired on TV.  It was and I had it on a VHS tape (I threw them away when I bought the DVD's).  If you buy the complete first season, the episode is listed as "Wheel Of Fortune".  .. 
 The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn 
 I could not believe after reading the wonderful reviews on this book, how incredibly bad it was.  It had only a very few of the over 3000 Bible baby names.  If you are trying to find a "new" name from the Bible for your child, look elsewhere 
 Though much of his information is accurate, Nadler makes the crucial error of relying only on wriiten text, ignoring the vast rich oral history of this historic topic. In addition he declares that "half of todays  Orthodox Jews are Mithnagdim", this iserroneous.  "Mithnagdim" literally means "opposed", there is no  longer any substantial oppositionto Chassidism among Orthodox Jews. Though  roughly half are not Chassidim per se, thay include many Sefardim and  others who never opposed Chassidus. Even among Lithuanian Jewry, only a  small percentage actually follow the customs of the revered Gaon of Vilna,  and many of their descendants have now incorporated many Chassidic  teachings and customs 
 Dear Oh Dear... Another paganistic and beastly concoction disguised as spiritual awakening. Obviously influenced by the likes of A A Bailey, H P Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and other Beastly doers of deception. Notice the 666 slightly camouflaged but still blatantly obvious on the front cover? I urge you to read this but to be analytical and on your guard as many of the buzzwords and phrases have alternative meanings. Good people DO NOT be fooled by this ungodly attempt at corrupting the hearts and minds of vulnerable people. May the true God (not some spirit of the earth or a LSD-trip) bless you all 
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 This CD is okay the first few times you listen to it, but it will grate on you by the 5th time. Some of the songs sound hillibilly and twangy, sing about topics that are not of special interest to kids, don't rhyme or are catchy, and don't teach anything 
 ...Go to the restaurants.  When not, don't think this book is really going to cut it.  True, there are a handful of great recipes--those come from the chefs who contributed.  Brooke's recipes are unnecessarily laden with fat in many cases and are kind of bland too. This book did not Re-create the authentic tastes that I miss from my days in Maine--very very disappointing 
 I've read each of John Case's books but this one disappointed me.  It had none of the insightful, suspenseful twists that I have enjoyed in his other books.  And it had no ending, it simply stopped which was to be expected as it really seemed more of a germ of an idea for a story as opposed to being a good story.  I'll read his future books, but I don't recommend this one. 
 Bought this book for my 8 yr. old daughter that loves the stuff made on the PBA channel.  She wasn't quite as impressed w/ the book.  
 Although this book does aim at covering all the options with dealing with the pain of labor, most of the options presented seem ineffective and / or unrealistic -- leaving the only "true" form of pain relief to be  medication, which is my goal to avoid.  Lots of stuffing, no meat 
 This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62!  The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory. 
 Despite the word "Science" appearing about thirty-eight times and the covers depicting spaceships and moonscapes, fans should be aware that Gardner Dozois in on record as defining science fiction as "What I like..."  During his nineteen years as editor of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, he stretched the definiton to the point of being meaningless.  So instead of adventurous tales of heroic astronauts exploring the solar system and positive stories about the promise and wonder of the near future, the reader instead gets bleak and "disquieting" (Dozois favorite word to use in the introductory blubs) literary experimentations that are mostly fantasy or horror, or I-have-no-idea-what-it-is-but-it's-not-science fiction.  Parents should also be aware that shortly before Dozois "stepped down to pursue other interests," Asimov's magazine was banned in a few high school and middle-school school districts for some semi-pornographic stories with inappropriate language.  This anthology contains stories in a similiar vein and of similiar quality.  
 I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not have a visceral reaction to novels and stories I do not like.  As a matter of fact, I have wasted a good chunk of my life reading things that were no good and or not worth reading.  That being said, I actually threw this book across the room.  I have never read such a self-congratulatory piece in all my life.  The smug conceit of the author actually oozes out of every page.  The book made me go and reread some Dostoevsky, just so I could feel better about the world and literature 
 Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?  Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.   One of the worst albums of the decade. 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 The acting was terrible, there was basically no plot. If this movie represents a woman's view of the Conan movie genre, then that's just very sad. Red Sonya was better 
 The greatest album of all time deserves a CORRECT representation of how it was recorded. This is the Soap Opera Digest version. It is obvious to anyone who lived through the sixties and seventies that the author did NOT do his homework. A perfect example: Blackie, Eric's Stratocaster was made from three guitars purchased at Sho-Bud in Nashville, not five as reported by the author. Read Marc Roberty's book and the liner notes to the 20th Anniversary CD set for a better and more accurate account. I wasted my money and tim 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 someone wrote this review above, i want to second it.  the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing.  i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim.  "From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing. 
 I wish I had heard about the versions coming out in 2007 before spending a dime on this one. The picture is no better than before and the sound may actually be worse. I hope this film gets the velvet-glove treatment it deserves. It stands out as one of the greatest science fiction films ever - not a space opera like Star Wars or Trek, or cheesy alien monster-of-the-month gore-fest, but true, brilliant, thought provoking sci-fi. There are all too few films like this one. Treat it with the respect it deserves 
 Much of the material tracing the earlier history of Jerusalem is well written and quite interesting. However, when the author approaches the re-emergence of a strong Jewish presence in Jerusalem all of her previous objectivity goes out the window as she argues that the Jews brutalize the Arabs and that things would be so much better if only the Jewish majority were ruled by the Arab minority.  Her portrait of Jerusalem as a divided and armed camp on p. 419, "Repeatedly ...." is simply false. It is true that the area of Jaffa Road and King George is no longer mixed, but the commercial interaction between Arabs and Jews has simply moved to Talpiot. You also see many clearly identifiable Arabs at the three campuses of the Hebrew University and both Hadassah hospitals. The remaining area of commercial activity in Jerusalem is the food industry where in restaurants, hotels and grocery stores you see Arabs running the kitchens in most restaurants and running a large part of the operations of many of the grocery stores. I see this every day living here in Jerusalem.   The idea that Jews buying properties and moving into Arab neighborhoods constitutes an act of war has its parallels in the history of black people in the old south. It is a view of someone who rejects the idea that Jewish people are equal with any other people. How sad that the author has wasted her talents to present such a view 
 When this book first was about to come out I was waiting with so much excitement only to be diappointed... too orientalist for my tastes.. 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 Such a terrible mis-directed perversion of Mind. Well educated Ignorance. A true weaver of Stalinist theory. What a malignant waste of thought 
 When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation 
 As other reviewers have said, this book is full of cliches and stereotypes.  The childless woman who one day SUDDENLY wakes up and wants kids? Ugh. How tired is that?  And, naturally, she has to be "punished" for not reproducing by getting cancer. Surprise!  The woman whose husband dies and meets the man of her dreams? If your reading taste is at or below Harlequin romances, you'll LOVE this book. Otherwise, stay away 
 I could give 5 stars for the pictures but becouse of a big mistake, stars come down. Okay the photos are good but somewhere I am very dissapointed. On page August 22, where the comments for the picture were about the genocide of Jewish, it was written that Turks did the same thing to Armenians. But that was a lie. Some nummamorous people told this allegation and the writer believes them. This is very sad. If someone writing a book, he/she must be very careful about his/her words. Books must not contain allegations. Or author must tell that it was an allegation, unless it is proved 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 Jennifer Jason...Can someone PUHLeeze tell me why she ALWAYS plays the same role! ANd why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution!The so called ~Bostonish...or upper crust--east coast accent does Not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much WORK.  It as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..Not even to smirk!  Does she have a BOTOX complex..USE YOUR FACE..Including your upper lip... But then again...Maybe she was acting JUST like Dorothy Parker..WHo ahem..happens to be dead..!  ( no disrespect intended..)  Jennifer Beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..WHY didn't she play Parker..I believed her character!  Gwyneth..Love her..!  Bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film..  I cared for one character..And the best part was his bit giving a financial report..I thought that was BRILLIANT..! BRavo..But Mr. Benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..THANK YOU..  WIll someone Please make this film over..And Do it right..!  And don't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..HEY..Lets make a movie..!  Dorothy Parker deserves MUCH MUCH better..I can't EVEN imagine the biting remarks she would print..How about..  'It's all about me..And I hated it..!But the costumes were nice.. 
 This a very basic black boot. I choose these because I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wanted something a bit stylish yet low to the ground to help me avoid trips or falls. If you are into a very basic, minimalist look, these boots are for you. If not, stick with stalletos -- always my first choice 
 PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres.  However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume. The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers.  Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either.  Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard.  There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't.  You can do better, folks 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 I don't know what the editor's at Aspen were thinking when they let this one fly.  Every other Aspen book I read was excellent.  This book is horrible.  It does not explain the black letter law well at all.  It offers vague examples to back up concepts that are never fleshed out in a way to make any sense.  Often the Examples questions are too vague to figure exactly what they are trying to test you on and the explanations will refer to ideas you have never discussed or to opinions in cases that as a beginner you would never have read.  There were some questions that the author assumes you will figure out from reading the actual cases but HE NEVER TELLS YOU TO READ THE ACTUAL CASES and since you dont have the cases you don't know to look into their opinions anyway.  Regardless, a beginner's book like this is supposed to help you understand the letter of the law in a straightforward way, not force you into wrangling with old American (and sometimes English) common law cases to divine what a rule is that you don't know yet.  Also, and this is what really burns me, the authors, of all the people in America who could probably write this book, have the most unclear, obstruse, and indirect writing style.  Anyone who knows how to edit would have noticed this from the start, but Aspen didn't and let it fly.  I have read 5 chapters and I can't recall anything I have learned so far (unlike all the other E&Es I have read.  Aspen, what is wrong with you people?  I am so disgusted right now I can't see myself ever paying for anything from you again.  $40 is bad enough of a rip off for poor students as it is 
 I know it was a memoir and her diary, but it was very anti-climax. I figured there could have been more to the story and it didn't really feel like I was able to "know" her. The whole thing seemed kind of cold and emotionless 
 Bujold is one of the most insightful authors writing today.  I am usually thrilled by her grasp of human nature and the beauty of her writing.  If you want to see her in her true form, buy a book from the Vorkosigan series or the Palladin of Souls group of books.  The Sharing Knife is just not up there.  It was billed as a romantic fantasy book, but it's really just a romance novel.  The fantasy part of it is based around only one idea, not a full, rich world.  The romance story itself is a little frustrating since the female lead was not appealing to me.  Instead of a wonderfully human, flawed but admirable character, she is just flawed.  With all this said, I would not have been so frustrated with this book if I had not read Bujold's other books.  It may well be a star among other books in the romantic fantasy world, but it's not a star for Bujold 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 I had to read this book for a women's psychology class. After finishing it I checked the internet to see what real archaeologists had to say on the topic. It turns out that this book is a (...). It is filled with conclusions that have no basis in archaeological or scientific reality. Many of Gimbutas's assertions have been discredited. Like Von Daniken, Graham Hancock, and other con artists who write about ancient astronauts, the "face" on mars, or the lost continent of Atlantis, this author has written the worst type of parapsychological and pseudohistorical bunk. If she truly wants to promote equality in the world, and not just make a fast buck, writing a bunch of garbage and trying to pass it off as history is not the way to do it 
 This camera/Mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true! I brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies. But I was sadly mistaken... This camera just takes cheap pictures and videos. The only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that I had no need for. After about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better I gave up and sold it on eBay for the same price as I brought it for. It's a great idea... but it just isn't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice. The Mp3 player isn't all that wonderful either. It doesn't work with iTunes. Or easy work with Windows. Hope this helps... I wish I would have read this before I brought this camera 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I think this book is of, literally, only academic interest.  The author's premise:  capitalism will only be "safe" when protected by (Ta Da!!) -- more government regulation!  Only an academic (or a socialist) could come to this conclusion!  The fundamental premise of this book is that the danger to Capitalism is exclusively from "crony" Capitalists.  This is surely tantamount to blaming the victim for the crime.  The authors take tremendous pains to footnote a variety of statements, and then make a totally unsubstantiated claim of price-fixing against modern business by dredging up an ancient Adam Smith quote!  They point to the correlation between market regulations and higher stock valuations, mistaking it for causation.  Not one single time do they even mention the danger posed to capitalism by the MSM, socialist NGO's, lawyers, or the tangle of local, state, and federal regulations.  Only twice do they mention, in passing, the arguments of libertarians.  We are not a politically powerful party, but our opinions on capitalism surely must deserve, at the least, a vigorous rebuttal.  And finally, the recommendations are ad-hoc -- there is no flow of evidence or argument to support them.  Indeed, the conclusions are, in typical academic fashion, sadly naive.  An example is their belief that property taxes are somehow less onerous than income taxes.  This is a position in opposition to the authors' defense of property rights.  Indeed, Texas just passed a law to begin taxing business income because the previous system, based solely on business property, imposed no tax burden on doctors, lawyers, accountants, actors, authors, college professors engaged in sideline businesses, etc.  Little wonder that "old line" businesses were moving overseas or dying out -- they were supporting the parasites, doubly.  The reader is engaged only on the occasions (and by accident?) when the authors reveal insights derived from their experiences with other cultures, or when they review certain lesser-known historical facts.  In conclusion, I was disappointed in this "apology" for capitalism.  To give the authors credit, I would say that it must be very difficult to write a book espousing capitalism and still expect to get or keep tenure at a private, U. S. university, even one with Hayek and Friedman in the pedigree. 
 I can understand the significance of the song and its importance in blah, blah, blah. And yeah, it's a damn good song. But enough from Mr Marcus already. As if "The Old Weird America" / "Invisible Republic" wasn't maddening and embarrassing enough in its excessively flamboyant examination of minutiae, here we have an overblown and haughty trip through a self-absorbed fanship about a song that was written around the same time, pretty much. It's not even like Marcus tries to shed light on a particularly fascinating point in Dylan's career (say, the Christianity experience), but instead chooses such an obviously unoriginal topic, the influence of his sole most popular "hit", that the analysis itself can't be anything but banal.   The entire book, then, contains embarrassing and not-so-subtle acts of masturbatory hero-worship. It also includes some inappropriate passages that, aside from showing just how out-of-touch Marcus is with contemporary cultural goings-on (underground and otherwise), are ridiculously ironic to say the least. Comparing the song "Like a Rolling Stone" in style and substance to the Pet Shop Boys' dance-remix cover version of the Village People's "Go West" should go down in history as one of the more outrageously contemptible displays of arrogance and insipidity ever put to paper. And his comparison goes on for PAGES.  In Greil Marcus' world, the influence and cultural significance of Bob Dylan's having drank a cup of coffee on February 12,1971 could possibly never be measured, and lies second only in socio-political impact to Him having clipped His toenails on June 22, 1965, and having walked His dog on November 2, 1982. But NOTHING could ever compare to His exiting a limousine on January 26, 1990. Now THAT was an event that merits further research.  Yawn 
 I ordered this version after reading reviews of it and Badder Santa, thinking maybe I was getting something more than the movie I'd already seen and loved.  I didn't care for this version.  It is lacking a couple of scenes that I think help to tie the story together, and in apparently seeking a more "noir" theme includes scenes that are probably more than I needed to know...like the van backing over the security guy.  They killed him, okay, I get it.  I also didn't like the ending as much (although I won't give it away for those of you just dying to see it).  I will donate this to the Friends of the Library sale and buy myself a copy of the "vanilla" version 
        Have you ever read a book that has a wildlife shelter, a boy obsessed with natural disasters, a girl that carried a 40-pound seal on her back while rock-climbing, a lost racoon and an arrogant bear? I didn't think so. Well, now here's your chance, with Jackie's Wild Seattle. While Shannon and Cody'd parents are busy in Afganistan working with Docters Without Borders for the whole summer, they have stay with their uncle Neal in Seattle. During their visit, because Uncle Neal volunteers at Jackie's Wild Seattle, a wildlife rescue organization, the two kids get to explore wildlife in a new and closer way, while they help their uncle save animals.         Will Hobbs writes this book in the perspective of Shannon, a 14-year old girl who loves adventures and is a bit more practical then her younger brother, Cody. Cody is 7 years old and loves animals and natural disasters. Uncle Neal is very passionate for animals, and is nice and welcoming to his niece and nephew, but Shannon has some suspicions about him. She will not stop trying to figure out why he is not being open with them.         I really liked this book and I would recommend it to someone who liked animal and adventure novels. Since I am not much of an animal book lover, i didn't like this book as much as some of my friends did, but i enjoyed reading it 
 I have the feeling that Mr. Luciano was running out of ideas with this book.  The only reason to read this book is for the inside accounts from the average players that the author enlists to fill out this book. This book is okay, if you are looking for a quick, light read 
 I should have saved $4 by buying it used. Then I would have expected a cracked CD case. Why is there no quality control for CD cases. It is a shame because the music is fabulous. 
 Unbelievable that a publisher would agree to print this nonsense.  Don't waste your tim 
 Based on the online reviews I purchased this video.  I was dissapointed.  I played it once for my daughter (3 years) and son (12 months).  My son did not last half-way through the video.  My daughter saw it once, sat through the video, but will not watch it again.  Most videos we purchase, my daughter asks for again and again.  Also, the concept of zero was reflected by a bubble, which did not make sense.  
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use.  It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie. I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations.  Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts. I can't believe she's an accomplished writer. Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing. Oh well, her intentions were good 
 My 9 year old has great marks in math, but neither she nor I got much past the first chapter.  The writing is complex and the stories of interest only to those who love number puzzles.  My 13 year old boy was far more interested in this book.  If your child is younger and they aren't fascinated by numerical puzzles, give it a miss 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 This book doesn't exactly have an original premise; a West Point graduate named Philip Dru fights for the rights of the oppressed by overthrowing the American government and implementing a benevolent dictatorship (forgive the oxymoron) so as to correct the problems of society. Such a book, while shocking at first glance, is so common that rarely would I consider it worth reading. This one, however, comes with an interesting catch... it was written by none other than Edward House. The name might not ring a bell for most people, but Colonel Edward M. House was Woodrow Wilson's closest advisor during the first six years of his presidency, and as such this book yields amazing insights into the philosophical and personal character of a man who was one of the most powerful in the nation (and, for a brief period of time, in the world). For that alone it deserves to be read. It suffers, however, from House's own shortcomings as a writer. The prose is pedestrian, the dialogue cliched and trite, the narrative development utterly predictable (and often unrealistic), and the explanations and analysis given to major problems of the day simplistic and absurd. Indeed, it is amazing that a man of Wilson's great intellect and brilliant insights would have ever associated with, much less trusted, someone who could write something so poor. The fact that Wilson was one of our greatest presidents is a wonder, given the content of this book; aside from its historical significance, it has no redeeming value. 
 Merleau-Ponty's work is nothing less than a classic, one of the great works of philosophy in the 20th century. It should go without saying, then, that this work should be made available in an up-to-date and scholarly translation.  	Unfortunately, this is what Routledge has refused to do. Not only does this "new" edition maintain all of the known mistakes and inconsistencies of the original translation (most of which were not corrected when the translation was revised twenty years ago), but it also introduces literally dozens of type-setting errors. In addition to all of the obvious mistakes in punctuation and spelling (e.g., "intelfection" on p. xx; "in a world" instead of "in a word" on p. 129; "deralizes" for "derealizes" on p. 140; "writes" for "writers," p. 163; "Rinswanger" for "Binswanger," note 6, p. 185, and the list goes on and on), you will also encounter such lovely gems as "Bergson's inferiority" (instead of "interiority", p. 67) and "adduction" transformed into "abduction" -- when distinguishing between the two is precisely the point of Merleau-Ponty's discussion (p. 243). In short, an already flawed translation has now been bungled into a bloody mess. If you are reading this book for the first time, you would be well-advised to check the used bookstores for a copy of the earlier edition. If you are trying to use this text with students, lots of luck to you! 	It is also worth mentioning that Routledge has again failed to include a translation of Merleau-Ponty's original table of contents in this edition, so that many English readers are still unaware that he provided a detailed outline of the entire text to guide the reader. A translation by Daniel Guerriere is available in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 10, no. 1 (1979) - although, of course, the page numbers no longer correspond to this "new" edition. 
 Add 2 stars if you don't care that the formulas are in Metastock shorthand, NOT in straightforward mathematical terms.  I'm a programmer, looking for a book with the straight formulas for technical indicators.  Here's what it says on the book, as quoted by amazon: "Simple, intuitive, easy-to-understand, and precisely defined formulas". Sounds great, so I buy it. NOWHERE does it mention that these formulas are in Metastock shorthand, which is NOT decipherable without Metastock, so I returned it. The book is very good at explaining the use of these indicators, but I'm very disappointed in the misleading marketing of the publishers and amazon 
 The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Boring. Boring. Boring. The story is boring. The writing is boring. The characterisation is boring. In a word, the book is a giant bore. I tried reading when it won the Booker. I gave up after three chapters. On seeing some of the comments here, I decided to give Last Orders a second chance. After all, I loved Waterland and if his other books don't come near to matching it, they are readable enough - although I couldn't for the life of me tell you what one of them was about.   Last Orders is told in the first person from the viewpoint of five people. This style of story telling only works if the writing is good enough to give the characters strong enough personalities to be recognisable from their own words. A voice of their own, so to speak. Swift is unable to do this. Without the names of the characters appearing on the chapter headings, it would be difficult to tell who was who. Consequently, I found myself caring little about them and nothing about their journey to Margate. In the hands of a better writer, this may work, but not with Graham Swift. 
 This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions 
 Saddam was a horrible tyrant, there is no doubt about that. But I dont think many Americans have the right to say that. We supported Saddam all through the 8o's even after he gassed his own people. Now, we are waging a war to get rid of him and try him for war crimes. How do we do that? We commit a war crime, aggression, and kill 20,000 iraqi civilians to get rid of him. Funny how we are trying him for a crime he committed in the 80's considering afterwards we supported his regime. 
 If Elmer J. Fudd is ever turned into being grasping, greedy and witless, it will be because Warner Brothers read this book. 
 It was difficult to get into reading this book, since I had just finished reading "Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled, and Independent" by Judy Ford (which I highly recommend over this book).  In my opinion, "Living Alone and Loving It" reads more like the author's autobiography of singleness than it does as a guide to actually "loving it".  It's not as matter-of-fact and loveable as "Single" was.  Barbara Feldon tends to get over-wordy where it isn't necessary, as if she was trying to write the great American novel when she wrote this.  It is nice to read her book and know that you're not alone in your singleness, but this book was almost down-right boring.  
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 I enjoy a lot of exercise and eat well, but I thought I would brush up on my knowledge and remotivate to do more exercise than I already do - I selected this book as the BP concept seemed interesting. I put the book down after about 15 pages - for good. It seemed very apparent to me that the author has some serious mental issues with people who are overweight, and boy, he doesn't let you forget it! I did read that he was overweight himself at one point and he developed low self esteem as a result of this; well, it certainly shows. This book is extremely condescending - if you are an intelligent, positive individual, then this book isn't for you. If you want to be indoctrinated into the "thin is in" mantra, by all means, buy my copy (please!) 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Amazon advertises this book as "hardcover" - but ships paper backs! It is very difficult to get any action taken on mis-advertised books. It would be extremely helpfull if Amazon had an 800 number where we could talk to a real person when the order is filled incorrectly or is listed incorrectly on the web site. 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 This is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old NOT 8-11 as it states. Talk about a waste of money. I returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the Christmas tree this year. It was a shame the description wasn't more accurate, because I was not refunded my expedited shipping costs I paid for this "TOY" Thumbs Dow 
 Not only does this book have mistakes, but it is nothing like a real MCAT.  The form of almost half the questions is totally different.  Additionally, all the passages are either much easier or much harder than an actual MCAT, I thought.  There were also a lot of questions I thought were either questionable or just plain stupid.  I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy 
 Lynne Cheney, wife to Darth Cheney, sells the Dream of America as the greatest nation on the planet. How unfortunate that the deram isn't a reality. We aren't the first in education, health care, freedom of the press, income equality, or wealth. No we are number one in  debt, co2 emissions, and prisoners. Alot of this can be lain directly at the feet of her husband and his sock puppet George. But I guess the whole family makes money by selling the lies of American Exceptionalism to the masses, while supporting outsourcing, imperialistic wars, and income redistriution to the richest 1%. A more honest patriotic primer whould have been - don't learn, don't questions, consume, join the army, and die for Halliburton.  
 A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks 
 I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book.  It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me 
 It never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months. Don't buy, you've been warned 
 This is NOT a new Star Trek novel: it is merely a compilation of two previously released ST novels, Sarek, and Spock's World. My one star rating reflects my annoyance at having to return what I thought was a new novel when I purchased it. The rating is not a commentary on either of the novels included in this compilation, both of which I thought were quite good 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 This book is entirely misleading. Paul Johnson employs one of the dirtiest tricks known to humanity and very common in the political world - he picks a triple handful of intellectuals he doesn't like or disagrees with and digs up the darkest or absurdest material about them he can find.  I would have been a bit more impressed if he had chosen intellects or historical figures he revered and subjected them to the same dirty treatment.  Where are Mr. Johnson's favorite writers, popes, theologians, political philosophers and what all.  But it still would've been a mugs game and not worth much more beyond entertainment value except, perhaps, to affirm what all mature readers ought to know by now - we are all sinners.  Big deal.  Welcome to the real world, folks. Mr. Johnson does a singular disservice by his idiosyncratic use of the word "intellectual" by which he can push forward his smear campagain against intellectuals whose ideas bother him and white wash intellectuals he approves of. His treatment of Evelyn Waugh is absurd.  Mr. Waugh, contra Mr. Johnson, was most definitely an intellectual and he had his own ideas about how the world should be run.  Mr. Johnson does not take seriously Waugh's roster of sins which include an almost overbearing arrogance, the basic innability to admit when he was wrong, discourteousy to friend and foe alike, and a callous and ostentatious flaunting of wealth which would have won him the censure of the writer of the Epistle of James. I'll give Mr. Johnson's tabloid journalism two stars instead of one because it does have its entertainment value. Mere entertainment always has charm especially when wisdom is lacking 
 ...I bought this book to make plans for a trip to Zambia but the chapter about this country is only 40 pages long, both verbose and superficial.  Don't get fooled by the "Adventuring" in the title, unless your idea of adventure is to hop by plane from lodge to lodge at $200 or $300 a night.  More importantly, except for the park entrance fees, this book doesn't list any price at all (I got them from two other, excellent, travel guides).  Comments on cheaper accomodations are few and disenchanted.  The maps are equally few and over-simplified (the roads don't even appear!...)  Finally, I looked at the chapters about the other countries and it certainly didn't change my opinion about this book.  Note also that the date of the last edition (October 97) makes it relatively outdated 
 Gilbert Hernandez, who certainly is not without some talent, became ever more lazy with his artwork as Love and Rockets progressed, perhaps realizing that it was impossible to compete with the visual brilliance of his brother. He seemingly tried to compensate by becoming more "writerly" with his little fictions, and ended up creating in Poison River and some other later works just the sort of stilted, derivative hash one would expect of a half-educated adolescent with an interest in puck rock and comic books. It is sad to see his talent go mostly to waste; he could have been a decent middleweight cover designer or children's book illustrator if he hadn't imagined that he could write 
 Also known as `Dawg," "Bad Boy" stars Denis Leary as Doug, lifelong womanizer whose grandmother left him one million dollars on one condition that Doug visit a series of his ex-lovers and convince them he was really sorry for what he had done to them. Anna (Elizabeth Hurley) beautiful attorney has to accompany him around the West Coast to ensure that Doug does not cheat.  This kind of film is made for fun, and I know we don't have to take its contrived premise seriously. All you see is Doug learning a lesson through a journey after a string of humiliating experiences by the hand of those whom he had humiliated before. `Bad Boy' tries to be funny and sentimental at the same time and fails terribly in both.   OK, we know this guy needs punishment and he certainly deserves it. But to turn his punishment into light-hearted entertainment the film requires better skills than pitting Denis Leary against a loopy lady living with dozens of cats, sex-starved actress and `wild' nightclub dancer Eric/a. All these episodes are very unfunny making off-beat `Broken Flowers' (which I didn't like) look like a hilarious comic masterpiece.  The film's `surprise' ending doesn't mean anything because we have lost interest in the story long before which is plain bad writing. Leary is a good actor and even in this mess you can see his talent which is sadly wasted, and beautiful Hurley is as wooden as ever. 
 I got this pen after we did a case study for this product in our class. I was all excited when the product arrived, but it would not even charge when I plugged it in. I just shelved all plans to digitize my writing, I will stick to my good old scanner for now 
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
 The book is a complete waste of money from every aspect. If you are a serious martial artist or a coach, I'd recommend books by Loren Christensen, especially "Fighter's Fact Book". If you don't have a serious martial arts background, I'd highly recommend "Common Sense Self-Defense" by David Garcia and Steward Smith 
 I was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 Hunter must be in some need of serious funds these days --- maybe he wants to fill his swimming pool with ether instead of water. I've bought and enjoyed many a book by this pig f%$!er, but this will be the last.  The text is too large, the story too short and boring.   "Buy a ticket, take the ride" --- whatever, man.  He's not had any growth as an author since the 70s.  I guess antiques have their place in the world 
 Poorly written, you could insert any other adventure hero's name and  it could be that novel. Personally I used my copy to help me fall asleep a day before some surgery I was worried about.  If we are lucky DC won't contract with this guy again as all of his adaptations are pretty much hollow echoes of seventy adventure novels with very little of the wierd spark that vertigo comics became known for.  If you have to read everything Constantine, then check this book out at a library or read ir in the bookstore but for the love of all that is holy don't buy it or your hellblazer collection will be tainted.  Personally the only reason I could see to buy this book is insomnia, preparation for suicide, masochism or membership in the authors family.  PS The geography was iffy, and the basic impression of the book was that the author was given a name, a title and otherwise knew almost nothing of the main character other than the movie screen play when he wrote this novel 
 I read the reviews before buying this book and understood some of the objections others had.  Having DID, I bought this book with the soul purpose of finding out the process and struggles Oxnam went through in his healing.  I was extremely disappointed. His constant reference about how he spent two years in exhausting therapy sessions three times a week sent a resounding message about his financial status. Most people in therapy can hardly afford to go once a week.  His need to be special and exceptional was evident by his comment that "MPD" was "extremely rare".  This showed a lack of knowledge of Oxnam and his threapist.  The percent of children traumatized before the age of five is staggering.  Current understanding leads experts to believe that DID is more common than they used to think it was.  Oxnam's constant name dropping and many pages of his accomplishments through out the book was boring and served no purpose.  His insistance in calling the disorder MPD instead of DID was an indicator that he was operating from outdated resources and knowledge.  There is a reason the disorder was changed from MPD to DID and in 1990 when Oxnam was diagnosed, the disorder was called DID.  There is a difference in threaputic approaches between MPD and DID.  This insistance by Oxnam and his threapist put doubts on the validity of treatment.  Anyone who has studied DID and has gone through therapy for DID with an experienced therapist will detect that Oxnam's therapist was not experienced in treating DID.  I was left wondering why the therapist did and said what he did. Oxnam's extreme foul language in the book was not congruent with his constant mentioning of his superior intellect.  Upon finishing the book, I still remained uninformed about what Oxnam's real internal struggles were and extremely frustrated over Dr. Smith's methods. The many pages of Dr. Smith's explanation of DID at the end of the book is a futile attempt to convince the reader that he is an expert which he clearly was not at the time he worked with Oxnam for seven years.  In short, the book is about a very spoiled, weatlthy man's frustration over having DID and his insistance that he be pampered through the whole processes. I actually felt sorry for Oxnam that his therapist strung him along, but with Oxnam's constant references to his wealth, vast intellegence and status in life, I didn't feel too sorry. I will donate this book to the library book sale which will sell for 50 cents which is still over priced.   If you really want to read and understand DID, read Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book.  It still remains the bible of DID for those who really truly suffer from its effects.   
 The chapter on General Sherman was great - but then he was one of my ancestors and I could be biased. The chapters are acollection of essays and do vary considerably.  The other chapters were almost all were flawed because Hanson's polemic is based on much better understanding of the Classics and, to some degree, the West than the contemporary world or Islam. Sometimes this is clear because either the reasoning or overly broad conclusions are visible to a careful reader. Other times the neo Con bias informs the selection and presentation more subtly.  Overall more pompous than profound 
 Why such a book needs to be written in the first place? What is it's social redeeming feature and how does it benefit the racial problems we have in this country?  Of course the Roots of this book go much deeper, it's the USA version of the "Out of Africa "books. Those books insist that the Greeks, and others, stole the art, religion, philosophy, science and literature from Africa, apperently the Greeks were unable to come up with anything new without consulting with Africans first(of course we never find out which Africans).  Now we are told that White Americans are ripping of Black Culture, that we want everything that is black; and that, Heaven forbid) that white Churches have even stolen Gospel songs.  What this book reflects is cultural arrogance and gross ignorance. If anything, the Hip Hop, gang signs, sexualizing of black men or women and the worshipping of athletes show a distinct lack of culture. Of course the trend is to blame Whitey for both pushing and stealing from this culture; therefore absolving Black Americans from any responsibility for social degeneration.  It might be more historically correct that Afro-Americans have been using and misusing European culture for the past 400 yrs. Besides, where and from whom, did the slaves learn the religion, songs and music to develop the Gospel Songs; I doubt that they brought them over from Africa 
 As another reviewer put it, this book was a chore to read. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I hate to not finish a book. The characters are so poorly drawn that it's impossible to care about any of them. They're also unlikeable for the most part. Others have commented on how Rachel continues to be drawn to Hank in spite of the fact that he's so mean and misogynistic. That's true, but I also can't see what Hank sees in Rachel -- I can't see the appeal. The dialog was completely unbelievable, and the story dragged. In all, a waste of time. In the end I dropped it in the trash, which I never do because I love books. I just wanted to protect other innocents from this drivel 
 This is kind of a boring and dry book.  It mostly talked about the Desilu Studios and how it evolved over the years.  I was hoping for more about Desi and Lucy as a couple and their ups and downs in their relationship, but I guess that's in Lucy's Book "Love, Lucy" (which I plan to read next).  I would recommend this book for Lucy fans as part of their collection, but if you're like me and want the real "scoop" about people and their lives, steer clear or be prepared to be skimming over some pages. 
 I'm a fan of Dave Ramsey, but was disappointed in this item. It should have been included as a "freebie" with the purchase of one of his books.  The envelope/checkbook holder appears to be vinyl, pretty cheap looking. There are not enough envelopes and the coin case is too small and such a thin material it's  a waste.  You can do the same set up with your existing checkbook and some plain envelopes.  Save your money 
 Alright, the first two stories are interesting, hence the deuce dropped for the stars. However this is not suburbia, this is hacked up dreck that manages to be under and overdone contemporary malarkey. To wit:  Kids don't fantasize about Barbie and then masturbate in Ken's head three times...parents don't send their kids to Florida and all the sudden start smoking crack...pedophiles do not try to fill the void of a rolling stone father and get angry when the captive doesn't play son...and 'Chunky in Heat' satisfying herself, completely naked, in the backyard as her lover, the neighbor child, wonders around in the back calling for her and her mother comes home and just asks her to help bring in the groceries....see, I just saved you from having to read this abomination of taste and decency, this abortion of good writing and an engaging story. You can do me a favor by clicking the "this review was not helpful" button....idiot.  Oh, and I'm sure there are exceptions, and this stuff does happen, but Homes never explicitly states that what she is writing about is autobiographical. 
 I read this book for a class at the fictitious "Grove School" as described by Robert Bingham in his text "Lightning on the Sun."  I am confident in saying that it is only good as a conversation starter with stupid people.  In any event, please avoid this book and all other such literature.  Huzzah 
 Whittaker Chambers wrote in his book WITNESS that liberals are/were incapable of ever effectively fighting Communism because they did not see anything in Communism that was antithetical to their own beliefs. In short, Liberals are Communists and Communists are Liberals.  Ellen Schecter's MANY ARE THE CRIMES is simply one more in an appalling decades long list of such proofs of this assertion.  Schecter is aware of the horrors of Communism; the tortures, the Gulags, the over 100 million persons done to death. She is even aware that the American Communists were taking their orders from Moscow and were attempting to impose the Red Utopia upon the United States. If successful, this would have led to millions tortured, enslaved, starved and murdered. It would have led to the death of human freedom for untold years. As the US was the bulwarked of freedom and Democracy, it's communization would have turned the entire world into an abatoir.  Shecter knows all of this and the knowledge means nothing. The Communists were victims. The Anti Communists were Evil villains.  Murdered millions mean nothing. The Soviet Archives mean nothing. The testimony of persons who were actually there are to be dismissed.  One is hard pressed to see the difference between someone who denys that the Holocaust happened and your average Liberal. Both are abettors of genocide. Make no mistake. Schecter's book IS important. Once more Chambers has been shown to have been telling the truth. MANY ARE THE CRIMES is proof 
 I recorded this from TV, and tried to watch it.  I even tried to just watch a little each day, to see if there was anything remotely funny in it. I finally gave up yesterday, and erased it. I actually felt sorry for Peter O'Toole, that he had to do the unfunny things he had to do in this movie. Life is too short to sit through this thing. Amazing that some people think it's great. Unbearably bad 
 I ordered the book new.  It arrived with dented/chipped corners and a slightly torn spine on hardcover. I assumed it was new but slightly damaged from storage or shipping.  Three weeks into the college term I am discovering highlighting already in the book. I feel ripped off 
 I bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding, I find it dificult to follow. Yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down! 
 I have a slightly older copy and I have found that for the PE exam this is a good reference however, if you are doing something in the real world, the Machinery's Handbook is FAR better.  This book gives good overviews of a huge variety of topics that any Mech Engr might need but not much depth.  It is about as much information as a manager might want to know 
 Len Sweet usually writes more with more passion and intelligence that he evidences in this book. Snipets of insight into an eclectic alphabetized list of topics result in a whole lot of next to nothing.  BUT Sweet et al still have a few fascinating things to say -- just not many 
 Peggy helped see the revolution through.  What she didn't tell us it was a revolution of the rich versus the poor and middle class.  Peggy and Ronnie should feel great in the fact that "the revolution" makes it so we either don't have health care or have terrible health care, but still have to pay high premiums for service which should be available to everyone.  That "the revolution" put many people out on the street and "the revolution" led to uncalled numerous deaths worldwide to benefit the wealthy.  May they rot in hell 
 This didn't work for me as a political thriller - too much was known too soon.  Also, the formula for this category is that pulling on one thread slowly causes a larger fabric to unravel.  However, here the situation is that one person in the middle of one set of misdeeds happens to be aware of a set of misdeeds only tenuously connected to the first.  Additional historical background for non-Brits: A important reference that will be missed by many viewers:  In a conversation with the detective, the RUC commander cites the Birmingham pub bombings as a justification for extralegal means such as torture.  At the time this movie was made, it had been proven in two related cases (the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven) that the police had obtained false confessions by torture, had manufactured and misrepresented evidence, and had surpressed crucial evidence, including information about the actual terrorists.  There was extensive evidence that the Birmingham Six were similarly innocent (with the exception that the identity of the actual bombers was unknown).  Lord Denning, a judge on an aspect of this case, rejected stong physical and testimonial evidence of torture under the reasoning that it was unthinkable that the police would do such.  Aside: US courts use legal technicalities to block such evidence (e.g., that no matter how much evidence the prosecution suppressed and manufactured, it wouldn't have changed the verdict in the original trial) 
 I just bought this book and I have to be honest that it really disappointed me. All the material inside is already known and has been explained from some other book like "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku. The book just repeats some fact about kaluza-klein, flatlanders, mobius strip, supergravity or relativity theory of Einstein. It does not even consider explaining in detail the latest advancement in theoretical physics that explore the possibility of higher dimension or theory of everything as its title would suggest.   If you are looking for some introduction to popular science of space-time, matter and the universe in general, MAYBE this book will be suitable for you (even though I would advice you to get it from another book such as "Hyperspace" or "Parallel Worlds" by Michio Kaku). But if you are looking for some "advance" information in these area or the latest advancement in theoretical physics concerning the development of the Superstring, M-Theory, Brane Worlds and so on, this book is definitely NOT for you. 
    I guess with all the news recently that Universal wants to buy Dreamworks, their DVD marketing has started to go down the toilet, as two film packs like this one useually show little effort in both making a good DVD,adding any good bones features, and then just rushing it to stores.  The two movies on this gift set are rushed DVDs that were fast put together and were ment to rob you of your money.    Jurassic Park III; Perhaps the worst movie that Universal has done in ten years.  All special effects and no story.  Sam Neill deserves better films then this, and they still want to do a Jurassic Park IV......?!    Hulk;  Good Movie, bad DVD release and transfer.  Marvel did not like it either, nor Universal's less then promotion of the movie when it was about to be released to theaters.  There's talk of Marvel taking the Hulk Movie franchise to another movie company once the righst with Universal expire.  I say "Yes, Take it to a movie company that will do it right 
 My wife and I have used this machine for several weeks now. We found it to be a great machine for the price. Others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands, so I immediately machined  an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other American Vacuums. Now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on. This thing is lite, strong, and easy to empty. The cord retractor is a little lite so I wouldn't be to rough with it.

 Okay, so the Jaci Velazquez worshipers out there will want to kill me for this, but I don't think I've ever heard such an awful Christmas CD as this one.  I bought it as a gift for my wife, who adores Jaci, and my wife wanted to throw it away after listening to it.  This album goes to prove that just because someone has a good voice and strong talent, that person can't necessarily sing effectively in other styles, such as jazz, crooning, etc.  There are a few gems here (hence the second star) such as tracks 1, 2, and 11, and tracks 3, 4, and 5 are decent, but there are also some awful songs.  Her version of "Let It Snow. . ." is truly painful to listen to, and the remake of "The Chipmunk Song" is pathetic at best.  I love Jaci's contemporary stuff, but she's out of her element here, trying to pull off what Amy Grant did with her second Christmas album, and it simply doesn't work 
 After reading this book's predecessor, "Travelers' Tales:  Food," I had been eagerly waiting for the next volume of stories.  This book falls far short of the standard set in "Food."  None of  the stories are particularly memorable, enlightening or even entertaining.   Many have little to do with travel experiences.  While I really love the  Travelers' Tales books in general, this one was truly dissapointing 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 This book is a work of fiction.The list of errorsis too great to warrant a non-fiction label.The author makes the case that Molinas is a habitual liar.So,why would Rosen print Molinas comments in interviews other sports writers had with him without corroboration.There is no doubt that Molinas was an unusual character with huge talents who preferred to break all the rules,making him a tragic figure.It is hard to enjoy this read,because there is no way to discern truth from fantasy.I think Molinas had the last laugh with his creative tales to writers.He figured they would accept his stories as the gospel...Bob Reis 
 This book was very disappointing for me. I've heard of Dr. De Bono and expected much more than what he offers in this book. It's bascially an elementary book about common sense divided into different segments (hats). I would not recommend this book 
 They say Brian De Palma's `Femme Fatale' has a very tricky plot. It is true that the plot has a big twist, but I am not allowed to reveal it, so let me only say this. Whether or not you like the film depends on the incredibly convoluted story. I thought it is overcooked, way too much for me to take. But you might feel differently. Well, but who can tell?   All I can say with confidence is that `Femme Fatale' is a noir, or dark crime thriller that features a beautiful but dangerous woman Laure (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). At the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (and the scenes were shot during the real premier showing of `East-West') Laure and other robbers try to pull off a heist.   After outwitting other gangsters, Laure becomes another person named Lily. But how? You might not believe me, but she was so lucky that she could find an exact look-alike of her, and no one suspects the truth! Well, seven years later Laure is still doing this masquerading game successfully until one cameraman Nicholas (Antonio Baderas) takes a photo of her face, which makes the cover of a magazine. Now intrigues, blackmails, shootings, etc. ensue.  As the film's title suggests, `Femme Fatale' has references to crime thrillers like `Double Indemnity' Some might remember Hitchcock's `Vertigo' for the very obvious reason. Watching someone through a camera is a familiar theme to this genre (`Rear Window') and Brian De Palma himself has used it several times in his career. There are interesting details - Laure's hair, repeated images and hidden meaning of water and clock, for instance - and there is even split screen, signature technique of De Palma. Like his previous films (no, I'm not talking about `Mission to Mars' or `Mission Impossible'), `Femme Fatale' needs repeated viewings.   But for the following two reasons, I don't think many would watch it more than once. One is the weakness of the acting of the leading lady Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. I hear the contrary opinion about her, and I confess that my judgment about acting is totally subjective, but it is clear, I think, that she is no Barbara Stanwyck. I am not saying that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is not sexy - she is - but not good and seductive enough to call her femme fatale who can seduce a man and a woman alike (yes, look at the opening sequence, where some might have guilty pleasure like me).  And the other reason is THE twist that comes later in the film. Please see for yourself. For all the smooth camerawork of De Palma, and the beautiful photography of Thierry Arbogast (`The Fifth Element') and score of Ryuichi Sakamoto (`The Last Emperor') I felt I was cheated in the end. I never thought it is coming. But is it my fault that I didn't expect it?   `Femme Fatale' has stylish images and good soundtrack, but the script is too smart for its own good 
 I'd give this product zero stars if I could.    I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade.  So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.  I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad.  Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 This book had such great reviews so I decided to try it. What I found was a slow story.  I just didn't care about the characters and I struggled to get through the first 100 pages.  The writing was good, but it did not draw me into the story 
 Again, I am forced to serve as the lone reviewer who believes this film to be over-rated. I am definitely a Glenn Ford fan, but the idea that Ford simply waits for the train to come and take him away, while he and Van Heflin sidle down the street definitely didn't move me. I'm sorry but the rest of the film didn't ring true either. Richard Jaeckel gets killed in a weird, unrealistic way, and Henry Jones gets lynched somehow. The scenes with Heflin's wife are stagey and uncomfortably hard to believe. I would rate both Jubal and Cowboy much higher, more realistic, especially Cowboy. Check out Cowboy first and then Jubal. Either of these are better than 3:10. Sorry, Delmer Daves/Glenn Ford fans 
 Not bloody likely! He's done more work as a producer than he has as a recording artist. Yet here he butchers his own songs!  These rerecordings sound like they've been filtered through gauze. The instrumentals are muddied by heavy reverb, and they bury the vocals in many instances. Everything just seems off-kilter and out of balance.  What earthly reason could be motivating his refusal to rerelease "Proof Through the Night" and "Trap Door"? Perhaps he's waiting for most of us to tire of waiting and buy this mangled mishmash instead.  I say: No thanks 
 This book is a perfect example of people in ivory towers, and those who are afraid to admit they don't get it, jumping on a 5-star bandwagon. Faulkner titled this book perfectly, calling it The Sound And The Fury, while leaving out the rest of the phrase: signifying nothing. The first chapter is a noble, but failed, attempt at creativity. But almost no one, even the most well-read people, understands that the first chapter is written out of chronological order until they find out someplace else. The chapter's main point was as an excuse to get in Faulkner's description of what instigated the novel, a somewhat kinky description of looking up at the girl Caddy's muddy panties. A fatal flaw in the chapter, which never achieves a rhythm, is that Benjy, whose thoughts comprise the chapter, apparently has a photographic memory and thinks in completely lucid, complete sentences despite being an idiot. Caddy, the main character in a novel of stereotypes and pitiful prose, is actually a despicable trollop. She's characterized as Benjy's friend, but a careful reading shows that she only befriends him when it's convienent for her. Other chapters are even more sick than Benjy's castration, including the one with Caddy's brother lusting after her, or the hackneyed, cliché chapter with the old slave showing how much wiser she is than folk she serves. The Cliffs notes and other reviews perpetuate the idea that the book's theme is the downfall of the old plantation system. This is an invention; not found in the book. S&F, as Faulkner loudly hints in the title, is about nothing other than his infatuation with Caddy. It has no plot. And it is far from a great insight into the way people think. Only perverts think as these characters do. In the end, this novel is just page after page of sheer boredom. It's supposed to be a great book of human tragedy, but to feel tragedy you have to sympathize with the characters ... and all of the white characters in this novel are disgusting. All of its supposed great meaning, and the flip-flop in reviews from castigating to praising the experimental style, weren't dreamed up until 15 years after the first printing flopped, by literary professors who have to keep coming up with new ideas under the "publish or perish" law. It was only revisited because Faulkner did, eventually, write some good books. You want truly great writing? Try Steinbeck, Welty, Hemingway, Harper Lee, Dickens, Twain, Tolkien, Melville, Dostoyevsky, O. Henry, Wells, Verne, Maugham, Crane or even Rowling (Yes, Rowling. Her Potter books are complex, effortlessly intertwine several story lines and sublimely combine strong characterization, suspense and humor) 
 Hated it!  Save your money and read A Child Called It.  That's a book that covers abuse, if you're looking for abuse books.  This book is attempting to shock with stories of how the author's brother urinates in his mouth, how he later has sexual relations with his sisters and brothers and then struggles with his own sexual identity.  He later tells what a horrible husband and father he has become and then dedicates the book to his son as if that will cure the damage he has done. The authors trying to ride the coat tails of poor Elizabeth Smart and barely mentions anything about the abduction or Wanda Barzee.  There are about 3 pages total about this and the rest of the book cover the author's life in boring detail.  Seriously, there are much better books to read.  If you want a good laugh, look at the author's own review of his book - funny how he tries to convince you that he's try to help anyone.  How?  My advice is to seek therapy and not by writing a book 
 In most of the articles Kun has written, he goes on about his upbringing as a "rich kid in LA." I keep reading in various articles the same nostalgic patter about bar mitzvahs and being into records as if no one else in the world was, and more about being rich and a "disaffected Jew". They are strangely the same autobiographical stories, told over and over and over again, and so mundane and boring you wonder what the fuss is about, and what he's so proud of with this, and why he thinks we should view them as anything beyond the dull world of an over-indulged child of priviledge. True to form, the book starts out with this AGAIN! After his usual first person ramble on the subject (the reason why is unclear.. since often it has nothing to do with the subject matter being covered), he then goes on--  rambles on-- about the subject of "American music" (I think) -- switching to a opaque academic "professorial" voice, veering into various declarations about "race."   His "opinions" on race-- particularly Mexican and African-American (I'm talking about the poor societies therein, not the priveledged tier)-- too often come across through a foggy lens, not by someone who has a clear vision of and experience with the issue (why he impresses the fact that he lives in a glass house and then tries to get us to believe that he "really gets" the world of ghettos and poverty is beyond me). His attitude toward the world of the new Jewish immigrant in America is often insulting and strange, particularly in the way he mocks this group. This, and other rants, only impresses the fact that a boy in an ivory tower attempting a hipper-than-thou stance has little true understanding of the subjects he writes about. Beyond this turn off, there are other problems. This is a very poorly constructed book, and very tiring. The subject matter is far above the tiresome presentation and the quality of writing. Wish someone else had tackled the subject, and by a more outstanding press (but perhaps it was turned down by the bigger houses) 
 The title of this book is the giveaway.  Apparently, the author has not read the Constitution FOR the United States of America.  It is NOT the Constitution of the United States of America.  "for" places the Constitution in proper context as the set of rules for the government.  Look for someone who knows that there is no Constitution "of" the United States of America but there is a Constitution "for" the United States of America 
 My first book by this author and I will try to avoid her in the future.   I found the sisters just too dumb to be believed. The hapless victim left to fend for herself is getting to be an old over used scene in a lot of so called mysteries.   They always think the case is solved and go galloping off leaving the intended defenseless and unprotected.    Mediocre story at best.  Don't know where the title came from 
 Sadly, Chicago Poems (1916), the author's first published work, is the book for which self-styled folk poet Carl Sandburg is best remembered today. The collection takes a hard and unswerving look at the grim realities of urban life for the common man, funneled through the flume of the author's committed socialist ideological perspective. Such an approach to poetry may have been somewhat novel in the America of the time, and both history and critics have been kind to Sandburg's sympathetic portraits of human suffering.   But whether he is addressing "a dago shovelman," an immigrant who has forgotten the dignified being his ancestors in Europe or who can no longer recognize "the new-mown hay smell calling on the wind," a street walker with "haggard poems and desperate eyes," or a young woman burned to death in a factory fire, Sandburg continually adopts the simplistic notion that the lower economic strata of society is always victimized but virtuous, while governmental institutions, bosses of all stripes, the professional classes, and the wealthy are uniformly cruel, oppressive, exploitive, and, at best, indifferent.   Thus, Chicago Poems reads like a 132-page polemic with a very narrow political point of view. While many of the author's observations are poignantly insightful (such as the poverty-stricken family of a dead boy in 'The Right To Grief,' who are "glad it is gone, for the rest of the family will now have more to eat and wear"), the poems, when read together, take on an oppressively unbalanced character of their own.   In 'A Fence,' for example, "the rabble and all vagabonds and hungry men and wandering children looking for a place to play" stand outside the gates of a newly constructed "stone house on the lake front" built by a wealthy man, who, the poet infers, can be nothing but immoral, amoral, or corrupt. In the author's Usher-esque vision, nothing will be able to pass through the gates to the property except "Death and the Rain and Tomorrow." And tomorrow, for such a corrupt individual or family, will inevitably bring nothing but waves of bad conscience and fevered isolation. 'Soiled Dove' examines the life of a woman who "was not a harlot until she married a corporation lawyer," but who automatically becomes one by acquiescing to such a marriage, and who soon discovers her husband also loves "six other women," as if marital infidelity was limited exclusively to the upper economic classes. In contrast, 'Happiness' is confidently represented as "a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with their women and children and a keg of beer and an accordion," an image which may seem simultaneously naïve, patronizing, and condescending to many readers.   Occasionally, Sandburg wisely acknowledges that some portion of the tragedies of man's existence are simply inherent in the natural human life cycle. "The hand of God" also comes in for blame in several poems.   Chicago Poems is most effective when Sandburg bypasses social divisionalism--as he often did in his later volumes of poetry--and simply addresses the everyman in the individual. While these poems are often infused with a lyrical and tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent of James Whitcomb Riley, they also locate and acknowledge the beautiful within the tragedies that perpetually arise from human frailty, vulnerability, and mortality. In 'Dream In The Dusk,' the author warns that "tears and loss and broken dreams may find your heart at dusk," while 'Under The Harvest Moon' identifies "Death" as "the gray mocker, [who] comes to you as a beautiful friend who remembers." 'I Sang' describes a lover who has given up his heart to "you and the moon," but "only the moon remembers, and is kind to me."   Other poems have the more pronounced folk character of Sandburg's later volumes. The speaker in 'Theme In Yellow' is the pumpkin, who celebrates the paganistic dance of children around him "on the last day of October...singing ghost songs and love to the harvest moon...I am the jack-o-lantern with terrible teeth and the children know I am fooling."   The most recent edition of The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg (2003), which contains Chicago Poems in its entirety, is 832 pages long, and provides its readership with the full range of Sandburg's original and often gloriously rich and sensual vision of life. It also contains works like 'At The Gates of Tombs,' from Slabs of the Sunburnt West (1922), in which Sandburg, "the crazy wild dreamer," more fully and maturely developed his political vision. Comparatively, the reductive, often despairing Chicago Poems reads like the immaturely polarized work that it is.   
 sorry to say that i'm very dissapointed to own this book. For those who are new to VBA, it is not a good start from here. I also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program. I would recomend a book written by John Walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical 
 Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs.  Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that  are simply not documented.  In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF,  for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not  responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore  not responsible for the terrible consequences.  The millions of deaths that  resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did  inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if  this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country.  I don't  know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly  interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible  student of Chinese history 
 "Looker" is a very stylish film and was always one of my favorite Michael Crighton efforts (even better than "Westworld") and I would have rated it a solid 4 stars if it weren't for this *terrible* transfer job they did on it.  The problem is not with clarity, color or sound -- it's with the film gate.  They must have used the absolute worst machine in the world, because the image constantly moves even during static scenes.  If you watch this on a small (26" or smaller) set it may not bother you, but anything larger will drive you crazy, I can assure you.  Which is a terrible shame, because this little sleeper of a film (it went almost unnoticed when released) is worth seeing.  It contains one of Crighton's favorite themes -- tech misused or gone out of control -- and has the great Albert Finney giving a rare performance as an adventure hero.    My advice -- definitely don't buy this film.  Rent it from Netflix and give it a watch, particularly if you don't have a nice big screen TV.  Perhaps if and when this is released on high def they'll do a much better job (and then it would indeed be worth a buy) 
 Not a single insight. Not a single "aha". Go read something else 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 There is a good idea lost in the padding of this book.  And make no mistake this book is padded real good.  The author wants to sell you a bill of goods that Mona is just such a nobody.  Yes, yes.  She's rich and yes, she had this unique experience of living in a communte as a teenager.  And her and grammy would travel the world every christmas-but all of that is just BORING.  Sheesh.  What does the author think is exciting? And oh gee, she's so out of shape she needs to lose at least...TEN pounds.  So let's reinvent Mona!  All right--but there really wasn't any reinventing.  It was just a list of things that fell out the author's head with no rhyme or reason.  The comedic moments were forced and nine out ten times fell flat.  I never connected with Mona or cared whether she got her boring man or not.  And certainly didn't believe that she and Mike were in love.  What?  Chapters about Captain John or Mona retelling the whole book to the police precinct like the reader needed recaps were all attempts by the author to reach a word count.  Am I right to understand that eighty year old Capt. John married Vicki?  Was this an attempt to have a play on the other Vicki (We all know as Anna Nicole)?? Trips back to the commune-just to hear questions on whether or not her father was stoned the day of the accident?  Overall: buy a USED copy if you're absolutely curious-hopefully there's one selling for under a buck.  Any more than that and you just overpaid 
 This "toy" is the biggest waste of money! When I got it, there were few reviews out about it.  It is very complicated to use and the web site never works and there is nothing to do on it when it does.  They should be repaying all of us our money for having bought this! Don't waste your money 
 When I bought this book, intially I had an open mind about toilet training methods, but after reading this book I am sceptical about the child centred technique. The reasons outlined in the book have a circular logic which makes no sense to me. Also, some of the suggestions seemed just silly to me - for instance, the advice to change an active baby's dirty nappy in the bath while she pulls herself up and down!  Dr Brazelton outlines the reasons for changing to a child centred technique in the 60's  - to prevent the high occurrence of failure  from rigid early training schedules which involved punishment and shame. A much more rigorous study than the one which Dr Brazelton describes would have looked at age of training and use of punishment INDEPENDENTLY, and then drawn conclusions on what was causing the high failure rate. As the study was conducted it is impossible to conclude which of the two factors - early age or punishment- was more harmful.  Dr Brazelton gives a list of signs of readiness and then assumes that NO child will have these signs before the age of 2. I feel that this is greatly underestimating our children, and also patronising to other cultures around the world (who don't live in "our mainstream hygienic culture") who train their children at a much younger age.   I feel this book could be very confusing to parents as they endlessly wait for their child to exhibit ALL of the signs of readiness and NONE of the signs of not being ready. But some of the signs that a child is NOT ready could be due to waiting TOO long; for example,  1. A child sits on the toilet and then pees soon after standing up: This could also be to due the child having made a longstanding habit of peeing standing up which is possible in a diaper; 2. The child is not uncomfortable in a dirty diaper: This could also be because the child has been in diapers for so long, he has been conditioned to accept walking around with faeces smeared on his bottom!  Dr Brazelton strongly emphasizes that toilet training should be up to a child and that it is his achievement. Of course! No one else is in control of his muscles! Why then is this only possible after a certain age? In the book, he desribes how he pre-empts toilet training questions at the 12 and 18 month checkups and strongly advises parents not to start until after age 2. This to me smacks of interference well beyond what is appropriate between patient and doctor. No wonder parents are confused - they are told to ignore knowledge of their own child.  As a final note, I'm a bit tired of the hackneyed advice "Don't worry, your child won't be in diapers at college" that seems so prevalent from toilet training experts. More to the point is, "Will your child still be in diapers when he goes to SCHOOL?", which seems like a possibility if you endlessly wait for all the signs of readiness. Perhaps then your child could attend Dr Brazelton's Toilet school for untrained 4-6 year olds. 
 Bought one of these to jump start my 3.6 litre 911. It doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged. Complete waste of time, maybe it will start a lawn mower. 
 Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon 
 Overall, it works ok for turning on and off groups of components, setting the inputs and outputs and controlling the volume from the proper component. However, I hoped to replace four remotes with one when I bought this and this has not been the case. I've still got two remotes lying around and I'm not selling the others on eBay either! Even though it loads "all" of the functions associated with a particular device there are big mismatches between functions in the factory remotes and the functions in the logitech. This is the case even though most of my components are pretty mainstreem stuff (Sony KV-30HS420, Denon AVR-1801, Panasonic DMR-ES10, DirecTV H20) THere is no facility in logitech's online software to let them know that their data is AFU. So much for "continually updating our database"! Making this work has been a HUGE time sink. The software is stupid and beurocratic, sometimes asking irrelevant questsions (e.g. "What input does the DVD player use?" when you're setting up to watch the satellite.) While cheaper than some, the unit is  very expensive compared to other universal remotes I *should have* bought (e.g. Sony RMVL600 
 Although I am not a veterinarian, I have worked in an animal hospital for two years.  First of all, according to our medical practice, this book gives some bad nurishment advice!  Milk (and milk products such as cream and half & half) are NOT a good food for many cats.  Their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows' milk.  Having said what was foremost on my mind, I am also very disappointed in the "behavior" advice from this author.  I found very little information on kittens.....and almost nothing useful (which is why I purchased this book in the first place!).  In fact, I absolutely disagree with Ms. Wilbourn's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home.  From the new kitten arriving via "escort" to you (as the responsible owner) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon, as your adult cat "takes care of himself and his kitten".  What dangerous nonsense this is!  Stop and think.....what a 10 lb. adult could do to a 2 lb. kitten, if so inclined?  Perhaps the cats in Manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized (as opposed to Ms. Wilbourn's coined word "catsonality") then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar?  For the record, I currently have a terrific 15 year old, as well as a very feisty 4 month old.  I should have seen warning signs when this 224 page (LARGE print book) began with a 19 page forward.  No doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate Ms. Wilbourn's considerable knowledge.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Bottom line?  Save your money and try another author....preferably someone with the letters D.V.M after his or her name 
 Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small 
 I bought this book to better understand the inner workings of SIP but, instead, was greeted with a superficial introduction to a miriad of SIP applications, services and options. At the end of the day RFC3261 is a much better source of information, as dry as it might be. As such, I cannot recommend this book to anyone trying to learn the intricacies of SIP 
 I finally watched this borefest that I'd recorded from the Scifi channel last spring.  Too bad that I didn't accidentally erase it.  After four hours watching the "full version," I gained nothing and cared less about the characters and who did what to whom.  The only pluses to it were the attention to detail in costumes, props, etc. and the acting which was credible.  The story was preposterous even for a myth.  I cannot believe that anyone over the age of 12 enjoyed this or even consider it worthy of purchase on DVD 
 I am just a little younger then Linda Carroll and lived though the same era. I could not stand women like Linda back then who kept having babies as if they appear by magic and had no clue that you need to put the child you already have their needs first before your own. One has a moral duty towards your child to be a careful and compassionate parent. Linda was not.  She could have used birth control like the rest of us, her daughters life suffered and never worked to figure out how to parent Courtney. She was much too flippant a women getting pregnant every time she slept with a man. SHe wounded her first born very deeply by her actions.   Through her own words, she was a self-centered inadequate immature confused mother. Why she kept on having babies when she felt this way is beyond comprehension! Courtney does not need to write a book, her mother's book is proof why Courtney is estranged from her family. They did nothing but constantly reject her in childhood.   Linda claims her other children turned out healthy in spite of bad parenting decisions and a parade of men and fathers in their life.   She did not abandon the rest of them emotionally as she did Courtney. Except when she gave away her adopted son she parented for three years!  I almost fell out of my seat when reading this part.  Who listens to a child when they complain they do not want to move away, what poor judgment Linda constantly showed through out her mothering years. There was never one bit of empathy towards Courtney or acts of compassion or doing what was best for the kid, all her actions seemed to make her daughter more troubled and isolated. I was horrified to read she abandoned Courtney in the USA when she moved to New Zealand, then institutionalized her at 13 years old to never live with her daughter again.   It's a fascinating memoir becase it makes clear why Courtney is such a struggling confused and complicated troubled adult still riddled with problems. Her mother is a piece of work and acts blameless. Linda is too self-centered though-out Courtney's life to see she never found the time to understand the root of her daughter problems.   
 I ordered this player from Fingerhut and unfortunately didn't try to use it until the time to return it had expired.  IT HAS NEVER WORKED FOR ME.  The Power/Stand By light comes on and stays on and that is all it does.  It will not play anything.  I tried to call the Coby customer service and you never get through to anyone.  From what else I've read even if you get through they will charge $31 to replace the player which is more than the $29.99 it sells for new at CVS.  Don't buy it unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit I'm contemplating filing against them 
 Very disappointing.  Poor range 
 i have no idea how this movie managed to garner the reviews it has.  that this has been as heralded as it has shows a serious lack of respect for the genre.  this is a movie that has high aspirations, but low standards, disappointing both the cinema connoisseur AND action geek within me.  i respect what this movie was trying to do.  it wanted to be a crime thriller with a twist of hong kong action.  i've got no problem with that, and in fact i've been waiting for a movie like that for years.  but the movie failed to execute this plan properly, borrowing the wrong aspects from each of its derivative genres and turning it into the poster child of movies cited as reasons why action cinema deserves no legitimate consideration.  the basic premise was to make a crime drama, but for the violent sequences to be choreographed into stylistic martial arts fighting.  the problem came when the filmmakers tried to mesh the two- they didn't know which elements to use from which genre.  the crime drama is filmed like an assembly-line fight movie, with a confusing jumble of flashbacks ruining the pretty opening shot: pulse-light clips of a criminal being released from prison with 'hard' music behind it, followed by a two-years-in-ten-seconds montage of a man adopting a little girl with 'drama' music behind it.  i was willing to forgive all this, because the acting is actually very good here, and i convinced myself that the explosion of violence i was anticipating would make everything worthwhile, sort of 'equilibrium' style.  now, i've got a straight-boy crush on donnie yen, his action is top-notch, but what he tried to do here was ruined by the directing/editing.  firstly, the fights are sped up SO MUCH that i had a hard time figuring out what was going on!  people ran into each other, became a blur of hands, then broke apart, one of them maybe holding a bloody nose or something.  this is unneccesary.  katsu shintaro taught me that you don't need to speed film up for a man to be lightning-fast on camera.  'oldboy' taught me that you don't need to speed film up to have a totally captivating hand-to hand fight.  this movie couldn't wrap up the fight scenes fast enough.  second, the fights broke into the ridiculous on occasion.  i don't like wires, i don't like cg, and i DON'T like movie scenes that look like they were drawn by a manga artist.  the guy in white who used a knife looked like he walked straight out of 'blade of the immortal' into this movie.  now, if that was the kind of movie i was watching, i wouldn't have had any problem with that.  but as mentioned, this movie was also trying to be a legitimate crime drama, so having skinny donnie yen THROW sammo hung over his head into a glass statue kind of tends to ruin any dramatic merit they may have earlier built up.  so, since the brush of action had already corrupted the dramatic template, i still would have forgiven the movie if the action had been good enough.  mind you, i'm thrilled and content to have one single fight scene in a movie, so long as it's well filmed and the rest of the movie is good enough to watch as well.  but this movie was filmed like an action movie, so i unconsciously came to expect there to be more action than i got.  the fights were few, fairly compacted together, and entirely too brief.  when they happened, i had no idea what had just occurred, only that two of the men who HAD been standing were now lying on the floor.  the ending was terrible, i'm sorry to say.  i like a good surprise, but not when it comes at the cost of surprising the screenwriter.  it's like everybody got up to that point and couldn't figure out how to arrive at the ending they wanted, so they resorted to one of those age-old comic book deceits that even hong kong cinema has left behind at this point.  i'm sorry.  i REALLY wanted to like this movie, and i tried to do so throughout the entire thing.  the credits were pretty, the opening and closing shots were actually beautifully filmed, the acting was better than the writing deserved, and the fights probably WERE pretty good, if you watched them in slow motion.  but my expectations were as high as the filmmaker's aspirations were- and my final impressions ended up as disappointingly low as the filmmaker's standards did.  'the protector', also available on dragon dynasty, is a much better martial arts movie, featuring possibly the first ever filmed battle between capoeira and muay thai styles.  'oldboy' is an exceptional crime drama, with legitimate film merit, that happens to have an amazing fight sequence somewhere in the middle.  'breaking news' is a hong kong treat that properly showcases how to have a thoughtful action movie.  there's better out there.  don't be fooled by great reviews or, as i was, by a drool-worthy trailer.  kill zone disappoints, which in itself is a disappointment.  i expected so much more from this line-up 
 This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids.  All the characters are presented as totally one-dimensional cliches-- business leaders who refuse to lose, tough-acting butchy women with hearts of gold-- all your favorites are here! You're forced to read page after page of detailed conversations that are clearly fictionalized.  The author bends over backwards in an effort to elevate Bass and Wells to superhero status.  All of this can get very annoying!  The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of.  By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story 
 This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. The book is so repetative. The same event is explained at least three times 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 She should be held in the same contempt as serial killers.  Do we honor those who had people killed?  Just because they did not do the dirty work does not mean they are free from the crime.  This is what "Hanoi Jane" did and has been trying to gloss it over ever since.  I am sickened that she is on this list.  There are so many women who deserve this more than her.  Just because the incident took place in the 70's does not mean it has faded away.  She is a traitor to her country and for this reason I will discourage anyone from buying this book.  If you must read it please borrow it or visit the library 
 I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.  The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!! 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 This books sucks. All her books are awful. Read other bad reviews for more eloquence 
 Having left my studies of analytical philosophy many years ago - a fervent Wittgensteinian and ardent admirer of J.L. Austin - I had been looking for a way to learn what has happened since I left. It's the kind information that doesn't get into the newspapers and magazines. Soames' book fills the bill nicely, tracing the large patterns of development and at the same time working through key arguments and controversies in some decent detail. It's no replacement for a series of courses and careful reading of original texts, of course, but neither is it glib or patchy. It serves an important purpose to provide perspective on a subject that has developed to a great degree within academic journals. I haven't yet discussed it with Eccles, Bluebottle or Major Bloodnok. 
 Some of you may be familiar with the movie that bears the same name as this book. It shares a lot of instances with the movie, even though it takes place on a smaller sloop instead of a frigate. Several movie scenes were derived from the book, including some instances of dinner time banter, as well as the rigging of a decoy raft for the purpose of throwing off a pursuer at night.  The story follows Jack Aubrey as he finally receives a ship to command, a 14 gun sloop captured from the Spanish, and named the Sophie. He acquires a valuable friend through his love of music, named Stephen Maturin, who turns out to be a physician and an amateur naturalist. The battlefield is the Mediterranean Sea, and the home base is Gibraltar. Most of the book deals with the extraordinary success of the Sophie as a merchant raider taking various prizes across the southern coast of Spain and France, culminating in her greatest feat, the capture of the Spanish frigate Cacafuego (which translates just how you imagine it would), a much larger, more powerful vessel. There doesn't seem to be a great driving plot to the story other than a telling of events, along with a few side-plots which seem to be only of mere cursory importance, largely due to O'Brian's writing style.  Patrick O'Brian writes in a style that's hard to follow, partly because it's written in the English of the time, and partly because it's exceptionally dry for what someone would expect from a war novel. The concept was very sound, but I had a hard time feeling as inspired about what was happening, without closing my eyes and adding my own visuals to the plot, and imbellishing the passion behind a lot of the action. This is illustrated by a few of the instances that were adapted to the screen for the movie featuring Aubrey. For one example, while speaking about his encounters with Lord Nelson, I remembered the setting vividly from the movie, with the decent performance from Russell Crowe, and the reactions and faces of the men around him while they listened. The gravity of the moment was very well portrayed. In the book, it passed like the droll reading of a ship's log. His story was stuffed in a paragraph of speech and passed as dryly as everything else, with hardly any descriptive detail given to Jack's reverence for the subject, or the emotional reactions of those listening. So much of the book is like that, so it helped me to keep a running movie in my head, adding much needed descriptive seasoning to what I was reading.  The book had its high points, and even a few amusing points. O'Brian seems to write better when there isn't much in the way of action going on. Though, at times, the characters have a hard time just being direct with one another, and in effect, the reader has to be sharp enough to read between the lines of what they're saying to get the real meaning. A case in point was when Stephen was examining Jack, only to declare that his problem had to do with the woman he was sleeping with, Captain Harte's wife, had been surprisingly friendly all around. I don't know if I'm supposed to derive from this that Jack had contracted a venerial disease, or if it was simply a warning about the threat of Harte's grudge. Either way, I wish that in this, and in many other instances, O'Brian had made the effort to make things more clear.  The book left me without the urge to continue the series. Maybe I'm an uncultured bafoon, but I'm not going to force myself to read things that don't appeal to my sense of entertainment. I don't think I should have to envision descriptive imbellishments and then hope I'm correct, in order to feel enthralled by the books I read 
 To put it simply, Freedom Evolves is a philosophical failure, with as many holes as a Hollywood movie. I give the book one star for effort, for the attempt to get philosophy to the masses, and for pure entertainment purposes. But I subtract four stars because the premise is yet another arrogant attempt by a philosopher to gain a piece of the philosophical pie, one that I feel was eaten a long time ago, with mere crumbs remaining for contemporary thinkers. Dennett does not by any stretch get a crumb for this one.  Despite the myriad long-winded and frightened attempts to get around the harsh yet incredibly simple reality and logic of determinism, I have yet to see any valid arguments by any philosopher to even begin to disprove it. I'll go so far as to agree that we perceive an illusion of free will due to the individuality in character of each human being, based upon one's initial genetic programming and thereafter one's environmental programming, but that's as far as it can possibly go. We're still bound by cause and effect, just like every single other thing in the universe, "alive" or not. To think or state otherwise is merely another case of human self-flattery and arrogance, and therefore outright ignorance (or, in Dennett's case, opportunism to boot). The potential proof of parallel universes in physics will still have no bearing on the issue. And evolution, as Dennett attempts it, works more against his arguments than for them.  Recommended if you enjoy pop philosophy for clever entertainment only. Otherwise, with all the logical holes in it, you could use the book to strain your spaghetti 
 Im a skater and thought this will help me with my skating. It sucked 
 I was Looking for a book about reversals, and I read so many great reviews that I got mine.  I'm not saying the book is bad, I'm so not qualified to do so, but what I didn't like was the tone: "oh we're so good,  our tarot community is so great, we're so cool"...pleeease.  About the book: never got around to finish it, got bored 
 Although the thesis of this book is  thought-provoking, the language in which it is written is dull and disengaging.  The author uses many references to books and films from the early part of the 20th century,  which not many people are familiar with today,and this definitely detracts  from the book's quality.  Also, the entire book could have been compressed  into 100 pages--the same thing is repeated over and over again in different  words 
 Redcoats is a book for the historian or academician but not the general reader. Brumwell has one point to make, more or less, that the English soldier in North America adapted to the style of fighting needed during the French-Indian War and was effective. This does not require an entire book and does not make for an interesting one. Every page contains several footnotes which usually don't explain anything further and could better be placed at the end. I had to work to finish the book. But possibly I'm being unfair in that I was looking for a book to build on my understanding of the war and not such an esoteric treatment of one part of it 
 One of the most boring books you'd ever read. The language is as rich as it'll ever get, but it used to narrte the muse of someone tethering on the verge of insanity. I've battled through 150 odd pages of the book and can't understand the premise. The ruthless (upto 5 times on every page) use of the word "naked" & "ruddy" gets irritating. I fail to understand as to why would the author think that people from Mexico are evil and are pulling the earth beings down. A dark & useless book. Stay away!! 
 I just got this from Amazon - working on returning there is no range between the PAW and doorbell chime. Even at 2 - 3 feet away with brand new batteries it seems to have issues. I thought it would be more usable than a hanging bell and easier to install with less holes and hardware. The PAW is more like a toy so you have to mount it and since there is no range u have to mount the reciever directly above it. With the range of the one I have it would of made sense to combine the two 
 Two years after print, I found the LP Ecuador guide to be very outdated.  The book was written when the Sucre was the currency of Ecuador, now that they have change to the dollar, all of the prices have increased 20%-40% over what the book says.  Also, I found that it lacked information on good, reliable tour operators.  I found more reliable tour operators and better prices by doing online searches and by going to the towns and asking around.  I believe that a lot has changed in Ecuador since the publication of this 6th addition so I suggest finding a more recently published guide 
 I was dissapointed in this book. I found it a difficult read because the text was inundated with percentages, statistics and numbers. The author used statistics and percentages, which can be manipulated to 'prove' anything, to back up every one of her statements and opinions.  I would have perfered much more straight reporting of her ideas and feelings and much less this mish-mash of numbers and percentages. A very cumbersome read 
 This book must have been the rigging bible...in 1970.  There is very little mention of motorized rigging and modern trussing used in the majority of stage, concert and corporate events.  I would strongly recommend NOT buying this book unless you're looking for a historical document of how rigging was performed 35 years ago 
 Yah just don't go messing with a series' soundtrack.  Especially on the original Japanese track!  : 
 We were big fans of TaxCut, especially after Turbo added spyware ..... THIS YEAR'S TAX CUT has irreguarities that are costing ($$) me ......... for example, you file your college student's return and check the box that she/he will be an exemption on the head-of-household return & then comes the surprise, head-of-household can't file their return with that college student as an exemption, despite checking the proper boxes! ....... for example, it can't caluculate railroad retirement benefits ..... for example, it tells you that your return is a-okay, you pay $15, then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another $15 to refile! ........ good-bye Tax Cut! 
 I'll try to start with something positive: the cover is pretty.  Beyond that, I'm not going to put more time into my review than the author spent "writing" this book which means I've got 5 minutes or less. This is a collection of newspaper columns. If the author wrote 10 columns on the same topic and included them all in the book, he didn't even bother to edit out the redundancies. Columns that span 20 pages in the book could have been reduced to 4 by eliminating the 80% of each column that he spent repeating the previous day's columns. Couple that with columns that spend 10-20 pages arguing against a particular injustice, only to see in a 1 paragraph note at the end that the injustice was indeed righted, or that the column is 5 years out of date and no longer relevant with events that have transpired since, and one gets the sense of a writer with little respect for his readers and their time. Done. In under 5 minutes. 
 I have specialized in providing professional education and therapy to divorced, courting, and re/wedded couples since 1981. I am (a) 66, (b) a stepgrandson, stepson, and ex-stepfather and stepbrother, (c) an invited Board member of the Stepfamily Association of America, (d) a contributing editor to 'Your Stepfamily Online,' and (e) the author of six personal-growth and family-relations books.  I recommend this book to readers who want a well-organized overiew of the complex premarital and re/marital counseling process. I caution readers that the authors omit several essential points which cripples the utility of their book:    1) why and how to assess and reduce co-parents' psychological wounds from childhood (vs. divorce). The authors lay the groundwork for this, but don't guide readers on how to follow through;   2) the origin and impacts of blocked grief in adults and kids, and how to spot and reduce it. There is no entry for "grief" in the book's index;   3) co-parent unawareness of five key topics: (a) normal personality formation, composition, and function; (b) keys to high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, (d) healthy 3-level grief, and (e) stepfamily realities, norms, implications, and hazards. And...    4) little effective re/marital and co-parenting help (i.e. courtship coaching, classes, informed counseling, co-parent support groups) available in most communities and the media.    In my clinical experience since 1981, these factors will often block the best-intentioned adults from following relevant  re/marital and co-parenting advice. Counseling couples who are courting and re/married - specially any with existing kids - without including these factors in assessment and interventions can only be partially effective.

 I was incredibly disappointed with this film.  After reading all the Earthsea books, I was appalled at how much the movie DIDN'T follow the books it was based on.  The special effects in this movie were just awful.  Poorly done 3D graphics, as well as over used smoke machines and badly done blue screens.  There was very little effort, or so it seems, put into creating realistic effects.  The acting was absolutely abysmal.  I will admit that Shawn Ashmore, and Kristen Kreuk were the best actors, but they are FAR above this type of cheap, cheesy film.  I also enjoyed Chris Gauthier as Vetch.  But the rest of the acting was overdone, cheesy, and just plain awful.    I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has actually read the books.  Instead, watch the 10th Kingdom.  Very enjoyable film.  Unlike this bit of trash 
 If you're looking for a good clothing history, don't bother with this book.  Hollander's arguments are poorly written and unsupported.  There's no evidence that she did any research 
 McCann wrote a rich, detailed and realistic depiction of Cromwellian England.  She has an eye for detail that made me really REALLY want to like this book.  Unfortunately, the main character is a self-obsessed whiner who constantly sabotages himself.  I wanted to like him, and I wanted to root for him, but toward the end of the book, I had a hard time seeing his story through to the end.    This is an excellent book for people who like endings where little is resolved, and who like having to read the last chapter three times in order to figure out what happened.  It's also good for people who enjoy dark, cheerless tales with their protagonists self-absorbed and incapable of moving past their mistakes.  I don't want to be too harsh on the book, but it's just not my cup of tea 
 Talk about a typically clueless American. I threw this book away after reading about half in exasperation 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 I haven't even read the book, i have read exerts and refuse buy such irrational ideal.  Read Ishmeal!!  EARTH is not OUR WORLD, we are defying the laws of nature and think it is OKAY!  We need to control our population, or on a more drastic end stop feeding the homeless, stop curing the ill, allow nature to take its course thereby reducing our population.  I would prefer the former to the latter, education and action concerning this worlds grave state need to be addressed and soon.  IN THIS GENERERATION, we need to stop putting it off 
 I read the book before seeing the movie. The book was good. The movie was terrible. I did not like it at all. The movie did not follow the book. The movie had inaccurate accounts compared to the book and the Rose Red movie 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 From the title, I thought this would be a great book - classic sweaters designed for larger women. Um, not as such.  The vast majority of the models for the book? Apparently sizes 8-12. There's one, count it, *one* model who looks like she might wear a plus size.   I wasn't overly impressed with the garments themselves, but that pales beside the fact that I can't trust them to be sized correctly for plus sizes because their models are not plus-sized 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month---than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with.  I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either.  A sales person and I tested them all, hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked.  It was more disappointing  after calling Kodak ---they were unable to replace it or get my money back.  I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision, however, they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing.  
 This insipid remake takes far too many liberties with the story, butchers its source material, and unsurprisingly ends up being quite a mess. Furthermore, the movie doesn't even really make sense when you think about it. The protagonist this time wants to travel to the past to save his love, and finds he can't alter what happened. He then goes to the future where he CAN alter events. The remake entirely forgets the point that the Eloi are supposed to be human cattle. That they're not kind of entirely destroys the whole point of the book, and the film greatly suffers as a result. The character played by Jeremy Irons was a dumb addition to the story. Ironically, the special effects used to depict the Morlocks were better in the 60s film 
 This could have been much better with an editor.  I didn't need to be told repeatedly about not speaking a Native American's name -once would have been plenty 
  I was really interested in the subject. I read the back cover and that's all the information I got from this story. The authors may have a point, I don't know. But as far as being able to tell it they surely lack any talent.  This is the most boring and ugly read I've done in some years. I don't care how important it is or how true, if you can't tell it you should waste people's money and time like this: let someone else do the writing. What does the general reader know or care about the technological devices the authors mention? Just give me the facts, please. 
 If you are reading this book, you probably fit into one of two categories. 1. You are a local from the region surrounding Coney Island or 2. You were assigned the book as required reading from a college History class.   While Kasson has certainly done his research on his subject, he struggles at times to find a story with some drama where very little drama exists. To make things more difficult, the reader is subjected to a sort of bastardized version of early twentieth century verbage throughout the text. For example, Kasson is particularly fond of the word "gentry" and uses it and other arcane terms frequently in presenting the story. Most likely, the intent was to give the reader a sense of the period in which the story occurs. Unfortunately, the effect is confusing, dry, and alienating rather than engrossing. Kasson does sucessfully connect individuals who have their own places in history to Coney Island, which is most likely why the book is cited so frequently in other books (132 at latest count) regarding this segment of history. The book is very difficult to read cover-to- cover. It appears that the auther intended for the reader to skip back and forth throughout the text. The final pages end with a one sentence wrap up and a picture. It is almost as if the author himself lost interest in his subject and called it a day. File it somewhere between an antique store and your Grandparent's family photos. Nice for a curious Coney Island history buff. Otherwise, a pretty dull and tedious read 
 I just received the printer. In trying to set it up, I realized there is no computer to printer cable included, nor any explanation  of what kind you need. You have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema 
   Nothing is so disgusting as an author who creates in his own mind, regardless of the evidence, some historical gobbledgook under the guise of science.  Price totally ignores Venona files(1992) evidence that McCarthy saved the United States and totally destroyed Soviet plans for the internal overthrow of the US government.   This book is destined for the garbage bin appropriately named "inaccurate historical fiction. 
 Oh, what a bitter little man is Marcus Gray.  I don't know how anyone can excuse this hate festival of a "book."  All that Gray does is make personal attacks (mostly on Joe Strummer), and claims that his purpose is to take apart the myth of the Clash.  No.  He clearly has a major bone to pick with them (especially Joe Strummer.)  I gained no new information from this book, nor was I entertained by the "author's" writing style.  The only thing that we know for sure about these four guys is that they made great music, and were human beings, no more or less flawed than any of us.  The only thing that we know for sure about Gray is that no one will write a biography about him, nor, in the spirit of this "author," will anyone, but the handful of people who may consider him a relative or friend, notice when he exits the planet.   
 This is an inspiring story about one of the TRUE heroes of the United States, honored (much too late) both at home and abroad.  That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition!  When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section.  The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs!  Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years.  Reprehensible and unconscionable 
 I bought this book thinking, "hey, its sorta like Artemis Fowl, right? It can't be that bad...." I WAS HORRIBLY WRONG!!!! When I finished I thought-  "I spent $18 on this c**p!" I really can't explain why it dissapointing. Maybe my expetations were too high or something like that but this book really dissapointed me. If you're really set on reading this get it from the library first. Don't make the mistake I did by buying a book you'll end up hating. It might of been the air of satanisim around the whole thing that made me hate it but maybe its just me. If you want a good read, read the Artemis Fowl series or something by Ben Jeapes. Just remember TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIBRARY FIRST!!! I don't want anyone to waste almost $20 on this like me. This goes for any book one has read a lot of controversial reviews about. For potential buyers of Faerie Wars, heed my warning. 
 These pillows are too soft and too small. They don't provide adequate neck support, and are more uncomfortable than the pillows I bought them to replace 
 The book is amazing; this movie adaptation is quite poor. Although the actress who plays O is quite beautiful, and there are some fairly erotic scenes, this movie is deeply flawed, and I can't recommend it. The plotline gets totally garbled, especially toward the end, to the point where it runs entirely contrary to the book's intention on several key philosophical and psychological points. Second, the actor who plays Stephen is absolutely one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen; doesn't fit the role one bit. So please, read the book. If you've already read the book and love it, it is probably worth your while to eventually see this film, but expect to be disappointed. 
 I saw this when I was shopping at Tower Records and it was 15 bucks so I am a fan of the offspring so i bought it.  I am very dissapointed.  I mostly bought it for the live concert video footage, but it seemed so fake.  I think the video is real concert footage, but the music is studio!  What a ripoff.  Also, its stupid to buy it just for the music videos cuz you can find that online for free 
 Dava Sobel has written some excellent books about science. This is not one of them. I got this as a quick review of the science of Planetology; it is a very strangly written account of the history of Planetology. Ms Sobel adopts an oddly florid style throughout which makes it very difficult to understand. In two cases she uses a first person voice; once as the the meteor which is believed to be from Mars and once as the sister of William Herschel. In both cases it is so strange that it is difficult to follow. In the narrative about Jupiter she spends as much time going on about astrology as astronomy. I have no idea if Ms Sobel is serious about Astrology (I hope not) but as an experienced science writer she should be aware that it has no legitimate place here.   There are other, less confusing accounts of the planets. Buy them and avoid this 
 There is no reason to read The Cloud in translation. It is written in simple prose and in one of the easiest Middle English dialects for Modern English speakers to read. This edition of the book is an unnecessary  translation into Modern English in which a great deal of the original works subtleties and nuances are lost. Because the text was written with such close attention to language it is truly inexcusable for any one to read it in translation when then original is completely accessible to the Modern English speaker. I therefore recommend the edition the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, edited by Patrick J. Gallacher and available for roughly the same price, instead of this version 
 Chesler's tone is so patronizing here. Third wave feminists did not just step out of a cave, the older amongst us (those now in our later 30's to early 40's like myself)  saw these events unfold as children and it's throughly seared in our minds. Ms. Chesler ignores the fact that in the 1987 March for Reproductive Rights on Washington DC, in which 500,000 women marched, 2/3 were then under 30 years old (the third wave feminists, this was our first major- in numbers present, activist appearence) This book tempted me to write a letter FROM a young feminist. But I decided not to, because if Ms. Chesler was determined to ignore third wave feminists, despite much activism by us, a letter refuting her claims of our ignorance wasn't going to open her eyes. Readers are better to choose books by second wave feminists that are better written and informed, like Gloria Steinem's. I'd also recommend books by older third wavers like Naomi Wolf and Susan Faludi. 
 I bought this book, because of the great reviews, but I must agree with the comment "If you know ANYTHING about developing software...ANYTHING at all...this book is a complete waste of time." Area of release planning IS interesting and difficult, but solution is not this book 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 Might be a good video...it just doesn't interest our 10 month old yet like Baby Einstein does 
 I wouldn't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it 5 stars...a real injustice.  This is a piece of garbage, plain and simple. If you liked their first cd you'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band, no joke. The guy has a horrible voice and it's only good when he yells, which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd, both of which fall apart after the heavy point.  PURE GARBAGE, if you don't believe me buy it and see for yourself, there's a reason this cd isn't as popular as Through The Eyes and its cause IT SUCKS 
 I'm baffled by the glowing reviews posted by PW, Booklist, and my fellow amazon readers.  This book is nowhere near the quality of earlier Francis efforts (see Whip Hand, Forfeit, Come to Grief, Enquiry).  As a couple of other reviewers have noted, familiar characters--Jenny, the Admiral, Archie Kirk, Jenny's new husband--have undergone complete personality transplants.  Wonderful characters from previous books now come off as weak and foolish (or bitchy in the case of Jenny & Anthony).  Even Sid has lost his magic.    Rigorous editing would have helped, and surely Francis deserves Putnam's best.  But in this book, the usual spare and effective dialogue has turned clunky ("I've got to make a phone call," I said to the policeman.  "Now!  It's urgent!"), awkward ways of passing information to the reader abound (several sentences of dialogue begin "As you know ...", and at one point an asst trainer gives _Sid_ an explanation on the importance of not smoking in a stable!!!), and portions of the plot are weak (see the thoroughly inexplicable behavior of villain in ch. 19).   But, honestly:  I'll keep reading these books as long as Francis keeps publishing them.  (There are strong passages and elements here, in addition to the problems I mention above.)  Here's hoping we see a return to form in the next effort.  And many, many thanks for the dozens of fabulous novels that came before 
 Without the music (which is described throughout), this book is rather lame.  A novelization of the movie, written as though someone asked Jimmmy Steinway (the ad guy who kept trying to get his clients into "The Club") to write it years after he wrote the movie script.  You're left wondering: did this really happen or not?  Why did Stillman feel the need to write this book?  Although it does explain certain character's motivations, which weren't really clear in the movie, it kind of goes overboard with a little too much insight, even for a novel. In my opinion, it wasn't realistic, and the characters were even more superficial than the movie.  In the movie, you know nobody acts that way in real life, but it's a movie!  And since when is the IRS a client of an advertising agency?  Why would the Charlotte and Alice both be only TWENTY years old in the September following their graduation from college? No mention of skipping grades, starting first grade at age four, or both of them going to college during the summer, in which case, they'd still both be twenty-one.  This isn't the 1930's where kids start first grade at age five, there is no sophomore year in high school, so everyone graduated high school at age sixteen.  Just a glaring inconsistency which bothered me.  The movie is much more entertaining. 
 The only helpful thing in this book was the description of the five types.  This does provide a framework for analyzing different position.  The types could have been defined in a much shorter work.    The book does not offer clear Biblical argumentaion for or against differnt views.  One flaw (which is apparently common in Liberal theology) is that he talks about the New testament writers postions as if they were contrary and not complementary to each other.  For example he talks about Pauline and Johanine Theology as if they had separate, and contradictory on some points, views.   With each view Neibhur talks about a few historical people who have held this view.  These people are for the most part extremist who have taken one idea and thrown out the rest of the Bible. The majority of them were heretics.  The association of each view with some very extreme exponents of it may give the conservative Christian the impression that the view itself is heretical (Which it may or may not be).    More work needs to be done on this subject with Biblical argumentation for the different views.    If in reading this book you are (as I was) attempting to develop a Biblical theology of Christ and Culture I believe you will find it a dissapointment.    
 This is a great book, if you want your child to think of all kinds of great things you can do with your hands.  but..If you are looking for a book to teach your child WHY you should not hit or anything about feeling and emotions involve in hitting than this is NOT the book for you 
 This movie is entirely fictional and is NOT based on true events. First of all, the great 'Saviors' family was killed by muslims, and so he chooses to go killing some muslims in a completely different country. That in in itself shows that the director hates muslims and limits all muslims to being 'bad'. The other thing is the way that he portraied Bosnian-Muslims; main causes/killers of the war, which is a complete lie. The serbs goal was to eliminate the whole Bosnian-Muslim population and create a dominant ethinc group; the serbs ofcourse. Also he forgot to mention the attack on Srebrenica where serbs killed over 8000 civillians in just one day...I just have to asume that the director LOATHES all muslims as he completely LIED.    
 I fail to understand why reviewers seem to be bowled over by this collection of murky and poorly written stories. If you take the trouble to figure out what's going on, the payoff seems minor compared to the work it took 
 Great idea that doesn't live up to it's hype.  Two issues, it steals the USB ports completely and often causes problems with one's computer.  More importantly, it doesn't cool down drinks, or even maintain them.  They usually warm up to room temperature within an hour, whether on the coolIT or not.  Disappointing performance 
 The author of this work was what drew me to this title.  Peter Blauner wrote The Intruder and I absolutely loved that book.  This book however leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  The characters are not drawn out very well and the story drags on forever.  Many of the players in this book are not needed and just prolong the agony of the reading.  The end, although exciting, could have been better.  All in all this a book that I have to say would be better if skipped 
 It's tempting to start this review by saying sociologists should stay away from musical topics, at least if they can't appreciate music, and I mean *appreciate* rather than "enjoy." But maybe a fairer criticism would be if you're going to upset the apple cart this much, you'd really better have a sturdier theory than Tina DeNora has here. DeNora is a sociologist at the University of Exeter, and she thinks Beethoven's genius was constructed by society. She says Beethoven's place in the musical firmament was a result of certain aspiring elite aristocrats of the time having a predilection for Beethoven's "difficult" music in an attempt at social one-upmanship and wanting to use him to advance their own standing in Vienna. To put it simply, Ludwig was at the right place at the right time, he had the luck. There is no analysis of the music itself in this book, because she has decided it is irrelevant. I'm not kidding.  DeNora would likely argue that our criteria for "greatness" have been pre-determined by the very elements that we then go into a "great work" looking for. The aesthetics of criticism are a social construct, and so is the music; therefore it's no wonder the two fit together so well. Music criticism is taste writ large, that's all. (Sociology, on the other hand, is not subject to these social tastes and trends, of course.)  Actually, I felt upon approaching this book there may be something to her argument. As Michael Walsh jokingly and insightfully remarked in his book Who's Afraid of Classical Music, "Ludwig 'Rights o' Man' Beethoven was always sucking up to royalty in his dedications." It's hard to deny: he knew who buttered his bread. It's easy to view talent, especially when from the distant past, in a vacuum that we don't extend to the present. In today's world I find myself wondering, for just one example, if a fine but unremarkable actress such as Gwyneth Paltrow would be where she is were her mother not Blythe Danner and her father not a prominent TV producer who is good buddies with Steven Spielberg. Is it any coincidence that Gwyneth's first role was in a Spielberg film, Hook?   So what does DeNora say? After several chapters on the state of the aristocracy and aristocratic taste of the time--chapters I enjoyed and am not prepared to defend or debunk--she focuses relentlessly on the famous quote about Beethoven from Count Waldstein, saying he would go forth to receive the spirit of Mozart from the hands of Haydn. DeNora argues, repeatedly, (she seems to think that by repeating a groundless assertion she can make it stick) that this statement played a huge role in elevating Beethoven to greatness in the minds of the Viennese aristocracy. Of course this begs the question how did Mozart and Haydn achieve *their* reputations? Sure Beethoven understood how he could benefit socially from the patronage of Haydn--he?d have to be an idiot not to understand it--but seeing it solely on those simplistic terms ignores the fact that he was innovating, and that except for Mozart and Haydn his contemporaries were not. DeNora seems to make a big deal out of this, saying they were thrown on their own as freelancers because they lacked Beethoven's connections (while giving us no real evidence that this is in fact the reason they "went commercial" and he succeeded as a serious artist). She conveniently ignores the fact that Schubert had no significant connections, yet has also come down to us as a "great composer." Hummel's sonatas, written around the same time as Beethoven's and Schubert's, show just how far ahead of their time Beethoven and Schubert were. But this is not mentioned.  Furthermore DeNora either underplays or seems unaware of the reputation of Mozart, of how his music was also considered extraordinarily difficult well into the 19th century. Beethoven himself singled out the fifth "Haydn" quartet of Mozart and said that in this work Mozart was showing to the world what he could do if only they were ready for it. Of course, some of Beethoven's patrons had also been Mozart's, but this shows the idea of serious music did not begin with Beethoven, and this makes her thesis about changing tastes in the aristocracy weaker.  But DeNora's argument spectacularly self-destructs on page 119, in one of the most amazingly inept chapters of any book I've ever read. She describes the first time pianist Gelinek competed with a young Beethoven in a duel in 1793. Gelinek expressed confidence he would destroy Beethoven--make mincemeat of him by one account. The next day the father of the person telling the tale asks Gelinek how he did and the pianist admitted he was the one pulverized. Keep in mind he did not know of Beethoven or his reputation before the duel. You'd think DeNora would see this as a strike against her thesis, but she actually says (p. 121): "First, whatever Galinek thought of Beethoven is less relevant in this context [!!] than the ways his conversations were converted subsequently into topics in their own right--material for further discussion within the music world." Never mind that this person who never heard Beethoven before and was unaware of his reputation, by DeNora's own admission, was blown away and humbled, what matters is how the result elevated Beethoven's position. It never occurs to her that perhaps it elevated his position because it was deserved! But she doesn't stop there: "Once again, we see that Beethoven's reputation *can be conceived of as the accumulation of a repertoire of recorded, publicized stories about his talent.* [emphasis mine, out of disbelief] She goes on: "In telling the story of Beethoven's talent, Gelinek positioned himself as subordinate to Beethoven (as a less talented but admiring colleague); thus Galinek testified to and helped to publicize a favorable view of Beethoven's talent by aligning his own abilities as inferior to Beethoven's." What is one to make of this idiocy that passes for sociology? DeNora never for a moment considers that perhaps Gelinek simply believed what he said. I think it's obvious she reached her conclusion before she began and worked backwards, determined to cram every fact she uncovered into her theory even if she had to pound the loose ends down with a sledgehammer.  Musicologist and pianist Charles Rosen, in a rebuttal shortly after the DeNora book was published, commented that an ethnomusicologist once told him there surely must be hundreds of "Eroica" symphonies that we just don't know about, written by unknown geniuses galore. As Rosen points out, we do indeed know many if not most of the works of Beethoven's contemporaries; many have been analyzed, revived and recorded. They do not come close to Beethoven in originality, breadth of thought, or structural sophistication. But DeNora, like so many revisionists with an agenda, loses her finely-honed sense of skepticism when dealing with alternative interpretations to events. Then she really tips her hand: "While these programs [of cannonic revisionism] obviously vary in levels of ambition, they share a concern with the ways exclusive or ?high? cultural forms are both inaccessible and inappropriate to the lived experience of a large proportion of the people to whom they are upheld as inspirational."  That astonishing remark could be interpreted in ways ranging from merely patronizing to racist, and it sets DeNora up as a sort of cultural arbiter herself. *Inappropriate?* Says whom? Inappropriate to whom? And why?   After all this, there is still one remaining gripe, and that is DeNora?s writing style. It is repetitious in the extreme. She really has a thin point, and takes well over 200 pages to make it. This book could have been a magazine article or two- or three-part series in a journal. Trash 
 I wanted to really like this book--it had a great sounding premise, that's why I bought it without checking with other book readers first. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the way the characters went from one reality to the next to be unbelievable. Also, I didn't get to know and care about the characters. 
 How do you spell 'sucks'? Easy - A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R!  I loved Stone's JFK, but this... Words fail me, but I'll try to find a few. Okay, the pros? Angelina Jolie. I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.  This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!  And I won't even mention the blonde wig! 
 The quality of his writing style aside, the book promotes the dangerously deceptive notion that the war in the former Yugoslavia was a distinctly "Balkan" phenomenon. Its romantic and sexy theory of a bloody history that returns to wreck havoc on the region paints people from the Balkans as two dimensional characters who are naturally given to violence. Anyone who has visited the region knows this is not the case. The fact is that what happened in the Balkans can happen anywhere under the right (or wrong) circumstances, and indeed has happened across the world many times before and since. If you buy the book, enjoy the writing, but remain skeptical of his theories and read other words on the subject like Balkan Babel or Love thy Neighbor for a more complete view 
 This book was not what I expected. It did not really get into how to ACTUALLY date like a man. It was about dating like a woman who knows how a man thinks.  This book was not helpful AT ALL. LOL. I cannot believe the raving reviews it got 
 My Son loves these books. However, the flaps rip off very easily. He really misses these books! Without a lot of effort or very aggressive "lifting", these flaps on several of Karen Katz's books ripped right off.  Great books, but need to re-engineer these for toddlers and better wear & tear 
 if i could give this music negative stars i would. no kidding i got nauseous listening to this band. i seriously was on the verge of losing my lunch as one song led into the next and i headed straight to the bathroom after being tortured by them all. a hard-to-believe reaction, i know -- i was wondering myself how it was possible to get physically sickened by a cd, but then i figured it out: it just goes in circles and circles and circles and circles and circles and circles and circles. HOLD STEADY? i WISH! it's TORTUROUS. on top of having a boring-as-hell voice, vocally this guy "sings" the SAME 2 or 3-note "melodies" for every song. wtf? + musicwise it's the same level of Abysmally Boring and Uninventive -- and let me repeat -- CIRCLES. the "band" does the exactly the same "music" for EVERY song. how can anyone say good things about these guys??? bravo to the other two reviewers who gave them one star. i'm happy to see that at least two people in the world have ears. it's astounding to me that crap like this gets recorded. even more astounding that crap like this generates fans. 
 This CD while full of nice music, is to me rather pointless.  It's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals.  Does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie?  Aside from Crazy train 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 I am disappointed with the new format.  I have been buying this calendar for myself and for family and friends for the past 10 years.  I do not like that the photos carry over to 2 pages.  I do not like the all black dates and I miss the quotes/passages from books that related to the particular photo.  
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated. As someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area, I found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information. Not a good choice if you are a novice. Too bad I could not give it zero stars 
 This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster.   Don't waste your money on this turkey. 
 This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one 
 Wow!  This toy was made as cheap as possible.  Shame on crayola for not spending the extra pennies to make this more durable and a better quality product. Great concept, but poor designers!  Steps aside crayola - your name doesn't stand for much anymore! 
 I tend to break my wireless cards for my laptop. I had CISCO's, BELKINS, NETEGARS and they all worked flawlessly.  With the D-Link the software will not even install on my WINDOWS XP laptop. When you double click it it just won't come up or comes up for a second only. I got it to work by using the native WINDOWS drivers for about 15 minutes...then it repeatedly caused WINDOWS blue screens....  I talked to Tech Support but as with all network companies you get some junior person who follows a script...no help there at all though the phone was answered quickly.   I have used many network vendors and D-Link consistently dissapoints me ( I have a wireless printserver that is bad too ). This was the second and last time I go for the cheap price. They just have bad products and if you add shipping and return fees and all the headache you can buy a better product... 
 This wasn't a good followup to Blue to me.  It would have helped if LeAnn Rimes didn't sing too LOUD on this one!  While the emphasis is on inspirational songs, the music comes off as overproduced, overblown and LeAnn tries to pull off her own Celine Dion by overdoing it a third on most of the ballads.  Even the remake of Debbie Boone's overplayed You Light Up My Life comes off as limp. The listening performance comes off as as disturbing and misconceived, not inspiring at all as the album title wants you to believe. It's like LeAnn was pressured to get a record out on the market after the massive success of Blue. Would have been better if she sang an album of new material instead back in 1997. 
 This book is the typical fake statistics written by political scientists who do not know that they are talking about to political scientists who will never know about the true statistics. Do not waste your money and time on such junks. Another book to avoid: unifying political methodology by Gary King. Spend your money and time on books written by real statisticians instead. Learn first hand from those who know 
 This book should have been titled "How I Got My First Job At 26 And Then Started Planning For My Retirement" It's a book about how Asha Tyson expanded her awareness. It's full of inspirational zingers gleaned form other writers but she never get's to the 'how to'. Here is her definition of retirement "Retirement is taking on the responsibility as a brilliant life form to make a contribution with your gifts."  What??? She also says that anyone can do what she has done but then says,"By age nine, I was narrating plays and giving keynote addresses at banquet halls for award and appreciation ceremonies." Also, "...I'd always had charisma,drive, and stamina..."  Sounds like a GIFTED person to me! Hey folks, save your money, Think and Grow Rich is still a great read 
 I have to say I did not have too much faith to begin with that this was going to be a good movie.  However, the reviews I had read and the Blockbuster cashier all said it was a genuinely funny movie. My friends and I were ready for a good comedy. I suppose if you think that perpetual arguing and name calling and irresponsible behavior is hilarious then I suppose it could win an Oscar nomination.   Needless to say, I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen!  Ever.    I feel like Jennifer Anniston signed onto this movie to vent all her withheld emotions  about Brad and their disintegrating relationship/marriage.  And Vince Vaughn was portrayed as a big buffoon.  I felt foolish hanging in there as long as I did waiting for the tide to turn and the humor to begin. It never happened.  And I watched a good hour and a half.  They yelled at each other the entire time.  No joke.  I felt tense and contracted on the couch and none of my friends were laughing either.  I left before the ending but heard a bunch of groans coming from the living room so the ending was no better.    I cannot say I was disappointed, I simply felt foolish renting it in the first place and subjecting my friends to it.  I suppose the only good that came out of this rotten movie was that Jennifer and Vince found love on the movie set.  So in that case I give it one star.  
 The movie overall is really a great story; the quality of the DVD is what really is what I find as poor quality.  It's almost as though some one  copied it using a video camera recorder.  I already own a copy of the VHS tape and it is a far better version of the film.  The actors are classics.  I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers.  Ward Bond also.  There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering. 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 Despite the fact that CliffsNotes has helped me through one too many an English Lit quiz, I believe that this is taking it a little too far. Catcher in the Rye is, by far, one of my favorite books of all time, and to create CliffsNotes for it requires something less than academic foresight. Talk about not being able to see the forest for the trees. The entire point of J.D. Salinger's one and only published novel is that though we do need to carry out our schooling, education isn't there to cloak the mind into believing that regurgitating facts onto meaningless scraps of wood pulp. It's there to take the free thought that we have and expand it, so that we can better express ourselves, and not bury who we are behind a pile of textbooks. The specifics of the life of Holden Caulfield are not important. The generalities of the life of Holden Caulfield are not important. What is important is the ideals expressed in the book--not where Holden went to school, not how many times he mentions the hunting hat, not where the ducks do actually go. Both teachers and students of today must learn that teaching others and yourselves that this is all that's important is like building a wall around yourself. So read the book. It'll bring you to something closer to happiness than an A ever will. And hell, if you actually read the thing, you might ace it anyway 
 On the most important subject to homeschoolers---teaching beginning reading--the Moores give poor advice. Read page 107.  They advise you to be wary of "intensive" phonics but they don't define intensive phonics.  They say that young children who have problems with reading are usually "just not ready."  My experience has been that most such children have simply not had effective phonics.        The book's advice:  If you have a weak background in phonics go out and get a book or program.      The idea is repeated from prevous books that many bright children devise systems of phonics and other attack skills largely by themselves.  But a bright child might have got into useful reading much sooner had he been gently introduced to phonics.  And what if you wait and wait and your bright child never does figure out the complexity of word decoding.  Because the early years are so important to language acquistion, starting phonics two or three years later could limit the child's future potential and cause the parents (and child) much needless heartache and stress.      Don't, as the Moore's recommend, delay and wait for the light "to click on."  When the child can name the letters of the alphabet gently start teaching systematic phonics.  The bright students will move forward quickly, the slow ones will move slowly but none should experience failure if being taught by patient parents.         On page 105 he suggests "watching for opportunities" to teach.  As in teaching  the sound of o in oats.  Most experts would say teach the sound of oa in oats.     The book condemns "zealots" who rush little children into formal reading.  It says that development principles opposing this are as unchangeable as the Rock of Gibraltar.  OK, I don't want to "rush" my child.  My child wants to read.  Tell me how to do it gently!!      This reviewer was concerned only with Chapter Three of this book 
 A boring book that didn't illuminate much for me. The idea of writing a brief history of human progress is wonderful yet this book doesn't encompass enough and is at many times very boring. I wouldn't recommend it but I also don't have an alterative book to recommend on the subject 
 The type (copy) and the book itself are really small and hard to read.  It's more like a pocket size handbook.  I should have done more research before I purchased; I made the inaccurate assumption that art/design books are usually  larger in scale. I can't comment on the content of the book because the size of it was such an impediment I stopped reading after a few chapters. 
 I bought this album thinking it was a greatest hits compilation of Tim's Verve years. Instead, this seems to be a compilation of demo tapes. The audio quality isn't bad, but most of the cuts are a minute and a half long or so. Many have either very spare instrumention or odd ones, like string sections. Tim sounds fine, but if you're looking for the familiar versions of stuff on Tim Hardin 1-3 or so, forget it. This aint it 
 Tender Bar is a good to fair book but not even in the top 20 of books I have read this year. It falls into tedium. The first half is interesting but this novel just becomes dull and lacks focus 
 I was urged by my uncle to read this piece of conspiracy tell-all. I found it interesting to say the most but tossed it aside as fiction. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. However, it's very fun to read about our imminent  destruction because of the illuminati and their control over the world.  It's even very laughable when you read secret lists of people behind these  conspiracies that only Mr. Marrs has access to. If you want to believe that  we're all going to die soon and that the Great Tribulation is staring at us  straight in the face, sure, read this book- you'll have fun and probably be  convinced. But if you'd rather live out the remainder of your life in  peace, read this book and laugh 
 It appears that some of the information in this guide is dated. A travel guide is only useful if the information is up to date. 
 The old Stats Pro Football Handbooks used to be great when preparing for the upcoming fantasy football season. But the 2002 and 2003 editions are just lousy. Want to check on how bead weather or playing on a grass field affect Marshall Faulk's rushing stats? Don't look here. Want to check on O-line perofrmances vs. divisional opponents? Don't look here. Everything that used to be great about this book is now gone. All it lists are the usual statistics you can find in any magazine or website. What Stats has done to this formerly fine product is a crime 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 I agree with the premises of this book, but found it rather boring, and not the easiest to read. If you want to read something similar that doesn't read like a textbook, I would suggest "Losing Faith in Faith", "Atheist Universe" or "Like Rolling Uphill." 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 This book does a reasonable job to overview Reich's life and most of his early work, though it fails to be as thorough as for example Sharaf's "Fury on Earth". The author gives his impressions of Reich's work, a philosopher's discourse and comparative review of Reich's behavioral findings as they relate to modern ideas in psychiatry and psychology... and on that matter he does a reasonable job. However, what bothered me was the terrible misrepresentation of Reich's biophysical research. Corrington either does not know about, or knows but for some reason fails to discuss, the multitude of controlled studies undertaken both during Reich's lifetime and after his death, which have verified the more controversial aspects of his biological and orgone energy discoveries. So, for example, the reader will learn nothing about: 1) DeMeo's 1970s University of Kansas replication of Reich's cloudbuster research, showing positive results, nor DeMeo's global cross-cultural study "Saharasia" which used standard anthropological evidence to prove the global accuracy of Reich's sex-economic findings on the origins of violence. 2) The double-blind and controlled studies of S. Mueschenich and R. Gebauer at the University of Marburg in the early 1980s, "The Psycho-Physiological Effects of the Reich Orgone Accumulator", verifying exactly Reich's original findings on the human physiological response to the orgone accumulator. Also not mentioned, the additional replication study of the orgone accumulator by G. Hebenstreit at the University of Vienna. (both of these are fully cited in DeMeo's "Orgone Accumulator Handbook") 3) The large number of replication studies on the orgone accumulator's effects upon plants and cancer mice by Richard Blasband, Courtney Baker, Robert Dew and others as published in many articles in the Journal of Orgonomy, Annals of the Institute for Orgonomic Science, Pulse of the Planet and (German) Emotion journals, from c.1965 up into the present. 4) Replication studies on Reich's bions, as made by biologists from R. duTeil in France, who presented his results to the French Academy of Science in 1938, to B. Grad in Canada to Dew, Blasband, and a whole list of others who made replications of Reich's biogenesis and bion experiments -- none are mentioned except in a single passing footnote (p.280, n.10) The recent issue of Pulse of the Planet (subtitled "Heretic's Notebook") shows color photos of protocells and bionous forms well on the path to life made from completely sterile and previously "dead" preparations, following or building upon Reich's original protocols, by Grad, Snyder and DeMeo, equal to anything published by NASA in the nature of contemporary "origins of life" research. 5) Also not mentioned, clinical studies from German physicians, where "Orgone Accumulator Therapy" has shown dramatic help to cancer patients and against other immune-system disorders. Unlike the USA, where the FDA uses policemen and the courts to assure a pharmaceutical monopoly, in Germany the orgone accumulator has a legal status similar to acupuncture and homeopathy, as an accepted form of "energetic medicine" which is even recommended to the EU by the German government for harmonization of medical practices. And so on. Corrington is an academic, sympathetic to Reich, and so he should have dug into and explicitly reported on these matters. He also apparently got the ear of Roger Straus, head of Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishers, who is intimate with the Wilhelm Reich Museum and also claims to be sympathetic to Reich -- so both the author and editor are in the "Reich circles" sufficiently to know about these studies, or at least to have been asking some questions. Why are the "friends of Reich" so systematically oblivious to these facts, or unwilling to mention them in new books such as this one? I know for a fact, that Straus was approached to publish other books which gave these facts on Reich's biophysical work, but those books were politely refused.  Why?  Why is it that those who are interested in Reich's therapeutic work, often denigrate and ignore his biophysical work. Why? A half-dozen emails by author Corrington to senior researchers following up on Reich's work over the years would have provided him with an abundant list of such replication studies -- the orgonelab.org website has an entire lengthy "Bibliography on Orgonomy" online and available to anyone, with an entire separate list of citations to Reich's work and the many replication studies. Nearly none of it is mentioned in the Corrington book, save for the materials on Reich's early work. Why? This is a glaring omission, a "condemning with faint praise" of his later biogenesis, cancer and orgone energy discoveries, and it stands out like a sore thumb.  This book will help the dishonest "skeptics" to once again sit comfortably with their long-time disinformation and outright lies about Reich, which were responsible for his death in prison, for the burning of his books, and for the contemporary academic distortions and black-out on his important discoveries. This book will be a frustrating and upsetting read for those who know the facts 
 WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly. First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write. But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot. And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time 
 One listen to Nat King Cole's "The Christmas Song" will give any avid listener and Nat Cole fan an indicator of how badly EMI/Capitol remasters their vintage recordings.  Thanks to an overly heavy hand on the No-Noise, they've essentially stripped all of the ambiance and breath of life out of the music on this collection.  In instances where I have older CDs or vinyl, the sound on this collection is just stripped of life, and very antiseptic sounding; the originals just live and breathe more.  This might be OK for background listening, but anything louder than that, you notice that the music just doesn't sound *right*.  If you absolutely must have these songs, by all means buy this disc.  This and the other "Christmas Cocktails" volumes do have a great selection of claasic holiday tracks, even though the Lounge movement is far past its prime.  If song selection were my sole criteria, I'd have given the set four stars.  But given the sound quality, I dock it two stars.  EMI should know better, but they're so obsessed with ridding the music of all that nasty tape hiss that they destroy the essence of the music in the process.  
 Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare 
 i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is: does it help beat the races? the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing, which can only be done with software on a computer. i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books. the bottom line... yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet, indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public. to beat the horses you have to think outside the box. so in conclusion don't waste your time reading this book. 
 Tour de France: Companion 2005 implies that you will be getting a guide to the race for 2005.  If that is your expectation, you will be disappointed.  Of the 184 pages, almost 5 relate to this year's race in what is hardly more than cursory detail...  There are no profiles of the stages.  There are no individual stage maps.  There are no descriptions of the routes and the challenges they pose.  The authors, it is clear, have not taken the trouble to follow and scout this year's route.  They did not follow last years either would be my guess, nor will they next.    The cover of the book promises to provide a 2005 crib sheet.  If the reader expects to pass a test based on the promise of the crib sheet, he will get a failing grade.  Look elsewhere if you are interested in information regarding the current Tour de France 
 I thought this book was going to be a great Legal Thriller, but little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst book I have ever read. I expected a lot more out of Scott Turow, who wrote "One L", which I loved, but this book was plan boring. The begining started out slow and it never picked up from there! The worst Legal Thriller, ever 
 But had one of the  worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts?  For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!  Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers 
 While I found the reviews to be accurate, this book does not have a whole lot of selections compared to other books like Lonley Planet. 
 As a student I was excited to find so many new ideas in one place.  However, when faced with writing a review of the ideas in this book, I needed to review my finance and accounting texts.  If you want to be up on  the popular terminology read this book.  If you want to reinvent your  financial office look somewhere else 
 The print is very small for older eyes and the book was written many years ago.  The blueing and browning techniques of today are far easier and simpler to use. I would not recomend this book for reblueing modern firearms 
 Did you know that Eminems favorite song is #9 on the "MAKAVELI" album

 I read this book for a book club.  Although I did not enjoy it at all, and I would never read another one of her books, its was interesting to hear other peoples comments on it.  The majority enjoyed it.  I found her a very angry person, who uses her writings as therapy.  As she works her way around her problems, I just wanted to yell grow up and get over it.  Life is not perfect and neither are the people in it.  
 This book is a good idea. But there is room for litterature that can tell the same in a more lively way with far fewer words. ...or can tell four time as much with the same number of pages. - The language of most of the authors is such that you wonder WHY they have chocen to say what they attempt to tell in such flowery ways. After a paragraph it's hard to remember "What did he try to tell me now." It's easier to think: "Yes. I can see that you have learnt a hole lot of words, and adjevtives in particular." - I have found litterature about the same topic, put in a different language that manage to do this far better. In fact I've found public reports that with regards to the ability to convey a thought is far more readable 
 Our son loves loves loves his lunch box.  Is very excited to take it to school everyday.  But, everytime, it takes even the tiniest of tumbles, it cracks.  The thermos is also the same way....broke WAY too easily.  We still use both because we haven't had the time to replace....but we will have to replace it very soon...it is only a month old.  Needless to say, we'll be looking for a vinyl or tin lunch box this time around 
 I got one of these (the Sears Craftsman version) as a gift, so the price was right- otherwise I'd say it's overpriced.    The maximum volume is much too low to be used in a noisy environment. The handset is thick, so if you hang it from your belt, (upside down because of how the belt clip is attached)then you're going to scrape it off and have it fall to the floor. The keypad numbers are sealed, but the buttons themselves are very small.    If this is really a shop phone, then why isn't there some sort of bright flashing light that lets you know visually when a call is coming in? If you're wearing ear plugs, or running a noisy tool you'll never hear the ring.    I haven't found the extra battery to be necessary or usefull. I think it's just a gimmick to appeal to the "cordless tool" crowd. I'm sure that the "spare" battery won't last any longer than the one you leave permanently attached to the phone.    One supposed selling point for this phone is that you can put in a garage or shop where you have no phone line installed. You can do this because it comes with a transmitter/receiver unit that you can plug in anywhere in the house there's a phone jack. Don't try to use this phone very far from the trans./receiver unit because its range is pretty low.    I'm giving this phone only one star because it has some useless features, is missing several other necessary features, costs too much for what you get, and doesn't perform very well, ESPECIALLY considering it's billed as a specialized shop phone 
 New punk rocker Peter Hayes is now rich, thanks to the dude from Brian Jonestown Massacre who hooked him up with BRMC!!!!  What a great transition for Hayes!!  Now he leads the way!!!  BRMC writes catchy, fuzz-scratched rockers that get people jumpin' at the clubs.  The suits in the industry like these guys cuz they sell records by the truckload, but the kids like BRMC for more pure reasons - namely, da music!!!!  If you like the Warhols you'll also dig BRMC - it's a done deal!!!!!!!!!!! 
   I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in "You Got Served" and was extremely disappointed.  The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know.  The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video 
 In this book, I believe Paul Laurence Dunbar used fictional characters to protray his thoughts about how the black race was thought of in the mid-1990s. He was accalimed for his way of bringing concern to the topic of  racial discrimination through writing. The novel kept me interested, but  wasn't something to make a movie out of 
 To start off with, I want to say that I really loved Ilium, and had very high hopes for Olympos. But I was ultimately dissapointed. There are a number of flaws I found in the book, most of which I'll mention here.  Like another reviewer, I was hoping the focus of Olympos would be the war between the united Greeks and Trojans against the gods. To avoid spoilers I won't say much other than there is very little time given to this conflict, which I found very dissapointing.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book seems to build for a long time, to what the reader hopes will be some sort of epic intense conclusion, but ultimately there is barely a climax at all. Also, not all mysteries set up by the book are explained (though overall a great deal will become more clear, there are a number of unexplained bits that annoy me). Along with unexplained mysteries, there are a few points in which the motivations of characters do not make much sense.  Also, one specific conflict we are essentially promised at the end of Ilium, and is foreshadowed a number of times in Olympos, never actually occurs. The reader is supposed to accept that this sort of showdown will probably happen at some point after the events of the book.   Olympos also lacks the intensity and action of Ilium. I remember reading the last 300 pages of Ilium in one sitting because  I was so enthralled. Olympos never reaches this level. In fact, by the end I was already dissapointed enough that I practically had to force myself to finish it.  One final thing that bothered me were a number of anti-Islam and homophobic bits that really add nothing to the story. They were essentially purposeless, yet they were there. At one point near the end homosexuality is described as if it was just some psychological disease existing only in the 21st century. This passage comes from nowhere, and like I said, serves no purpose.   While I still think Ilium was an amazing book, this sequal did not come close to meeting its promise 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Very clear image! Probably the best that I saw on this kind devices! No software availble. Device is useless if You do not have Windows Media OS. Absolutely no Linux support. Good hardware... but useless... You have to buy software for ~$70-120 to be able use it... 
  Very disappointed by Canon on the fit of this adapter.  Adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows  
 If there was a prozac for books, this book would need a dose of it. Dumb, pointless plot. Dumb, pointless characters. A substandard effort from Pohl, who is one of my favorite authors 
 Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist's office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat. I started to have quite an anxiety attack, so I pulled over at the only available place. A Gas Station. Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body. Now this was no ordinary Gas Station. This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter, including supreme-pizza, chicken drum-sticks, and even breakfast-style food, like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. Sure, the food smelled alright, but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil, grease, or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. While I was peering over the counter, trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were, something to my left caught my eye.   It was a golden box of something called a "Powerbar". The name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power), and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. "I'm going to eat a POWERBAR" was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot. I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist's office.   I unwrapped one of the Powerbars. It looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide, and for how long? What kind of advantages would I gain? I thought I had found my new favorite food. Finally, a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person. That is, until I took my first bite.   My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor, with an atrocious after-taste. My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer's glue, and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead. I felt no extra power in my body. If anything, the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar, so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. By this time I was in the Dentist's parking lot. If I went in now, I could make the appointment on time, but I had to try for more Power. Big mistake. The second Powerbar was no different. It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach. I finished the second Powerbar, feeling even worse.   My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. It was a different flavor, and I nearly threw-up. I felt 20 pounds heavier. My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall, and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one, no matter how much I tried. It was time to go inside.   My dentist was a little ticked-off that I was late, and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. Apparently I wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. I felt sick for the rest of the day. I gave my dog (Morris) the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog, but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. Please beware, the name of this product is deceptive, unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful, and will overpower YOU. Later.   howardtuttleman.co 
 It's disturbing when a subpar VHS Dub ruins an otherwise decent movie. Why the dreaded "EP" mode is used for recording movies is beyond me. That tells me that quality is of no concern to the vendor, which in this case is Simitar Entertainment. I would be ashamed if I were selling these to unsuspecting customers--apparently they are not. SP should be the industry standard. Let's face it, if you are buying this movie, its because you want to see Jayne Mansfield. A good quality VHS is all anyone can ask for, and this isn't it 
 It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points:  1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected?   2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?  3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs?   4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women.   5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.  6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women.   7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.  8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.  This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction.  In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.  In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy?  The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation. Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart.  At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are 
 I found the book to be useless. Now granted, I expected more out of it and for it to be useful for someone who has /management/ experience, just not sales experience, but it was confusing, not very well written and generally targetted to someone whose never done anything beyond an entry level position 
 This is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read--with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics, much of what Hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible.  I also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being "post-human."  If you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition, with links to literature, read this.  If you don't really care about the post-human, skip it 
 I bought the base and two handsets 2 yrs ago, and one of the handset completely stopped working after 1.5 yrs. After a year, we replaced the rechargable battery in every handsets, but one of the handsets started loosing it's power very quickly (we charge for 6 hrs and it lasted for 10 minutes), and then stopped working. There's an ongoing class action lawsuit against the series KXTG and KXTC in NJ, and the law firm encourages every consumer, regardless of state, who had any problems with these models to fill out a questionaire at their website (they only ask for your name, email address, state, and comment). http://www.sheller.com/Practice.asp?PracticeID=140 
 Just completed a hiking trip to California, September 2004. I am a weekend hiker from Ohio. I was looking for a guide for the best hikes to take - FOR SIGHTSEEING. I thought that this book would lead me to the most scenic hikes in the Redwood area of Northern California. BIG MISTAKE. The point of my review is this: you CANNOT Trust this book to get you to the Best Hikes.  We did 5 hikes recommended in this Book. Two Costal Hikes, which were nice. THe book was helpful, and the rating Equitable.  We then did 3 hikes in Redwood Country. Two of his recommendations we a total bust, and a waste of TIME.  While the book has impressive reviews from newspapers and other sources, I offer my real world examples. It is my great disappointment in this book that has lead me to warn potential buyers. Not based on how it is written, but on my actual experience, IN THE FIELD, of going out, using the author's reccomendations, and hiking some trails.  1. Redwood Hike - Toumey Grove Trail Hike, rated a 9, at Richardson Grove State Park. What a joke. Nothing special about the hike. The Redwood Grove that you reach is very smallish, and not all that spectacular. Rest of the hike was nothing special either.  2. Redwood Hike - Rathert Grove Hike at Grizzly Creek State Park, rated a 10. Same story as above hike. We did speak with the camp host family, who directed us to the Cheatham Redwood Grove, several miles away, which was truly magical. This is where they filmed Star Wars, "Return of the Jedi." Not a lengthy hike, but this Grove of old Redwoods was truly magical, and the best Grove that we saw, espically after having just wasted TWO HIKES on Tom Stienstra's suggestions.  3. Redwood Hike - Prairie Creek State Park. While book lists one hike here, Fern Canyon, rated a 10, which we did - it was OK, he doesn't even mention the most magical, lengthy hike THERE. We did the James Irvine Trail, which was THE BEST REDWOOD HIKE that we did on our whole trip. We hiked the Irvine Trial to the Clintonia to Miner's Ridge, which brought us back to the Visitor's Center. About 4.6 miles of hiking through old growth, Costal Redwoods. This is another hike we would not have done, without the recommendation of the local camp host family.  4. Coastal Hikes - we did two mentioned in this Book. They were good. We did the Tomales Point Trail, at Point Reyes National Seashore - very nice, and the Bodega Head Loop, also very nice.  We began our trip in San Francisco, heading north, along the coast. We started off with a couple of coastal hikes that were nice. Once we got further north, to Redwood country, the hikes recommended were a complete waste. We had limited time, energy, and the hikes highly rated in this book were a complete disappointment. This became apparent when locals directed us to other, BETTER hikes in the area.  While this book is a decent resource for some basic trail information, you had better look to other books and resources to prepare for hiking in Northern California. When you only have a limited time in this part of California, you simply cannot afford the luxury of wasting time on crappy recommendations for hikes.  Does the book cover the whole state of California? Yes. Some good information? Yes. But after my experience with this book, I would NEVER recommend this book to any hiker, UNLESS it was the second or third source that they were going to use. Otherwise, you too may run the risk of hiking on "so-so trails," while missing some stunning beauty in the same area. That was certainly my experience with this book. What a shame 
 I was trying to duplicate HI-8 tapes and the ADS Tech Video Express USBAV-191-EF is not a viable solution.  It drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording.  The installation is buggy.  I ended up buying a Sony VRD-MC1 and am extremely happy with it 
 Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US 
 This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory. There may be worthwhile ideas here hidden beneath layers of obscurantist prose, but the game did not seem worth the candle 
 If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to "do what sells".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself.  
 In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century.  He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, "sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege," p-3.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.    The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language.  For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use "men" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text.  The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory.  Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want.  In conclusion the authors says that "this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.    One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example.  The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites.  Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity?  Do the authors review men and masculist literature?  Not so you would notice.  In addition, the feminist concept of "the patriarchy" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda.  A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.    Use of the concept of "the patriarchy" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus.  As Sam Keen says in "Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man," P-196, "Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of "patriarchy."  "Patriarchy" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall."  In The Masculine Reader, "the patriarchy" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.   A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed.  Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark.  You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism.  A better book real understanding of men is a serious need.   
 Even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product (as described), I still would have returned the item.  The mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it wasn't really suitable for the intended purpose 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good

 Bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me.  I like the story line and everything and it's pretty sad, but I wanted to see more fight scenes.  Don't get this movie is you are expecting action 
  Other Recommendations Instead of:   `Healing Back Pain Naturally' by Art Brownstein MD (he went through many years of back pain, including surgery. I liked the positive approach of the book and the variety of options from medical to herbal, etc)  `The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief' by Clair Davies  `The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook' by Martha Davis PhD, etc etc (I esp liked the chapter on Meditation, since they were easy and had a variety of ones to choose from to try out)  `Living Better Every Patient's Guide to Living with Illness' by Carol J. Langenfeld and Douglas E. Langenfeld  `Staying Well With Guided Imagery' by Belleruth Naparstek  `Validate Your Pain! Exposing the Chronic Pain Cover-Up' by Allan Chino, PhD and Corinne Dile Davis MD 
 First things first: I do think that the U.S. political system has many characteristics of a fascist state. For example, there is virtually no difference between the two political parties and we live in a society that is set up to meet the needs of a rigid corporate agenda. Furthermore, given the corporate domination of the media, political dissent is muted. Having said all of this, I was disappointed by this book because the author uses too many anecdotal and unprovable stories to back up his arguments. In addition, the writing style is too casual and this greatly diminishes the impact of this book. Overall, this book comes across as a series of unsubstantiated ramblings.  For anyone who is really interested in getting a well-researched analysis of the US political system read "Understanding Power" by Noam Chomsky 
 I was hoping to be proven wrong when my husband said, "You're buying the Corrs?  Prepare to be BORED!" but sadly, it was not to be.  It IS boring.  If you're looking for something mellow, bland and sleepy, this is your album.  If you're looking for dynamic modern Irish music, prepare to be disappointed.  
 Try as I might I just could not find humor in this book.  So many times I wanted to put this book down and walk away but I thought, "This must get better."  It didn't.  LaFlam's character is spiritual selfish and so many times I felt offended reading this book.  There are so many twists and turns in this book that it seems like a Christian version of the Jerry Springer show.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an enjoyable read, because for me it was not.  I apologize to the author for my harsh words, but I was very disappointed in this work 
 I get what he was trying to do here, but it was just excruciating to listen to.  I couldn't bare to listen to every song all the way through.  There were a couple of funny ones, but overall, I thought it sucked 
 My son loved this belt. It has fun gadgets, but they were hard to get on and off for a youngster. They have to fit in a hole and then slide. When playing, though, some items came off. On Halloween night, we lost the batarang holder which caused distress for our son. We had to retrace steps and never found it. If used with care, this is a great belt. 
 Rock Til You Drop is the quintessential screed every "hip"music journalist has against "Dinosaur Rock". Trouble is, he doesn't even examine his own facts.  He admits early on that "blame has to be laid at the feet of the boomers who continually support these over-the-hill acts" and then goes on to spend the rest of the book taking on Jagger and Townsend. But that statement begs the question: if people are willing to spend their money that way, Jagger and Townsend have a right to keep delivering don't they? We KNOW cigarettes are bad, but if no one bought them, Phillip Morris would be out of business. Also, Strausbaugh takes on-exclusively- the behemoths of 70s-FM radio.  OK, so REO Speedwagon sucks.  But what about Tina Turner? If he had had the guts to take on the "queen of rock an roll"'s crappy Euro-pop which makes up 90% of her concerts before tossing out "Proud Mary" I would be more inclined to give him some props.  Or how about the Temptations, touring with only one original member left? (Ok he gets points for taking on icon Patti Smith) Also, I find that people who hate  70s rock acts are really just reacting to the unbelievable overplayed-ness of "Classic Rock" Stations.  Imagine, just imagine, Zep, Floyd, or the Stones had never sold more than a couple 100,000 copies. (Hard I know, but just try).  They'd be worshipped like the Velvet Underground and Big Star. Still, the book is quite good for a laugh, but best taken with the proverbial grain of salt 
 I previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of House of Leaves, but after some thought, have decided to edit it.    House of Leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances, and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read.  One individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror.  Others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and couldn't put it down.  Now, I love a good horror story, and several people promised me that this was THE horror story to read. After suffering through long boring academic-style descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides, and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist, I failed to find the scary.  I looked and looked, but it just wasn't there.    Thus, I'm disappointed.   It isn't so much that I minded slogging through faux academic literature (although that in itself is annoying - how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project?!), but that I slogged through it looking for something that - for me, at least - just wasn't there.  So, if you want my opinion, the book isn't scary, and it's rather long and dry.  Even the supposedly frightening experiences of Johnny Truant, the tattoo artist, were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over.  Hence my previous title of "A handful of Ritalin and a pot of coffee couldn't make this readable...".    Do I really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses I only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement?  That's what it felt like 
 I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars... 
 'We are poor, because they are rich'. This book is the bible of the perfect latin american idio 
 There are some good pieces of psychological information in this book that could asssit in rounding out an already developed character. Also, if your character matches perfectly to one of the character types in this text, then you can be assured that you have a stereotype, which is good to know. The explanation of motivation for certain crimes is also informational and fairly intuitive.  Overall, the information is simplistic and incomplete even given the limited parameters of printed information(in the murder section, murder to specifically advance goals or cover a problem is not mentioned.) I found myself often saying, "but what about..."  While it is true that one cannot cover every piece of information in a given subject area, the reader should not be left guessing about the omission of information.  There was a particular page in the book that really got under my skin as a psychologist and a woman. Her explanation of how "we" see heroism as adventure-seeking and risk taking (and "we're" wrong!) She goes on to explain how to define heroism (a good definition) and how once we do that, women outnumber men in the number of heroes.  It demonstrates a subtle theme running throughout the text that got under my skin.  She assumes an attitude is widespread (poor definition of hero;) and that women are better (once we redefine, women outperform men.)  I shall keep this on my reference shelf for occasional perusal.  
 Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc.  This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet, legal or illegal.  There's no rhyme or reason to the collection, and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them.  The source show is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has produced in some time.  It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather, the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996, say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance.  Avoid at all costs.  Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you find their 'classic' song on online...for free 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 Ummm... yeah this movie sucked. I mean come on, zombie cows? This movie had really bad special effects, even worse acting, and most of all it was just retarted. This lady even took her high heel shoe off and threw it at a zombie and  impaled its head. I know its a zombie movie and its not suppose to be realistic, but a high heel shoe? The only reason that you should rent this is because there is this short movie the director made that also sucks, but in a funny way. So, if you are super bored, go rent it and make fun of it. If you are just looking for a good zombie movie, keep looking. after watching this movie I actually think I've becaome brain dead. 
 Whatsoe'er word that Penrose has written, THAT word shall I read.  For it is my solemn duty to imbibe the ideas of another person, and come to grips with them.  This I style philosophy.  Thank goodness I have Rog' to "argue" for a "philosophical position."  And of course there will be lots of people arguing against him.  They will all be jostling around like stock-brokers on the floor of the exchange, waving little slips of paper, sweating, grimacing, their  faces a gray screen with hustler faces moving across it.  But lets see, let me furrow my brow and adopt a serious expression when the words "Physicalism" and "Mentalism" are bandied.  Let me puff on my pipe and say "Hmmmm" at irregular intervals.  Let me hear mention of John Searle with a straight face.  For this is the stuff of life.  
 This "book", if you can call it that, is a waste of money.  It would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it.  Instead, I would recommend Harry S. Dent Jr.'s book, "The Next Great Bubble Boom."  Both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn, but the Dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it 
 this cd is really good and boasts many talents, but...like the old gloria record ep, it gets old. if you've never heard this kind of music before, then get it by all means. but if you know of mineral, you'll probably like mineral better. it sounds a lot like u2 and radiohead. i see them live a lot, and basically, i've been disappointed lately. i used to think their music meant something to them. the last time i saw them in austin, they looked bored. i don't know...maybe the boys will cook up something new with their new music. let's hope so 
 Vogue Knitting does not have customer service, strange as it sounds. I've bought subscription through Amazon and received 1 issue; I since moved to another state and all my magazines followed me except Vogue Knitting. All pleas, e-mails and other attempts to communicate with magazine failed - its been over 6 months and 2 missing issues and I still dont have my magazine; probably won't. On the other hand, why would Vogue Knitting worry about lonely subscriber whose money they long spent 
 Not only is Ziggy Stardust among the best rock albums ever made and a work of art to last the ages it is also one of my desert-island discs.    I actually am not too bothered about there being 2 discs and I actually wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a well-designed and well-packaged overall cd.  Although I like the overall design concept of a booklet the way it's done here, they totally screwed up when they tried to execute the plan.    Firstly, they have to redo this with more hardy cardboard or paper as it's really easy to tear this package apart.  I'm actually afraid to read the liner notes for fear the whole thing will fall apart.  Secondly, they have to make it easier to remove the cds without scratching them.  Otherwise, the liner notes in booklet form is actually quite good.    Now for the really bad news: they have to do a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER job of remastering the first disc.  The first track starts out very soft and actually sounds muddy with each passing track until it reaches the tour de force and my favourite track, "Ziggy Stardust" where it sounds like it could actually have been remastered before ending with a whimper.  What a shame and to actually call this a 30th anniversary edition!    Ironically, the 2nd disc is much more interesting and actually some of the tracks sound like they had been really well remastered.  So what if you can get some of the tracks on the Ryko Disc version which I fortunately also own, the other tracks are quite good and it was nice to hear Bowie do a version of the old Chuck Berry standard, "Reelin' and Rockin'".    Perhaps they should have let the guy who remastered disc 2 do disc 1 as well.  Actually, the Ryko disc version which isn't advertised as a remastered disc sounds a whole lot better than disc 1.  Perhaps they should have designed a more robust packaging and let Ryko do the cds.    I'd really like to see them try again with my above suggestions.  Of all the "sins" they've done, surely the mediocre quality of disc 1, the main course, has to be the most mortal.  What a shame 
 It seemed like it took for ever for Carr to get around to his point. There was a lot of self promotion for a message that most of us implicitly understand. Perhaps a short essay would hav been best for this approach to stopping drinking. There are probably much more useful books out there for this difficult subject 
 I found this book to be more high tech than possible for the average reader to understand.  It was not helpful at all 
 I had reservations about Redfield's Celestine Prophecy, so didn't bother with The Tenth Insight.  But having some experience with Shambala (note spelling), decided to give The Secret of Shambhala a try.  Sorry, but it seems to me to be made up partly of some genuine worthwhile knowledge (which, however, is pretty common knowledge anyway)and partly--or mostly--of a humonguous bunch of buzzwords and buzz concepts--a lot of New Age-type stuff. A very thin read, and Redfield's style is basic English, which I suspect is used to facilitate quick translation in "the world's languages," but which I find most offputting in what purports (I think) to be a serious work.  I had hoped to find a connection in this book, but quickly came to the conclusion that Redfield's Shambhala truly is pure fiction.     
 Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase.  
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 I thought that this book has some good facts but on the other hand, It had a really unrealistic feel to it. It sounds like the author, lives in a fairyland world far from what is really happening. I really did not enjoy the book and was very unhappy with the author's job on writing it 
 This book reads as if it were written in one marathon sprint, the plot racing from one bloody event to the next, with barely a pause for character development or background detail.  What could have been an intriguing novel of mercenary killers and political upheaval is instead a throwaway pulp crime novel 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 I was very disappointed to open this book and find very bad quality illustrations. For $24 I would expect better than this. The illustrations, which are mostly stills from the movie, are about the same quality as newspaper photos from 40 years ago---very low contrast, mostly gray tones. This ruins what should have been (and sounded like) a good book. I take issue with the previous reviewer who said it has "improved scans". If this is the improvement, I'd hate to see what they looked like before. Any book about movies that features Metropolis will have far better quality stills from  the movie than this book.  Metropolis is one of my favorite films, and its influence can still be discerned today. Moreover, it is a political metaphor for class divisions that grow ever deeper in America. As long as there is a ruling class and an underclass this movie will stay relevant. Your money would be better spent on the excellent DVD of the fully restored film than for this disappointing book 
 I purchased this book, based on the author's history of writing good stuff.  This book is worse than porn.  I was so tired of all the graphic sexual escapades that I stopped reading it about a quarter of the way through and actually threw the book in the rubbish.  Sorry 
 I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.   I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.   That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.   Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.   (1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book "Don't Play In the Sun" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the "Mulatto Follies" of BET and MTV is priceless.   (2) "The Bluest Eye" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.   (3) "Flesh and the Devil" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.   (4) "The Color Complex"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.   (5) "The Darkest Child" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the "color code". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking like Tangy Mae and that spoke volumnes. This book is a very real metaphor for what goes on. Very real.   
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 Reading this book is like attending a required college class and being forced to listen to the Ivy League educated professor soar into flights of rhetoric on his personal pet theory arising from a somewhat obscure historical event. He uses language no human utters in real life, like "plebiscitarianism" and "intertemporal synthesis."  He, with a straight face, cites the New York Times as an example of a present day "impartial voice."  On substantive grounds, Professor Ackerman's view is almost uniformly positive as to Jefferson and negative toward John Marshall. While I admire many things about Thomas Jefferson, I think Chief Justice Marshall was a very great American and believe accepted history is on my side. The professor's general theory seems to be that blockheads drafted the Constitution and that only blind luck has kept our country from spinning into Latin American-style political disorder. While it is not stated overtly, the book is clearly aimed at presenting a constitutional analysis that argues against the current thinking of such jurists as Justice Scalia 
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 At first this thing was great, in 20 minutes (not 15) it would charge the batteries.  The problems came later when batteries started showing up as "bad" according to the charger, even brand new ones.  A few at first then a lot more.  I have other travel chargers that would charge the "bad" batteries over 8 hours and they would work fine.  Often after this the Energizer charger would charge batteries previously identified as "bad."  After about a year I discovered that the charger was destroying the batteries.  New and old, they would end up bad after a few cycles through this charger, so that even the slow chargers would not charge them.  Many times the charger would not charge them at all, just wait 20 minutes and turn green as if they were done.  Not good when you discover dead "charged" batteries while taking pictures on vacation.  I'd recommend going with slower chargers, inconvenient as they are.  The super fast charge time has destroyed a few dozen expensive NiMH batteries.  I'm looking for one that'll charge a dozen at once....if they make one that is 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 I agree with the previous reviewer - the belt clip works fine overall.  However, I dinged the product way more b/c you have to remove it EVERY time you want to turn your Shuffle on or off.  It would be one thing if it were every time you needed to charge the Shuffle or reload songs (which you also have to do), but this is twice every single time you want to use your Shuffle, which for me is 4 or 5 times a week.  That's just not practical.  Frankly I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't consider that when they designed the belt clip, and I wish I had known about it before I bought it 
 After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts. I would suggest that prospective purchasers of Belkin products hesitate before buying.. It's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly, but it's really frustrating when Product Support is worthless 
 Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation 
 I must say, selling a dated book like this when you're talking about Websites is a shame.  Sure some ideas might be timeless but this book uses poor example after poor example to make its point.  I read another web book called "Don't make me Think" just before this one.  I guess it would be like following Elvis with a kindergarden play.  Save your money.  Need I say more. 
 Let me first say that once upon a time I liked Larry The Cable Guy.  After reading this book, I now think he is one step above slime. To be fair, some jokes ARE funny and some stories ARE enjoyable and amusing.  He is anti-PC which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Barney Frank, Barbara Streisand, and "that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks", among others.  No problem there in my opinion. That is the entirety of the positive things I can say about the book.  The rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that even Larry lovers will find annoying.  A couple things that really bothered me.  The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of "retards" and Down's Syndrome children.  He must use the term "retard" at least fifty+ times in the book.  This is appreciably different than making a joke about, say, Michael Moore.  Moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes.  The Down's Syndrome children did not. My opinion of Larry The Cable Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on "retards".  He also racially sterotypes in the book.  Many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond.  The Down's Syndrome kids can't.  Larry, I can only hope God (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a "retard" child to love and care for.  Then, I would like to read your next book. I suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly.  The second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many senses.  He plays the good 'ol Bubba. He ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm.  His "celebrity" - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. OK, Larry. Why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion?  Why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down?  Why the unrelenting references to your "celebrity"?  The terms "meet and greet" and "after-party" were used over and over and over, as an example.  Do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are?  Well, you are wrong.  They are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become.  That's Hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend.  Overall, this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable Guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than "retard").    My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb people.  Those who are dumb and know they are dumb.  And those who are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it.  The former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb).  The latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. The first group is obviously smarter than the second.  Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group.  The fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. Make jokes, Larry, and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like.  Unfortunately, Larry can't see the obvious.  Like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of them.  A thin layer of "Good 'Ol Boy" on top, covering a core of venom and "celebrity". He plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets.  My suggestion: Don't buy Larry's act and, by all means, don't buy the book.   
 I have recently read 5 books about the Trappists/Cistercians and this is the worst book of them all.  I have spent 10 days on retreats at a Trappist abbey and more to come, and I DO NOT recommend this book for several  reasons.  First, the author has approached his subject as a journalist and  has a negative tone.  Secondly, he has included too much autobiographical  information about his own life and spiritual struggles.  Thirdly, he has a  rather arrogant attitude about his desire to invade the privacy of some of  the monks who choose not to be interviewed by him.  Lastly, his tone is  that of one being perched "on-high" and gazing down upon the lives of the  Trappist monks.  For a much better introduction to Trappist/Cistercian  monasticism: The Silent Life, By Thomas Merton; The Cistercian Way, By  Andre Louf; Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire, By Michael Downey; and  The Orchards of Perseverance, By David Perata.  I believe that these other  titles are much more accurate in portraying the spirituality and practice  of Trappist monks 
 I liked the world that was portrayed in this book a lot, and I thought that it was done pretty well.  But I have to say that some parts of the book just didn't make sense to me, and bits and pieces of the plot and the characters seemed to morph unexpectedly.  People would remember certain parts of conversations, and not other, critical parts, which confused me to no end.  I wasn't sure if it was a mistake, or if the characters were supposed to actually have forgotten.  I also was disappointed by the lack of depth in the story overall - the setting was really rich, but the characters and the plot were pretty predictable and I saw every twist coming way ahead of time - so much so that I thought the author must be setting me up to be shocked, but the shock never came.  I did enjoy the book, and will read the next two, but I'm hoping that the following books will be more creative in terms of plot and that the characters will become more easy to relate to and like 
 I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.  
 This new avengers book is more of marvels great line of crap.  If you have any apperation of any of the heroes in this book don't get involved with it.  They ruin the image of wolverine. he gets his butt handed to him by Spider Woman.  NOT Cool.   When will marvel get their act together.  Stay away from this one 
 Simple is definitely the word to describe this book. The photography is gorgeous and the pictures take up most of the space.But the projects are contrived and poorly explained for beginners. A mix of retro hippie/today's young hip designs. There isn't one project that interests me nor is there any inspiration to be taken from these designs. I expect better books from Interweave Press. This one is a disappointment. I gave the same review for Color on Color by the same author 
 ... and I didn't even get paid for it... despite the director's (ulli) promises. So - maybe that's a measure of how bad a production it was...? But I thought I'd get this out to the public - just let people know what sort of production and director this is... I played the computer hacker. (it was fun to do, though! - and I'm not even an actor! 
 I think this book would be much more appreciated by experienced sailors.  As an armchair enthusiast with only a small amount of sailing knowledge I was quickly bogged down with all of the technical jargon.   I never got that feeling of being "there" and identifying with the people and the crises that I had hoped for 
 As a student of cinema and history, I am amazed at the attention this book on the popular Indian cinema has been able to garner. The book is full of such obvious howlers as for instance the translation of BR Chopra's "Naya Daur" as not the "New Epoch" but as the "New  Race". It seems that the writer has been somewhat overwhelmed by the  rural tonga race included in the film. I wonder if, with that kind of  understanding of the broadly "Hindustani" language, it is really  possible to write the kind of seminal film and cultural study that this  book is being so unabashedly advertised as by the likes of Robert Stam and  the OUPs of this planet. Having gone through the book I have been able to  find at least 71 similar mistakes. Just because India is far off and  Hindustani an unknown quantity, one doesn't have to jump to Ms  Chakravarty's defence 
 ...not much more...for us, at least.  we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors!  but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby.  we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and "breast friend" sling much better.  sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling.  ;- 
 Part of our Christmas tradition is watching "Merry Chritams Mr. Bean." Unfortuantely, this DVD includes only part of that classic episode. It's back to the VHS "Merry Mishaps of Mr. Bean" for another Christmas. How disappointingly analog 
 I must confess I do not care for Dostoyevsky and this is probably his weakest and least probable book.  This is the book that he wrote as a kind of apology for having once been a revolutionary.  While I can agree that the people who populate this book are scoundrals and this probably is accurate, the ending is just horrible.  Here we have the old revolutionary, "People's Will" stalwart marching through the snow having been discarded by everyone and on his deathbed crying out for the gospels.  I just did not buy it and do not think anyone really can suspend disbelief to do so either 
 Our book club all read this as our first Ian Mcewan book.  It was so short that the exact history/relationship of the couple is never established.  You don't know enough about the couple to care much about them, so the ending seems disturbing as it comes out of nowhere and seems to be the ONLY interesting thing to happen in the book.  
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 This book requires the reader to know lots of stuff in math like partial diff equations etc. Maybe good for mathematicians and comp scientists but certainly not for beginners 
 This author show's himself to be racist and oblivious to Star Trek's main theme: i.e. not just inclusion of all races and species but taking delight and enjoyment in each person's differences. The meaning of the term I.D.I.C. first used in the original series.  Star Trek made ground-breaking statements about race and race relations in the 60's and some of it's ideas about it have become the norm in our society. Because the show's later incarnations do not seem to be screaming diatribes against  society this author apparently considers Trek to be a "sell-out."  Apparently since the phenomenon that is Star Trek isn't obsessed with Victim studies and doesn't dwell on injustices hundreds of years in it's past and is instead concerned with a future in which everyone is included it represents a "white future."  Apparently accepting all races, creeds, and even species is a "white future."  Whatever "future" Star Trek represents, let's hope that one day we here on Earth are lucky enough to enjoy just a sliver of that future's acceptance, cooperation, even indifference to race.  Until "victim studies" experts like Daniel Bernardi drop their continued insistence on the long dead past, people who consider themselves to be of different races(there is no such thing - scientifically it's all climate adaptation - there is, in truth, only one human race) those ignorant enough to only see themselves through the miopia of race will never accept one another as well as envisioned in Star Trek's future 
 Its unfortunate that freedom of speach also allows authors such as this to completley fabricate and slander an entire culture.  There has been documented scientfic evidence of the fabrications that substantiated human sacrifice and the so called god theory.  The reality is, europeans LACKED the understanding and knowledge that would allow them to comprehend the indigenous cultures they encountered.  Their belief system was so different, that they saw EVIL where there was none.  To this day there has been NO archeological or scientific PROOF of sacrifices.  This book is nothing more than a good piece of fiction 
 The usual anti tradition garbage. Little biography here more of a thesis of liberal pope=good pope traditional pope=evil pope. Bad biography, any real church historian knows John XXIII never wanted the garbage that happend after vatican II i.e. he never even wanted a mass in the vernacular. If you like real catholicism and beauty ( or for that matter are looking for a bio of John xxiii) then skip this book, If you want a book about why churches should continue to look like empty garages and homilies should be given by a butch nun about how we need to call jesus she then this ones for you 
 This book is almost identical to the Spring developer's guide available on the web site.  They follow the same chapters and format, and provide little new information, maybe some code.  But once you start to get into Spring and use it, you'll want a reference that is more in depth.  With this book, you'll find yourself struggling to find the details by browsing google and javadocs all day.  Pro Spring is a better book that gives you more insight into how Spring works.  My background is providing a services interface layer for a J2EE portal.  I'm not developing the MVC so I didn't pay attention to those parts of the book 
 This book will apeal only to the phantom of the opera phans who have the misfortunate of being exposed to nothing more then the sub-par recent movie and have not read any talented continuational writing. The flaws go further then the characterization however. The languages used, alterations in accents, and general ridiculousness of the situations would mortify any self respecting phanatic. It is admitted in the foreward that little experience as a phan is had by the author and no previous writing experience. This shows in the writing style itself, with constant repeatition of the word "lad" and constant ending of sentances with unnecisary exclaimation points. The book gives only the briefest surface skimming of simple minded thought processes that in no way do justice to the character this book is suposedly written about. Take some more writing classes my dear author, in style, continuity, and characterization, and in years from this point you yourself will CRINGE at this juvenile and pathetic work. ~A True Phan 
 I enjoy reading about Laura Ingalls and her family and was anxious to read this book as well.  But I soon became disappointed quickly when the author decided to put sexual overtones into relationships between father and  daughter and cast the mother as a predjudiced servant who followed her  husband around like a dog.  She mistankenly tried to explain the roles of  the family in a 20th century feminist viewpoint, but it failed horribly.   For example; in LHOTP, when Pa and Ma were raising the walls of the house,   she seemed to write how Ma wasn't capable of raising the walls with heavy  logs. " Obviously,  a woman who participates in building courts  disaster."  What the author fails to realize is that logs are  extremely heavy for any person, let alone a woman and the simple  explanation is that Ma just could not lift such a heavy item.  I highly  doubt Pa thought that women bring bad luck and ruin any project that  involve them.  My advice to the author is that if you are going to write a  book about a 19th century family, you can't think like a 20th century  feminist 
 Touted as the "missing manual" I was expecting good guidance on concrete applications.  I bought the software with the primary intent of converting various large Excel files into a database. The manual is large on theory and small on concrete help. My efforts to convert Excel files failed so often that I finally gave up trying.  The book was of no help. 
 This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well. 
 There is not enough teaching on Hell.  How can you talk about knowing God with out full-blown explanation on the nature of eternal damnation and hell.  It's impossible.  J. I. Packer fails in a great way 
 Being the action packed sequel to Jumanji, Zarthura follows the same feel as its predecessor, with even a title mention to the board game Jumanji mentioned in the book. Two feuding, young brothers, Walter and Danny, encounter a board game, Jumanji in the woods as they are wrestling around. Not until they get home do they realize there is another more "adult" game tucked inside.  Danny, the younger of the two, unknowingly starts a chain of space travel events by rolling the dice.  Eventually, normalcy is restored when Walter rolls the dice and is sucked through a black hole back in time before the game is found.  A distinct theme of slowing down and appreciating your family is found.  Allsburg uses his distinct artwork once again in this book. 	I was disappointed with the book.  While it was a good book, and a cool idea, I felt like it was too much like Jumanji to really enjoy.  The artwork had the same feel.  The story line was similar.  It was just too much alike for me to like.  
 i have to say i was sorely disappointed in this book... the subject sounds extremely interesting but after trying painfully to work my way through the first chapter about the discovery of fire i realized very quickly mr. crump has a very confusing, unorganized style of writing...   the first chapter talked about fire, its discovery and applications about 10% of the time... the rest of the chapter was filled with completely unrelated and confusing tangents into linguistics, the developement of mathematics, religion, astronomy and everything but fire which was supposed to be the main theme of the first chapter...   mr. crump also has a very annoying tendency to write run on sentences lumping several discrete ideas together so that by the time you get to the end of the sentence you don't remember what it was supposed to be about... also, when he does manage to stick to a single theme in the sentence he becomes verbose and again throws you off...  i can't believe someone so educated and privileged to have met so many important people in his life, to have seen so many incredible things would be so inept at communicating this to the reader... i'm a physician and read profusely... and unfortunately this has been one of the poorest pieces of scientific writing i've ever read... i'm glad that i only spent about seven dollars on it...  try again mr. crum 
 I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.  Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck! I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table 
 The book on Kennedy -- also called "A Matter of Character" -- is a stronger volume.   He finds some of the many flaws in Kennedy and examines them carefully.   Here we have a president who has nothing BUT flaws and Kessler is admiring throughout.    What is he thinking?      I gave it an extra star for its attempt to do the impossible -- that is, to paint an admiring portrait of Little George.   If you've seen the final scene of "Pink Flamingos," you will have no trouble swallowing this.  
 The book," The International Jew," a collection of articles, portents to present a scientific analysis of a problem, both the problem is stated and defined by the Author. The book is clearly aimed at an audience that neither requires, seeks, nor needs any substantiation of statements or claims made regardless of how devastating their effects may be on the affected.  If these articles had been submitted to a scientific body for publication, they would have been rejected out-of-hand being devoid of any Bibliography or References, making it impossible to verify any of the statements. However, even without this reference material, the contradictions found in this text are so obvious that it is impossible to view it as a serious undertaking.  To be specific, on page 8 it is stated:  "The single description ...of Jews ...is this: he is in business. It may be only gathering rags and selling them, but he is in business...the Jew is supremely gifted for business." And on page 14: "...wherever they [the Jews] wandered, the center of business seemed to go with them."  Yet on pp 33-34 one finds: "Associated with Columbus in the voyage were at least five Jews. Luis de Torres, interpreter; Marco, the surgeon; Bernal, the physician; Alonzo de la Calle. and Gabriel Sanchez. The astronomical instruments and maps which the navigators used were of Jewish origin." Of the surgeon and the physician only the first names are known. How, then was their religion ascertained? In fact, how and from whom was any of this information obtained? Here we have an Interpreter, a Jew; a Surgeon, a Jew; a Physician, a Jew; and the Navigational Instruments and Maps all made by Jews. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE IN-BUSINESS JEWS?  Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Surgeon to be found turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Physician to be found also turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Interpreter to be found turned out to be another Jew? And in all of Spain, makers of Navigational Instruments and Maps, all turned out to be Jews?  Did the Surgeon sail with Columbus because he was planning to peddle surgical instruments to the ship's crew? Did the Physician come aboard to push cough syrup and band-aids at exorbitant prices, having captive consumers at his mercy? And the Interpreter, did he arrive with a truckload of dictionaries counting on making a huge profit from selling these books to the sailors who had money in their pockets and no place to spend it?  Or would it be more reasonable to assume that, for a voyage of this gravity, Columbus picked the very best he could find. Now, if that is the case, then it would appear that the "supremely gifted [Jew] for business" turns out to be equally supremely gifted for Languages, Surgery, General Medicine, and the Manual Skills required to create navigational instruments and maps.  Perhaps one other example may prove to be of interest. In this book there are drawn constant comparisons between Jew and Gentile when no comparison on this basis is possible. Whether one considers a Jew a member of a specific race or a specific religion or both, a Gentile is neither: He is not the member of a specific race or the member of a specific religion and, obviously, he cannot belong to both of them. From the point-of-view of a Jew, a Gentile is anybody who is not a Jew. From a Mormon's point-of-view, anybody who is not a Mormon is a Gentile, which leads to the interesting and perhaps even amusing conclusion that from a Mormon's point of view, A JEW IS A GENTILE!  Last, but by no means least, once it becomes clear that the "The International Jew" is based on "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the need for proving discrepancies disappears. For decades now a number of independent Historical Scholars have shown that "The Protocols ..."are fictitious minutes of meetings that never took place.  Since a Theory based on an erroneous Hypothesis is an erroneous Theory, therefore, a book or series of articles, based on a fictitious account, consequently is itself a fictitious account of the 2nd order.  One may ask, how is it possible that so many have taken these statements for GOSPEL. The only answer I have to offer is this: " There are none so blind, as those who do not wish to see!" There are none so deaf, as those who do not wish to hear! 
 I had great expectations of this book but the more I read the worse it got. For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of 
 The author takes her same personal approach. Leaving one to wonder the "true" meaning behind her books. She only focuses  on Norse and Christian symbols. (Well, Greek too). I've read her other books as well and I'm growing tired of the same underlying negative tone regarding men. However...there is something about her that I like...I'll keep her books and refer back to them at later date. Maybe my feelings will change 
 This is exactly what I DONT like about KMFDM's new sound--I sure hope this is not the singer from MDFMK, because I liked that singer, but this chick sounds like that newer vocalist from Pigface--boo--thumbs down! 
 I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone 
 LA confidential is awesome, but I can't really see the logic in packaging it with a bunch of mediocre "hits".  City of Angels is not a good movie, and a perfect murder lacks any depth whatsoever.  Contact is interesting, but too slow to hold much interest.  Don't buy this gift set, instead, pick out the movies individually....LA confidential being the best 
 Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media.  This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot.  Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2.  The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.  All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment.  For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 Having read books 1-6, I can confirm that these History books are quite terrible. Often events are told out of order, especially in the stories of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The faulty chronology is very confusing when reading the books. Furthermore, the series are intended for elementary or middle school students, and making it available for such a wide spectrum makes it seem very condescending for those at the higher age range. For example, when describing latitude and longitude, she says to think of the world as a big fat man with a belt around his waist (i.e. the equator). Hakim weaves multi-culti fables, saying that the Americans got their ideas about what to put in the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation from the Iroquios League. That is absurd. Our system of government is based off of Athens, the Roman Republic, English law (minus that whole monarchy business), the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. She states that "some historians" think there may have been as many as 75 million indians (beg pardon, "The First Americans") pre-Columbus, but fails to give a bottom estimate, giving the impression that Europeans wiped out all the Amerindians. All in all, the books are inaccurate, misleading, and demeaning 
 This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess 
 As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.  The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration. 
 I've got to disagree with the other reviews -- the series has been fun to read up until now, but it stagnates with this book. The author has stretched a one book story over two books. This book consisted of the following sections: 1) Riker and his dad do not like each other 2) Dr Crusher is trying to solve the medical issue 3) Riots on the planet 4) Picard doing nothing  Repeat, repeat, repeat......my advice if you're reading the series but not a die-hard trekkie, skip the Love/Hate books and move on 
 First of all, if you haven't read the rest of the "Gridlinked" series, don't bother, this novel will be utterly incomprehensible to you. Most of the major plot points are set up in earlier books, and all (ALL) of the characterization of the major characters is set up in earlier books, leading them to drag around in this book like so many paper mache' characters. The new characters are drawn well, but it's assumed you already know the old characters, so they're just shoved around like chess pieces.   Neal Asher has written a lot of good stuff, but this one is, at best, merely readable. Buy it only if you've read the previous books in the Gridlinked series and want to see how he ties up all the lagging plot points. Sorry, Neal 
 Roth can be an amazing stylist, but this book lacks any sense of forward motion, and precious little suspense about the past.  Mickey Sabbath is obsessed with his dead Croatian sex-goddess mistress, and with sex in general, and the book explores his sexual escapades (mostly in the past, but some ick-factoring fantasies in present too) in microscopic detail.  This might be acceptable if it was leading to enlightenment or some kind of catharsis, but if it's intended to be there, it eluded me.  When Mickey masturbates on her grave, for example, his release isn't more profound merely because apparently, he's not the only ex-lover of hers to do so.  It's as if Portnoy aged but never matured.  Mickey is on the outs with his wife, and ruined that relationship partly with a dalliance with a student that came to life when the tape recording the student made of their erotic phone calls finds its way into the university's hands.  perhaps this is meant to comment on some of the "sexual harassment" excesses of the nineties, but it's so implausible, it doesn't wash, and seems to be little more than an excuse for a tour-de-force reproduction of that recording printed side-by-side with a scene of Mickey and student.  Mickey is a retired puppetteer, and his first wife was his muse.  she disappeared mysteriously long ago.  This thought nags at Mickey like a scab, but it is never resolved for the reader.  Sometimes Mickey claims to have murdered her.  There's no reason to believe this, but there's no alternative either.  The book goes on and on episodically:  Mickey throws himself on the mercy of an old friend, but is kicked out when he attempts to seduce the wife, and also, is found sniffing the panties of the daughter whose room he is staying in.  Just because the rants of a dirty old man are described vividly, without holding back, doesn't make them somehow emblematic of the human spirit.  Roth fails to turn these details into something universal and worthwhile.  It's a long book that just never catches fire.  I suspect it won its various awards because the judges didn't know what to make of it and didn't want to be considered prudish.  There's no "there" there, no story to reflect upon...  As always, there are some lovely passages.  Roth writes vividly and is often funny.  It would have made a good novella or collection of stories, but as a novel, it sprawls in its own flab 
 Joseph Campbell wrote "The Hero With 1000 Faces," arguably one of the most influential books of the 20th century.   Christopher Vogler wrote "The Writer's Journey," which might have been renamed "The Hero With 1000 Faces For Dummies."   Now James Frey has written "The Key," which might be renamed "The Writer's Journey For Dummies."  The only thing you will find in this book that is not in the previous books is countless directions to read Frey's "How To Write A Damn Good Novel," and other "Damn Good" books.  Do yourself a favour and read Campbell and Vogler instead 
 I hated this book! It was so off in so many ways. Nothing about it was interesting. A baby parade? Okay. *yawn* The only part I liked was when they were in the parade and had to be thoroughly humiliated. That part was a little amusing at least 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 A glowing ball of weird light that turns people evil.  A computer in love with its creator.  Two people go into a hyperspace pod, one comes out pregnant.  Sphere meets Knight Rider meets some bizarre Star Trek episode.  Waste of time, unless its late night television, even then, try not to think, or you'll be very disappointed 
 I saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you!  However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one 
 This book is not what the cover appears to indicate - although ording online, it was the title more than the cover that attracted me to it. Sure it has some sections on restoration - which to me indidcates retouching, but a lot of it is about photo illustration.  Very well explained and well put together, this small book shows a good representation of some of the ways one can integrate photos that result in something that is nigh impossible in one shot alone.   The book covers restoration, body manipulation, sky and contrast fiddling, montages, photo art and commercial artwork. The problem with this book is each chapter is different from the rest. I see no need to have all of these together, rather split them up into an expanded book for each section. I had no intrest in the artwork of a photo illustration of a woman in the sky, but was interested in the body manipulation and the photo restoration. But each of those chapters were not detailed enough. You will run into many different situations and one photo or example is not enough.   More please - so I can select the titles that pertian to me. Its like putting fine cabinetry and house framing and boat building in the same book because you want to appeal to those with a saw as a tool instead of Photoshop as a tool. Photoshop is used in many different facits and never to the breadth by one that this book would like one to believe.  Limited appeal until its broken out into a series and added with more depth 
 Superficial, not enough to really get you started on actually repairing Leica Cameras. Covers way too many models from all the screw mounts, M and even R models with 1-2 pages at the most for each one. The book essentially  gives you an idea of what it takes to repair cameras but is not a step by  step illustrated guide for actually repairing them. This is what I expected  and was disappointed 
 This woman is no biblical scholar. She does not need to worry. I am sure she will never be mistaken for a Proverbs 31 woman.  Egalitarians make a case that the man is not over the woman in the home--that was a result of the fall. Yet, we wear clothing as a result of the fall; yes, we are under the New Covenant through Jesus, but we still wear clothing. We sin as a result of the fall; under the New Covenant we still sin. Women have pain in childbirth as a result of the fall; women still have pain in childbirth, today, under the New Covenant. Yes, the man is the head over the woman in the home as a result of the fall, and he is STILL the ordained covering, leader, and head over the woman and the home under the New Covenant.  One thing these women such as this author conveniently dismiss is that women will want to rule over men as a result of the fall.  At least this book was worth reading for me (and worthy of one star), because it reinforced my traditional beliefs and made me want to have nothing to do with the egotistical spirit at work in the feminist movement of pride, and power and control. 
 I tried to like it. I really did but I wish I never wasted my time with this. Fly by Night is way too long and way too boooooring 
 The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about 
 So I take this to mean that we've reached the point of moral decay that it's perfectly normal for daddy to be a convict in prison? I bought the book, hoping praying that there was a punch line.  The punch line is this book is being serious.  
 this scale is too small, I have size 11 feet and my feet dont fit on the scal 
 I was excited when I found this book, i have always loved the fairy tale series.  I only found 2 stories in the whole collection that interested me.  The others seemed to be written by amateurs, had poor stories and the story by Tanith Lee didn't even make any sense 
 Speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life I can honestly say this book did nothing for me. I do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies. However, I don't think this book gets that message across! It sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does, failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive. Besides that, it's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive. Also, I beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again. Close to 60% of people in America are overweight, possibly more. This includes children. We are far bigger than we were 100 years ago and ingest far larger portions of food. Heart attacks are killing more and more people and it's victims are getting younger, sometimes even children and people under 30 years old. Sure, some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority. I do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but I don't think pushing overweight models would be any better. If you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself, you might like this book. If you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked, this will sound like a really whiny, excuse filled, negitive book. Yes, I work out to be healthy. Yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how I feel. No, I don't want to look like a supermodel. I loved my body fat and I love it now, that's why I lost the weight to begin with. I want to live as long as I can in this body and feel the best I can instead of feeling slow, tired and heavy like I used be. I feel much better, my chronic foot pain went away and I have lots more energy. I work out 5 days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too. This book does nothing to help people in the long run, it's just someone's angry rant about their warped perspective! Being obese isn't healthy and that's why people think it looks ugly, it's not because we are a brainwashed, shallow society! And no, being fat is not a fate worse than death, it IS death and kills millions of people every year!     
 After my 2nd month on line, which included 1 month "underground," I one day woke up with an epiphany. As I changed the bandages on my ribs, I realized how absolutely stupid I'd have to be to ever want to turn to the people who inflicted that much violence on me and call them "Brother." I knew my history inside and out, I was loyal to a fault, and I still, in the name of "Brotherhood" had to endure whatever my line "brothers" endured at the hands of some pathetic individuals who called themselves "men." Fortunately for me, I dropped and never looked back. Today I'm a lawyer, husband, and father of two; never once having to wonder what "The Mysteries of Omega" would've offered me. What it GAVE me was a permanent sinus condition due to a broken nose, a bruised larynx from a punch to the throat, and the aforementioned cracked ribs.  The emphasis on academia? What a delightfully humorous and boldfaced lie. I know for a fact that 11 of my 14 line "brothers" had their transcripts doctored by an employee in the registrar's office; who also happened to be the wife of the frat's president. I'm confident ... make that positive ... that a simple comparison of that line's transcripts that were submitted to the National Chapter to the transcripts at the college would prove it.  Rename all Black Greek books in a truthful manner: "Black on Black Crime: The Black Greek Experience 
 He is NOT a doctor. The only degree he has is from a unaccredited CORRESPONDENCE school!!! It was shut down by court order in 2001. He paid $72 for his "degree". He is now involved in Oasis Life Sciences, a MLM selling junk 
 I was put off by the hokey futurism in Halperin's "The Truth Machine", but it had enough storytelling muscle to make me give this one a try.  The first half of the book is really interesting, as we see the twists and turns in the life of Benjamin Smith, his philosophy, his family.  Really, Halperin had me in the palm of his hand here.  But like "Truth Machine", once we get to the future, it all unravels.  We get wild speculation, world government, and so on, etc., futuristic cliches up the wazoo.  In fact, the world of the Truth Machine is the same one here.  So it was like going through that pain *twice*.  Halperin could do better 
 This is really two books; the first is about military technology and the second is on policy in the war on Terrorism.  Alexander does a pretty good job of presenting an overview of technology (lethal and non-lethal) currently under development for each of the military services (chap 1-3). Alexander is heavily involved in non-lethal weapons development, but does a balanced job of reviewing all tech.    Although his book is about military tech, he repeatedly emphasizes that tech is not enough. Unfortunately the book fails with the last six chapters when he moves away from the tech and into policy.  Part 3 is the weakest (chap 10-12) where Alexander discusses ways to  cut support to terrorists which, at a macro-level, are not new (i.e. cut off their funding), and are even radical (i.e. legalize drugs).  He also goes into odd policy discussions on the press and assasination.     The real disappointment comes when you realize that after all his discussions and expertise on the use of tech, he doesn't tie up a way ahead or how to link the tech with non-technical factors. None of his recommendations or conclutions go into how, why, or where we need to go with tech and its integration into doctrine, tactics, and strategy.  His scenarios only present glimpses and no programs.  
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch. Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player) So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund. 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 I truly am a fan of horror, even Italian horror. Esspecially since i'm Italian. I loved Dario Argento's work like Suspiria, Phenomena, Bird with the christal plumage. But come on deep red his masterpiece???!!!!  We should all have guts to admit it, this movie is soooo DULL!! It drags on and on and on. And then the killer, it's hilarous!  I even thought Phantom of the opera was beter than deep red, i really don't understand all the hype.  If you want to see Dario's masterpiece check out Suspiria, tenebrea or bird with the crystal plumage! 
 As I am reading this book, I'm going "huh?" and "what does that mean?" and "this is like poetry, apparently..."  I can't say I liked the writing style (such as it is), but it did create word pictures and pulses inside me despite my desire not to like the book!  It is a mood piece, at least to me.  Not a writer I would buy again though.  Sorry 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 I, too, received the lower capacity 49A instead of the promised 49X. Four times! Three by Amazon and once by Target. No amount of explanation by me could persuade them to check that large "49A" on the package (see my image, above) before boxing it and mailing it to me. On the fifth attempt, by phone, Amazon simply refused to try again. Yet, as of today, the product is still offered for sale at the attractive $71.99 price 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 I once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it.  Hey, I was young and naive.  I recently rented this movie to see it again.  I was once again robbed of my money. Cameron's Closet is 90 minutes of pure boredom.  The acting is horrible, the monster is laughable, the writing is unbelieveable, I could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers.  He then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him.  Then people begin to die.  A detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate. I can't begin to comprend why I liked this movie the first time I saw it.  This is just one big laughfest from the start to the end 
 This is great movie. No doubt about it, but quality of DVD is horrible. Picture sometimes got blurred, sound is very low quality. This is worst DVD ever. Movie is more then worth to watch, but not from that DVD 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 I was hoping for a book that would help me put together menus with the best nutrition information.  this one just didn't do that for me.  instead it had the same old tired and conflicting information as the other books or magazines.  plus, this one spent way too much time on the digestive process.  most of us already know that or just don't care 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 I didn't like this movie at all. It was pretty boring, especially at the beginning 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 This book makes me absolutely sick. I remember reading it in Jr. High as I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia and remember getting so many ideas from it. It basically tells you how to become the best damn anorexic/bulimic you can be. It's overly verbose with awful anologies- and not truthful- the woman was sick when she wrote it. I would never recommend this book to anyone- eating disorder or no 
 Does the Methodist Church canonize saints?  If so, they'll have to make way for St. Laura, arguably the most perfect person who ever ever lived.  That was my numb response after reading and annotating this turgid, 240-page confection by Ron Kessler.  "Our parents would say, 'We want you to be like Laura Welch [Bush]," said [classmate] Pamela Nelson... They would say, 'We want you to be friends with Laura Welch.  We want you to run around with Laura Welch.'  It was because she was like a perfect girl to her mother and dad... everyone thought she was perfect."  That's just part of the unending stream of laudatory Stepford quotes delivered in this "intimate portrait."  Fully authorized by the Bushes, Kessler quotes the choicest morsels from folks who subsequently get appointed, say, ambassador to Switzerland, and begins paragraphs like this: "Steeped in Midland values, [George W.] Bush sees himself as a humble servant of God."    This book is "ladylike" in the very worst sense of the word.  Laura Bush is vaguely present while a host of authorized sources, as well as Kessler, b*tch-slap Hillary Clinton ("I can't believe her book is selling so well," murmurs Laura), the White House staffers who unpardonably wore out the carpets during the eight years of the previous Administration, Teresa Heinz Kerry, Senator Edward Kennedy, the so-called "liberal" media who are "picking on" (Laura's words) that law-breaking Bush twins, and many, many more.  Most controversies of the lives of George W. and Laura Bush, as well as most of W.'s stint in the White House, are skipped right over, apart from praising Laura's "quiet dignity."  That's why the book's so short.  This dainty text contains no Diebold, no Enron, no Halliburton, no Plame, neither a DeLay nor an Abramoff, and a solitary reference to Laura's furtive chain-smoking.  Through Kessler's skillful omissions and summarizing, W's businesses don't go splat on the page, nobody was evicted to make room for the Texas Rangers' stadium, and there's nary a mention of the Texas Air National Guard.  Bush 43 glides noiselessly from Yale to Harvard Business School, as seven years disappear, just like magic.  Little new material is provided in this book that isn't available in the hagiographies that the author thoughtfully provides in his bibliography.  However, if you care, Laura's contact lenses are not tinted, and she's had no truck with Botox.  She hates to cook and loves to scrub things down with Windex and 409.  Her husband's grubby bachelor habits are detailed down to the last bundle of fetid old clothes.  (I did, however, enjoy learning that the stress of the aborted vote recount in 2000 caused W. to develop a festering boil, which he showed off to his dinner guests.)  Kessler sinks his fangs deeply into Ann Gerhart's astute book, "The Perfect Wife," which is about as close to a fair-and-balanced biography of Laura Bush as we're likely to find in the mainstream media.  When writing about Laura Bush, Kessler's style is so twee that I wondered how he managed to type this book with both pinkies raised.  He seems to be very easily impressed.  "On top of her duties as First Lady," he gushes, "Laura has somehow found time to read at least a book a week."  Really?  A whole book?  Just like thousands of Amazon customers do?  He goes on to quote a writer from Business Week who cooes, "The first lady is undoubtedly the most literate person in... Bush's inner circle.  Jackie Kennedy seems like a dilettante in comparison."  Poor, cultured Jackie.  And poor us, if Laura really is the most literary person in Bush's inner circle, and has as little input into policy as Kessler says she does.  Kessler reassures the dwindling GOP faithful that though Laura remains pro-choice, otherwise "she never really had any political opinions."   Laura also dotes on "literature on the bubonic plague and other epidemics.  'I love plague books,' Laura said."  Uh-oh.  What ostensibly was the biggest shock of Laura's youth--when she ran a stop sign and killed a high-school classmate ("with... big ears," Kessler adds eugenically)--is padded fore and aft with explanations of how dangerously Detroit used to build cars.  Please.  I'm a decade younger than the Bushes, and we had seat belts in 1963.  The only sign of genuine emotion described in this whole "intimate portrait" comes not on 9/11, not on her wedding day, not when Laura's daughters were born, but when a former high-school sweetheart appears unexpectedly at a photo op.  "Her eyes were huge, and she had this look on her face as if she had just seen a ghost.  She was in shock," stated her press secretary.  Well, if I'd married George W. Bush, I'd hanker after my old boyfriends, too.   There are a number of errors in the bound galleys I read of this book, which I hope will be corrected.  In a marvelously Freudian slip, Kessler notes, "on March 19, 2001, the invasion of Iraq was imminent."  A more insensitive example of author error is how Leilani Akwai, a Yale classmate of W.'s, is referred to numerous times as "he" or "him" AFTER the former Peter Akwai completed transgender surgery.  The most egregious howler of this biography is trotted out in three-plus pages of pandering to Jewish voters, when Kessler insists that in 2001, Bush held the first Chanukah candle-lighting in the history of the White House.  Not so.  During the first year of the Clinton Administration, White House staffers, their children, and kids from a local Jewish after-school program joined Bill Clinton to celebrate Chanukah.  The tradition has continued to this day.  Conservative writer David Horowitz also has circulated the meme that W. was the first to light a chanukiah in the White House, but both he and Kessler are wrong.  Well, hey, maybe Laura Bush is as perfect as her slavish biographer says she is.  More likely, as Gertrude Stein wrote of her hometown, Oakland, California, "There is no there there."  As a reclusive, bookworm, wife and mother, I used to feel a tiny bit sorry for Laura Bush.    No more 
 Well, it's a tribute to capitalism I suppose that here we have the 8th, and not final, CD in a series that only about 3% of those who hear it don't hate.  So, who exactly is the market for this stuff?  Is is all just parents who think they are buying one thing and end up getting something else?  With each new CD there is a new crop of moms with three-year-olds just discovering music, and somehow these moms get suckered into buying this?  Why do the used copies of this cost more than a buck?  Anyway, my wife borrowed this at the library and I woke up this morning to this cra...uh...stuff playing on my three-year-old's CD player (usually reserved for Beach Boys and Barney tunes).  It sounded different from what he usually listens to so I listened to a few songs while I was waking up over my morning coffee.  Talk about creepy!  All these angst driven songs about stuff my little guy has no concept of and hopefully some stuff he never will.  What parent would buy this CD for a child knowing what's on it?   Anyway, I reserve my right as a parent to let my child have a childhood.  He can wait until his teenage years to be a rebel and listen to music I hate, and even then I'll draw a line somewhere.  I just didn't want to deal with this stuff during the present decade.   
 I was very surprised that a lot of peole thought that this book was bad.I thought that the book was gripping but I guess that is just my oppinion. Even though the book had absolutley nothing to do with basketball I still thought it was a pretty good book. But not as good as 5 star 
 This load of tripe reflects 20th century Socialist Marxist doctrine  with such banal comments as "...suburbs have an elitist origin, which exclude the poor..." and "...expensive roads, cars, and the consumption of enormous quantities of gasoline have made possible America's sprawling settlement..."  Clearly, the author fears the present and a future that exposes meddling, bureaucratic central-planning planners as emblematic failures of Progressive Era naive idealism.  Seemingly, the author worships cities, the cesspools of humanity. His work is mere propaganda against what he hates most, persons living closer within Freedom and farther away from Officialdom 
 The author does a decent job explaining ISO requirements.  Contrary to the other reviewer's claims, there are "no" examples in the book.  Another useful tool would have been examples of ISO systems / process flowchart.  Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all.  I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.  Based on the title of the book "ISO 9001 Requirements", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are.  However, if you want to do ISO in order to improve the quality system of your company, as opposed to just getting a piece of paper saying that your company is ISO certified, then look for another book 
 Unless you are really into modern art, Picasso, and Guernica (the painting) you'll probably find this book a bit boring.  Not that it isn't well written and researched, it is, but for the average reader something more was needed.  I was looking for more insights into Picasso the man and a deeper look into those troubled times. About the only feeling in this book is a kind of leftist-elitist-snobbery. I'm about halfway through the book now and may finish it... 
 Unfortunately I was EXTREMELY unhappy after listening to the album. Unlike many other Altan fans, I view Maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career. The problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their  instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place. And the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like "well I guess we have to put a few instrumentals on" kind of effort. I'm sorry, but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs. She is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and  inspired arrangements made them for me the top Irish folk group. Alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels, jigs, etc. I miss Frankie Kennedy's flute too. Goodbye Altan, your best day's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 I hated this book.  It is vague and broad and won't tell you much you need to know.  The cute jokey style is a weak attempt to demystify when some insightful writing would serve much better.  
 The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence. 
 I ordered this book along with the Hollywood 24-Hour Miracle diet.  The book was packed in the same box with the 3 bottles of the liquid diet.  One of the 3 bottles of the Hollywood Diet broke open and leaked all over the box and ruined the book.  I returned the book with the one open bottle of the diet and the 2 unopened bottles of the diet.  In the future your employees should pack liquid items securely and separately from other items so they do not move all over the box and break open ruining the other items that are shipped with the liquid items.  I received full credit for my return of this book.  However, I originally requested another copy of the book but unfortunately it was out of stock.  I ordered the book from another company.  
 I really like Splenda, but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over-chemicaled taste and just doesn't have much nuttiness to it.  Perhaps the other flavors are better 
 This book is a crock. It's about a guy having a mid life crisis and doing what all of us do after we have somewhat "made it," gets tired of the grind, and begins to wonder if its really all worth it. The authors cite how many people turn to fads looking for answers when the authors  are really just plying another self help book in an attempt to create a new fad with their footprints on it 
 I must say the positive reviews here fooled me. I expected much more fun. I would have loved a real blend of soap opera and (even cheap) fantastique. But this doesn't even make the grade as 'so bad it's good' fun, at least for me. Well, maybe the first episode, but the second is just very boring. Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies.  The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess. I guess they didn't have much time to shoot this but overall it's just not worth your time.   
 Some books can trick you into thinking that there is going to be something to say when there really isn't. Sadly, this book falls into that category. Bound between the covers are 400-plus pages of common sense, rants about Windows, praises for OS/2, and constantly repeated philosophies that are never truly demonstrated.  There is an interesting section on memory and the way people learn, which are important considerations for designing UIs, so it's not a complete loss, but when the book actually got down to putting something together, it doesn't really have much you can look to for guidance. The iceberg analogies and the perspective models weren't very helpful either.  At the start of every chapter, the author cites numerous quotes from people no one has ever heard of and doesn't give any context as to why we should listen to them.  The most ironic aspect, however, is that the book, at times, is poorly structured. The sections don't seem to have any logical ordering to them making whole portions sound like a rambling of loosely connected topics, and of the text will cite a table or figure and then display it in a completely different section or even two pages down the line from where it was cited, making the examples seemingly irrelevant to the text.  All-in-all, this is one you can easily avoid 
 Although Mr. Sendak's books are wonderful, This collection, the Nutshell Library is totally impractical. The books are so small that they are disappointing. I bought the books for my 2 year old grandson and they are of no use because of the size. It would be helpful, if in describing the collection, the size of the books were mentioned. 
 An awful lot of people are making an awful lot of money dishing out what amounts to either common sense or drivel. Here the author requires almost 300 pages to state what could have been said in 5 to 10.  If this is an example of what passes for substantive executive training than heaven help us.  Borrow the book from a library if you must, skim a couple of the pages and you'll have all of it.  Don't waste your money 
 This is so boring I don't know how I read through it. This is the reason why people don't like history. It is really boring, and it's extraordinarily complicated, when it could have been simpler. 
 I bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as I would like! It is so hard to find a good heating pad now, but I would NOT reccomend this one 
 Bad news all the way around. Card does not work, could not get response from seller 
 As a James Michener fan I thought this would be his usual excellent book. It may be good for others, but it wasn't for me. Well duh, it is NON-Fiction. I'm sorry but it didn't have the usual Michener way of grabbing you. This is probably a great book for a studious reader, someone interest in the details of Spain (Iberia). Unless that's you maybe you should skip this one 
 This is a wonderful movie - with much more artistic content than the earlier shorter Christmas story video.  It is great except that for half the movie people are calling Charlie Brown names.  Blockhead, worthless, etc etc.  We had to stop the movie while our four year old was half through.  I should have prescreened it.  I don't trust peanuts videos now - for my impressionable four year old.  Maybe when she is older.. 
 I had ordered this CD for my husband.He likes the movie "The Longest Yard" and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie. Unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the CD, but I thought if it was from The Longest Yard movie, then it would be the soundtrack.Well, I received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open, he started playing it and was very disappointed.He ended up getting a CD full of stupid rap songs. I am not happy with what I received, if I could send it back and get something else I would,but I know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.My suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original,it does not mean it's what you're really looking for. I only spent $12.00 which is a good thing, but it could have lost a lot more. Thank you 
 Based on other customer reviews of this book I was expecting quite a bit more.  The humour is unintelligent and repetitive.  There are a small number of jokes that are over-extended in order to fill a book.  There is probably only enough original, unrepeated material to fill one chapter 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 The book tries to address Enterprise Risk Assessement. It tries to be all things to all people. The material found in it can be found over the web. It has very little in terms of relevant information. Save your money and opt for a practical solution instead 
 An interesting discussion of differing approaches by the medical and non-medical communities. The techniques espoused by Mr. Sarno didn't help my back pain, though 
 One of the worst!  The braces that secure the material and the tent together broke!  After taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods.  When I went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped.  It sits on our from curb for garbage as I write this review 
 This text is excellent in the coverage of its subject matter, but, like typical texts and journal articles written by a myriad of authors, it lacks coherence. Thus, separating the wheat from the chaff is tedious. The book, if well written, could be much shorter and more readable than it currently is 
 It was painful to watch this one. The day that stunt doubles start doing your trademark fighting scenes, it's time to hang it up. I love his early movies. Seagal looked bloated and uncomfortable. Everything, including the opening credits, looked cheap, rushed and disjointed. The transition between scenes was rough and choppy. The only star in this one was the computer geek whose brief appearance was actually funny. Can't recommend it, sorry 
 This book argues that just because the European conquerors did "bad" things, that doesn't mean they weren't good Christians. The author never gets specific about the atrocities committed by the conquering Christians (enslavement, rape, torture, murder); he only vaguely, infrequently, and euphemistically refers to them as "sins" and "errors," and he rationalizes that Columbus and other conquerors were simply normal for the time period in which they lived. Here is a short summary from the first section of the author's perspective on Columbus: 1) Columbus was not obsessed with gold; he just had a natural and healthy desire for wealth. Besides, Columbus needed capital to finance his voyages, so his need for gold can be compared to a modern academic needing a research grant. 2) Columbus didn't steal land from Native Americans because they didn't have any real (i.e. European) concept of ownership. 3) Columbus made slaves of free people, but that was okay because slavery was widespread in the world, and besides, Christians could enslave other people as long as they weren't Christians. 4) It is true that Columbus forced Christianity and western culture on Native Americans, but as a result, millions of people are in heaven. Need I say more 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 As you can tell by the title, I'm not enamored of this magazine. I've been playing video games since the early 80s, and have read many, many gaming magazines. My reasons for this negative review of Gamepro follow in no particular order: 1.) Their numerical rating system stinks. 1-5 points is just not accurate enough. Most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals. Not Gamepro. 2.) The written part of the reviews are way too short, and often are written borderline incoherantly. It's as if they hired the proverbial 1,000 monkeys to type them out. 3.) Often times they cram two or three reviews on one page. Screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp. 4.) The number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high. Once when I was bored, I counted all the ads in one issue. Out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads. 5.) Their article layouts are confusing, and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color. Forget about reading it if you're colorblind. 6.) Their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out, or plain don't work. I suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites. 7.) Gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags, such as EGM and Game Informer. So, in closing... if you want a good gaming magazine, just about any magazine other than Gamepro would be an improvement. Many great gaming magazines have come and gone, why a turd like Gamepro continues is a mystery to me 
 Yes, it's true that pharmaceutical prices are skyrocketing and that SSRIs are among the most frequently prescribed.  Yes, it's also true that SSRI's have been _associated with_ suicidal thoughts (causation has not been proved).  However, from personal experience with family, friends, and patients, I can also tell you that SSRIs have saved some lives.  One other reviewer points out that patients should be monitored very closely after starting a drug.  That's the real problem right there.  With declining reimbursements and increasing patient panels, primary care physicians are often not able to see patients within the first week or so.  That's the fault of the health care system, not the drug companies.  Frankly, we need a complete overhaul of the system, so that everyone can be assured of access to the standard of care that many of us enjoy 
 Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure. I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be. I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story. I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden! So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end. I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing 
 The Good:  The Mermaids Singing starts off well and feels like a good read.  The killers narrative works out fine and hooks you early.  Unfortunately as the book progresses it shows its age and in the end fails horribly.  The book is about a psychological profiler and perhaps that alone made it interesting in 1995.  Unfortunately nearly ten years later I needed more.   The Bad: I will put forth no spoilers here but I will say there is little build up to the ending and it is over in a blink of an eye. I felt like Val needed to have the book done by 400 pages and she wrapped it up just before she over shot the mark.   I love how she references Silence of the Lambs more than once and then liberally borrows plot points from it.   Bottom Line:  Read Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs both are way more fun.  
 Somebody put together curves and equations from other books to make quick money. You will be disapointed. don't buy it  
 Paper is appropriate in the title, the characters are utterly 2 dimensional as is the story.  Painfully dull with nothing to interest you in any further interaction with the characters.  I kept waiting for the good part and it never got there.  While parts of the book seemed to foreshadow greatness, it simply never developed.  The heroine is an utter turn off, by stages either seeming oblivious or dense.  The writing leaned toward poetic and could have set off a better story well 
 Christopher Catherwood, a professor affiliated with Cambridge University's Institute of Continuing Education, has written this book on the modern history of what has come to be called Iraq.  Putting Churchill's name into  the title makes the book so much easier to market to those Americans who react to Churchill's name with the same giddiness that any mention of the Beatles once elicited from teenage girls.  To his credit, Catherwood has tried to cut through the fog of ideology and propaganda to get to the bottom of what happened.  Unfortunately, his undertaking wasn't even close to successful.  For example, Catherwood claims that the oil companies had no way of being sure that Iraq had oil deposits at the time that the Iraqi boundaries were drawn.  This despite the fact that crude oil had been seeping up to the surface in Iraq since biblical times, when, because it was deemed a medicine, had been brought by caravan to such distant places as China.  Natural gas also made its way to the surface, and would catch fire in eerie flames that the Iraqis attributed to ghosts.  These indisputable facts utterly refute the world according to Catherwood that this book has to offer..  Catherwood implies that the British were only interested in Iraq's oil because of its military use - one almost hears undertones insisting that the British only wanted a platonic relationship - but neglects to mention the close ties between Shell Oil and the admiral who fanatically urged advocated that the Royal Navy transition to oil.  These ties were so close that some of his colleagues were convinced that he had some financial stake in the deal.  I could write further paragraphs in this vein.  Were I ever to write a book on a subject so shrouded in disagreement as Iraq's history, I would make sure to first talk with knowledgeable people from the region, and then consult the writings of academics.  Unfortunately Catherwood seems to only have done the latter, to his colossal book's detriment.  Clio must feel slighted.  The only reason I don't give the book a single star, is that there are even worse books on the subject 
 This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again.  
 If you have little or no experience in MLM, this book might as well be written in ancient Sanscrit.   First off, the editing seems like it was probably done by a laboratory chimp. The copy is riddled with syntactical, spelling and grammatical errors that would be unacceptable in a third grade English class.  Secondly, the content is generally inchoate drivel. The author fails to adequately explain most of the terms and theories before gratuitously tossing them about. It starts out with a graphic representation of a binary tree consisting of various levels of totally undefined numerals within little globes. It all leaves the reader slack jawed, trying to interpret it all for him/her self, without much or any real explanation, or a very cursory one at most.   The author also operates a garish web site which is mainly a tableau of bold font colorful hype promoting his products, to which the book seems largely dedicated to steering one towards.  Verdict: Next to useless for the neophyte.   
 In addition to the shortcomings pointed out in other reviews, I am disturbed by Mr. Cerami's use of 21st century values and perspectives to describe the motivations of 18th century people. For example, Mr Cerami describes Patrick Henry as a "religious zealot" for favoring the establishment of an official church in Virginia. Yet Henry's views were not particularly zealous for his time. Many in 18th century America favored established churches. Mr. Cerami also describes Patrick Henry as having become "ultraconservative" because he opposed the establishment of a strong federal government. In fact, Henry's views did not change over the years. He started out opposing a strong central government in England and ended up opposing a strong central government in Philadelphia or New York.  Mr.Cerami also describes New York Governor George Clinton's opposition to a strong federal government as solely based on Clinton's desire to maintain his position as governor of a major state. Yet Mr. Cerami immediately goes on to suggest that it was reasonable for Governor Clinton to believe that New York could prosper on its own without a federal government.  Mr. Cerami also makes inaccurate statements. For example, in discussing Article I, Section 7, clause 1, of the Constitution, which states that "all bills for raising revenue shall orginate in the House of Represenatives," Mr. Cerami mistakenly asserts that this provision requires appropriations bills to also originate in the House. He uses as an example the Louisiana Purchase, and states that the bill to provide $15 million to pay France "had to originate in the House of Representatives." An appropriation bill is not a bill "for raising revenue" and therefore does not have to originate in the House.  Further, in speaking of the Judicial Branch of the federal government, Mr. Cerami states that "[t]he almost supreme power of the judiciary branch" was one of the features of the Constitution that was most admired by foreign observers. However, there is nothing in Article III of the Constitution that even suggests that the judiciary is the "supreme" branch. Nor does the Constitution grant to the judiciary the power to determine the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Congress. Only later did the courts attain the powers they have now 
 My first reaction after listening to this disc was "Why?" The only justification I could imagine would be if Capitol refused to allow Brian permission to use the original recordings in the documentary (to which this serves as the "soundtrack"). What Brian has done here in re-recording some of his most beloved Beach Boys (and a few solo) tracks is akin to changing the formula for Coke. Why mess with perfection? Brian's voice on these recordings, while not entirely ruined, is certainly a far cry from what it used to be. It is actually painful to listen to him, 30 years on, trying to recreate the vocal magic of "Warmth of the Sun" and "Caroline, No". The studio backup singers are adequate but they may as well have been accompanying Michael Bolton. The most agregious misstep here is the version of "Til I Die" which completely misses the point of the "Surf's Up" original. Curiously, only one demo is included, "Still I Dream Of It", a song Brian allegedly intended to give to Frank Sinatra. I'm not sure why this song was included as there are probably shelves full of more deserving outtakes or demos lying around the vaults. I love Brian's music, especially his self-titled solo album, but this is really wasted energy 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!!

(and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 Because she is a real-life "Wife Of," Gigi Levangie Grazer has been hailed as the "on the inside" Hollywood chick-litter. Inexplicably, it turns out, because "The Starter Wife" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up.   Gracie is a "Wife Of" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface).   A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's "starter wife"?   Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of "The Starter Wife" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating.   Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal "Will." It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing.   Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person.   With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really BAD fluff 
 Although I am not a professional decorator, I do have a large collection of various cake decorating books to support my hobby.  This book was an entire waste of money unless you prefer to read directions instead of having pictures to demonstrate the techniques.  There is not enough new information to make the cost worth it.  The pictures and diagrams are so small and poorly labeled that you have to read lots of text to decipher her instructions.  Enjoyed her cookie book.  But would definitely not recommend this one 
 Dark Tranquillity's first album for Century Media is a disappointment.  Excessive keyboards cloud the mix, and Mikael Stanne's clean vocals are cringe-inducing.  The mood is mid-tempo quasi-goth, suggesting a second-rate Sisters of Mercy.  The songs run long, the hooks are few, and the band isn't tight.  Skip this album in favor of later, stronger efforts 
 This is a disappointment.  The book, though it meditates on a hot topic (black male sexuality), has no real niche.  It is too anecdotal and uninformed to be a history; too contrived to be a social analysis; and too shallow to be a pointed exploration of the self.  The writing has clarity and verve but no substance.  Near the close the author brags that, in sexual matters, he "developed an aversion to labels" (187).  Too bad.  This book needs a label, broader than "hung" and better defined than a tape measure.  The result?  Pop culture at its most boring 
 Even though I was excited to read this book and fascinated by the subject matter, I just couldn't slog through it.  Prioleau should have written either: 1) an academic study of the seductress as mythological figure and icon in history, or 2) a light, fun, flippant, sexy book for modern women about the art and history of seductresses. What she's doing instead is trying to merge the two, and it's awful. Her tone is saucy and sassy, but the sorts of comparisons she's making are more suited to an academic, professional voice. She writes as if she's trying to be the reader's bosom friend, but she can't help peppering her language with little French phrases (far, far too many little French phrases). She's not using footnotes, but she can't resist quoting from sources, so the reader has to page to the back of the book and find the reference in a list sorted by chapter and page number. I would rather have either easily-accessible footnotes, or else no quotations at all but an annotated source list for each topic at the end of the book. Overall, she comes off like an overweight, matronly, middle-aged history professor who's trying desperately to be "hip to the lingo" and the best friend of all her students when everyone would like her better if she'd just cut the cutesy act and be herself. Because of the style she's adopted, I don't have much confidence in her as a scholar, and I can't stand her as a writer.   Prioleau's writing is even more disappointing because the subject matter is really interesting! I *want* to read about seductresses. She covers famous and not-so-famous seductresses from history, women who really took the world by the balls and got what the wanted out of life, and I'm genuinely interested in reading their stories. But she insists on comparing each one to a mythological goddess, when there's no reason to do so! Each figure is fascinating in her own right, without the need to be likened to a Neolithic owl-headed goddess figurine. I agree that it's important to discuss the goddesses, that goddesses should get their own chapter, but the mythology and the primeval worship of female sexuality is done to death here. I would have much preferred to see each historical seductress appreciated for herself, for her own unique way of seducing and claiming power, than as an aspect of some ancient magical womanly life force. I understand what Prioleau is trying to do, but it's not working.  I made it halfway through the second chapter before I had to put this book down in annoyance. I would read it happily if it was an academic book or if it was fun, light nonfiction. But it's neither, and the mash-up means that I'm turning away from a topic I honestly want to read about because of the author's writing style. 
 If you're really a nice girl, then this book is not for you.  I found it distasteful.  Sexual Immorality will not enhance your sex life.  It may for the short term, but it always creates long-term problems.  I wish I had done a little more research before I bought it.  I would rather read a book that does not promote masturbation or say that sex outside of marriage is ok.  It's not.  If you are a nice girl looking for sex the way God intended, then I recommend the books "Intended for Pleasure" and "Sex Begins in the Kitchen."  These books will not only guide you on a path to increase your libido, but they will strengthen your marital relationship as well.  "The Nice Girls Guide to Sensational Sex" will only help you become naughty 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 Bottom line... 1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa. 2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.   3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish "GORE from BUSH".  Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right.  
 As usual, I was impressed with Dr. Sears' commentary on his Zone diet, but I was fairly disappointed with the recipes in this book. I was happy I bought it used because I never really open it. The only thing I actually use from the book is the list of mix-and-match snacks at the very end. The recipes are horribly complicated, time-consuming and call for ingredients you probably wouldn't normally have in your kitchen. I have yet to actually make a meal from this book because I simply do not have the time. I'm sure that if I did, it would taste wonderful, but because the title of the book "Meals in Minutes" is so far from the truth, I'm giving it a 2 out of 5. If you're thinking about purchasing this book, go with a used edition, and keep in mind that you won't be getting quick and easy meals ... but rather gourmet meals that will take about an hour to prepare and make 
 Dear God! I picked this up because I always like to check out female rockabilly singers, and admittedly, the cover is quite intriguing. But, yecch! I'm sure Josie's probably a really nice person, but her pathetic attempts to sound like Wanda Jackson end up sounding like, well, a duck. The songs are well-written, and the band is good, but Kreuzer's voice is just plain horrible--nasal, lacking feeling, and ducklike. Go buy some Wanda Jackson, Charline Arthur, Rosie Flores, or Marti Brom instead--get a real voice minus the eye candy 
 The special effects are quite good. The plot, pacing, acting, internal consistency, and internal logic, much less so.  Even fantasy must have some internal logic to maintain willing suspension of disbelief. It needs some tension, some drama, and some surprises. Dinotopia lacks much of this.  Most of the plot twists are foreshadowed well in advance. The major suprises mostly come from hopelessly illogical acts by the major characters. (An example, someone tries to kill a character, in Waterfall City. The victim survives and is rescued. Not only does it never seem that any charges are brought against the villain, he reappears later and is accepted warrily by our heros.) The plotting is obvious, when it is hoplessly muddled. There is foreshadowing about a major secret of the dinosaurs, a missing commandment on the obilisk of "rules". When revealed the secret is an anti-climax. The motives of the carivore villains are unexplored -- are they as intelligent as the herbavores? Why are they guarding the entrances to the underground ruins -- tradition? Even the "suprise" appearance of one character is too well foreshadowed to be a surprise. More of a "huh", thought so.  No explanation is given for the one bit of driving tension, why the mysterious sunstones are wearing out, and why anyone would expect those underground not to be failing at the same rate.  No explanation is even remotely tendered for how a 200 mile wide island of such diverse terrain could possibly be hidden in the Atlantic. (Given the wreckage and the islanders' knowledge of a war with Germany, the Atlantic makes more sense than the Pacific.) Even a nod towards time travel, dimentional portals, etc. would have been handy.  All in all -- the pretty pictures aren't worth 4 hours of your time 
 If you are looking for a book full of nice photos of other peoples bikes; then this is it.  If you are looking for infomation on how to restore your own bike; then forget it.  A totaly useless book unless you're one of those BMW dorks who want to babble on  about when the first mono shock was introduced.  A complete waste of money! 
 It's a gimmick.  Looks good on tv, doesn't do what it says. I'm embarassed to admit I even tried it 
 Small, thin, fragile, not worth the five dollars.  Find a better product from another company 
 This book is poorly written and hard to follow.  While the author manages to fill a few hundred pages, his writing is highly repetitive and his organization is largely incoherent 
 Dull and dragging.  I found a much more consise version of wiccan history in the beginning of most wiccan books.  The only good thing is the one naked person. 
 I am a Jew living in a college town in Mississippi for the past 5 years. I was born & raised in the North. I think Evans should rename his book "Fiddler on the Roof in the South". His book is a very nostalgic look back at Jewish history - as it was in the past here. It's very much: the southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil rights.  Evans should realize that times have REALLY CHANGED HERE! The evangelical Christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'I am praying for you!' 'Have you read the words of Jesus, who was a Jew like you?' 'When will you come to my Church'. Blah, blah, blah. Thank God for the minority of Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians and a few others who live here. They are the only ones to accept me for the way I am, and the way I will stay - a Jew.  I want all who are reading this to realize that I am only speaking for my experience. Jews who reside in cities in the South have told me that they have had far better experiences, and that they cannot relate to what I am saying. But I do want to ask Evans a few questions: 1) If things are so great for the Jews in the South: Why have you lived in New York for decades now??? 2) Why don't you at least write either a new Forward to the book, a magazine article, etc., contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of Jews in the South have changed over time (for some of us at least), primarily due to the rise of the evangelical Christians? I read Evans' books before I moved here, and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. For a Jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically Jew-less; and, at best, the majority of a certain denomination of Christians here ignore me. (By the way, I am planning to move to a city!) By the way, don't bother writing to me to tell me that I am "wrong", or to invite me to things like the Bible Study at your Church. Believe me, with all the praying for me that is going on in this town, and all the myriad attempts to convert me, if it hasn't happened by now, as they say in these parts, it just ain't gonna happen 
 If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one 
 Let's be honest: this is not a great Soulive CD. It isn't even a particularly good one. This is especially disappointing if, like me, you've grown to really like this band and know what they're capable of doing. With few exceptions the instrumentals are weak and uninspired. They simply weren't trying very hard on this one folks, and it shows. There's so little rhythmic variation among some of the tracks I wonder why they bothered to stop one tune and start the next, since the objective seems to be a kind of stupifying mid-tempo modal continuum.  The unmemorable vocals are too numerous and mostly sound like quickly-prepared filler material.  Overall there's simply precious little of the originality and fire for which Soulive is deservedly known. You have to wonder who let this one out the door. I'm just glad I downloaded it (legally) at emusic.com instead of paying ordinary retail. If after reading this you still want it, I strongly suggest you do the same.  
 I enjoy reading, but I am a very visual person and was disappointed in this book because while it offers suggestions that make sense, it takes longer to get through the book since it is practically all words and very  few pictures for inspiration 
 The product description in January 2007 is inaccurate: batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours, not 60; there is no hands free speakerphone; if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units). There is more: the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment; the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it; the clock resets itself when the power is turned off. I returned mine 
 You can find all the information (and more) this book provides on the internet. So if you have a little time to search the web, you don't need this book.  And it doesn't answer all the questions you may have. You still need the help of a lactation consultant or your baby's doctor. So if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement, this book won't help you 
 I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.    Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.    
 I don't get it, this story seems misogynistic. Oh no! Women in politics-Ahhhhh! Trust me-I don't think this is even remotely believable like the editorial descibed it as 
 Although at first glance this movie seems like a cute story, the general idea behind it disturbed me.  Why did this woman dress chimps up like people and try to get them behave like human children? Animals aren't  people, and they certainly don't want to be treated like they are--it's not  healthy for them or for their owners, as was illustrated by the problems  Gertrude Lintz had in keeping Buddy.  The film doesn't seem to get it's own  message 
 I'm just starting a class that requires this book.  I don't have a financial background.  The book is confusing.  It seems like the chapters outline basic principles.  However, when it comes to doing the homework problems, the text asks things that were poorly covered and/or obscure.  I wish I didn't have to take this class and could get my money back. 
 The architecture depicted in this book looks nothing like the example on the cover. It's more of a colonial feel , instead of the contemporary tropical that I hoped for 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life.  If you are expecting another classic like "Anchorman" watch another movie.  I was terribly dissapointed with Will Ferrell.  DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE 
 Last fling - I sure hope so. This book has a killer but Janeway spends endless pages mucking around at the track looking for the killer and it becomes endlessly boring. Oh, we throw in a paragraph here or there about a rare book or two to perk up bibliophiles but what a waste of time. IT will take infinite patience to stay with this until the end. The only reason I did so is that I did not have a backup book read to pick up. Save your money on this one, it is a total, and again super boring, waste of your time 
 It seems I'm the minority here, but I believe this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe it's only because I have no interest in politics what so ever, or that I was forced to read it for school. But in my opinion "Profiles in Courage" was so incredibly boring, it's not even funny. It wasn't well written or even very informative at all. It would mention political events, but not go in to any detail, so you must have a lot of prior knowledge to understand what's going on. Honestly, these senators seemed to be more stubborn than courageous. And I really don't care how dome shaped Daniel Webster's head was 
 "In My Country" is certainly a well meaning film.  Filled with dignity, it means to explore the atrocities committed in the age of Apartheid.  Can justice be served?  Can South Africa move on?  How complicit is the average man?  There are certainly important topics and issues to be dealt with--but rarely have I seen them served up so falsely and dispassionately.    Everything in "In My Country" is a construct.  You've got Juliette Binoche as the face of white shame, Samuel L. Jackson as black rage (though he's an American), Brendan Gleeson as the villain, Binoche's assistant as the tolerant and understanding African, and her boss as the face of white indifference.  Of course, this story is told from the vantage point of the white lady and the American--as these stories rarely examine issues from the African viewpoint.  Even the testimony of atrocities--which should be a dramatic highpoint--are so staged, so false with the requisite swoons from the audience at "shocking" revelations.  And Binoche is ever present to provide the tears--but as the emotion isn't genuinely developed, I continued to sit there feeling rather empty at the whole exercise.  The Africans are never portrayed as significant indivduals, but as understanding and forgiving souls.  I'd have appreciated a bit of emotional complexity at any point!  If the pairing of Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson seems an odd match, trust me--it is.  As characters with opposing views, they are put together rather conveniently.  No actual friendship is ever developed, we're just supposed to take it at face value that these two would hang out together.  Well, I didn't believe it for a second.  It was necessary for the plot, so it happened--why bother with actual character development?  There's a more important message to be delivered by having them debate.  Of course, to make matters worse--a romantic entanglement evolves.  There's not much drama there, either, as Binoche seemingly has an indifference to her husband and children.  If she's conflicted about anything, it certainly never shows.  And as if matters aren't bad enough, there's a heavy-handed (and obvious) ending that is supposed to be a revelatory twist.  But I can only say it once more, without bothering to make the characters real--who cares?    A message can only take you so far.  I'd have rather have watched a relevant speech, because no one here was concerned with drama.  
 After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought "finally, a book on communication between couples from a male perspective." I was expecting a sympathetic account of the communication between the sexes but such an account was missing in this book.  This book is s not meant for any man born after about 1960. The gender stereotypes are still very strong (both male and female).  The book starts with some helpful suggestions (don't criticise too often, set a time aside to share criticism) but then quickly deterriorates into a rant about how men have not been treated fairly in the media. Topics covered included abuse within the family (men are abused too) and male-bashing in greeting cards. One important missing topic from this list is the villification of men as pedofiles-- especially men who enjoy working with children.   Of course men can be abused by their wifes, and father's by their children but it does not mean that male on female violence is "okay". Rather than making the non-sensical argument that "we hurt too, so your hurt is fine," the author should condemn abuse in all it's forms. Similarly making fun of men just because they are men, is as okay as making fun of women just because they are women.   I have also wondered why there are very few programs for male perpetrators of violence. Most resources are for women, and the way to solve family abuse, is for the woman to leave. Where are the centres to help men communicate non-violently? Why can't the family try and heal together? In the first part of the book, the author identifies that female "fear" is often translated into male "aggression"-- good point, but why is this point not carried onto the discussion of abuse?  Then there is a list of traditional "unnoticed" male work, including being an unpaid bodyguard "in public places (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park", just as well a woman can be an "unpaid massager" for rubbing her husband's shoulders. Most of the other "male work" is incredibly gender specific and even a quick read makes it clear that these are special events (putting up the Christmas lights) rather than day-to-day toil. I found this list offensive. We both cook dinners, use the barbaque and put up the Christmas lights.  There is also the male role of "option generating"-- man asks where they should go for dinner, woman says "anywhere", man says "italian?" etc. Apparently "option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing." The beauty of being in a couple is that both parties can create options and both can reject. It's called communication and making choices together.  More than that, I find it offensive that the author glosses over all the important work men do in families. Men now do change diapers, take pride in being fathers, cook, clean and are partners also in the home. How has this development passed the author by? By enforcing the gender stereotype of "the man brings in the bacon", the author is also glossing over all the men, who might like to stay at home with their children... or who would like to work part-time to have more family time. As well as of course all the women, who might like to have a career.  Many of these choices should be made in the family. Gender stereotypes are truly just as damaging to men, especially because they limit the choices that can be considered "acceptable". Why can a man not enjoy spending time with his children? Why does he need to be able to support the family? Should the responsibility not be shared? Where are the men, who are single parents? Male kindergarten teachers? Heaven forbid.  One more irritating passage: "We often think that when a man insults another man by calling him a 'girl', the insult reflects a contempt for women. No. It reflects a contempt for any man who is unwilling to make himself strong enough to protect someone as precious as a woman." hmmm. yeah... hmmm. This is where I started to laugh out loud. Too ridiculous for words.  In short: this book is not for anyone, who is trying to be a father in this century. Rather than solving anything, this book just perpetuates detrimental and dangerous gender stereotypes. Perhaps the author lives in this kind of a world (and indeed much of the material seems to stem from his personal experiences), but I don't know any young man who would... Rather young men now are facing the same challenges of work-life balance as young women are.  It's time to get beyond male-hating and female-hating, juxtaposing male needs and female needs to find somekind of a inherent conflict, and to understand that men and women can live together. And that in a family, men and women have the same goal-- of making their families as happy as they can. 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 Memo to myself:  Never, ever purchase a CD from a band featured on Target's "emerging artists" rack.   Even if they vaguely resemble Devo, are produced by Ric Ocasek, or write songs with the words "riot," "razorblade," or "swinger" in the title.   You can practically smell the stench of a major television network or advertising agency as soon as you crack the shrinkwrap on this one.  I can see it now:  "Ladies and gentlemen, the Pink Spiders for Skechers!"   Can you imagine the divine moment of inspiration that resulted in "If you're alone and I'm alone/Let's be alone together."   Cue laugh track.. 
 I thought the book was a good book but wasn't appealing to me as it would be to some people. The plot is somewhat boring, there no "great" scenes and the conflict is just dragging on. There are no new occurrences, and when they happen to show up you know its going to happen. Every chapter repeats the same thing and when something new happens to change the plot it repeats for two more chapters. This book does have some up points though. The setting is very well placed with many historical and cultural facts popping up here and there. The theme is a good one and it's not to mushy, and it has a good ending; the characters are good, but a lot of them are your basic line up of people in a story. The drawings aren't very good and are just there to please the junior high students reading this with there teacher. This book is good for children to read and to learn about ancient Japan and that's why it was given out. I would not suggest reading this on your own time but if you're a teacher wanting your students to read and stand by the curriculum this is a perfectly good book. I give this book a C- for helpful information but an uninteresting reading experience.  
 I have been reading Sandra for a while now and while "where there's smoke" is not my absolute fav (envy is, and is a must read)it ranks up there in the top three. the twist and turns keep you glued till the final page and you are not going to want to put this one down. Sometimes a little rough in places( name calling and such).But all in all a very good book 
 Wow, there's so much; where should I begin? Well, for starters, let me say that the authors of this work are operating under three or four fundamental and critical errors of belief: 1) They assume that the bible version they are citing is the equivalent of the AV, or authorized text (it isn't); 2) They assume that "Catholic" is equivalent to Christian (it isn't); 3) They assume automatically that the account of history recorded in the Book of Genesis is not correct (we'll talk about that later); 4) They are very selective about which historical figures they choose to assume never existed (Jesus Christ, of whom much is written), and which ones they choose to assume did exist (Celsus, the linchpin to their list of pagan references, of whom little is written, and none of his written works even exist any longer). Yes, they are very arbitrary indeed about whom they will "grant life" to, these modern-day rehashers of old Gnosticism. And that is all this is, mind you: a rehashing of the same exact false religion that the New Testament writers fought against and warned about. What I did appreciate about this book was how it allowed me to better appreciate what guys like the apostles John and Paul were up against: I mean, man, this Gnosticism is slick, all right. I gotta give it that. What we're given throughout this work is the same old lie that the serpent told Eve in the Garden of Eden, that same old New Age lie that's being thrown around by the likes of Shirley MacLaine, et al: "You too can be a god!" Yes, of course. Look, let's talk about #1 of which I have mentioned above: In the English language, the only true Word of God bible version is the King James Version. All other bible versions are counterfeits. Sound crazy? Yeah, that's what I thought. Until I actually did the research. Try reading "New Age Bible Versions" by Gail Riplinger. She documents how ALL other modern versions of the bible are based on minority corrupt texts which were maladjusted to fit New Age agendas by a small and elite cabal of Victorian Age English theosophists. So anytime the authors of this book quote the bible, they are NOT quoting the true bible, which is why they are able to buttress their Gnostic agenda by it. It ain't Scripture they are quoting. It's theosophy packaged as Scripture. Okay, now for #2: These pagan authors assume that Catholicism is the equivalent of Christianity which, if these authors had just read actual CHRISTIAN sources, rather than their own preferred and skewed selection of pagan sources posing as Christian, then these authors would never have made such a mistake. Try reading "The Two Babylons" by Alexander Hislop. It was written over 90 years ago. It is widely regarded as one of the 10 most significant Christian books ever written. But do these authors cite it? No. Are these authors completely ignorant of it? Quite evidently so. For Hislop proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Roman Catholicism IS but a rehashing of the old Babylonian Mystery Religion. So everytime these authors think they are on to something significant, some amazing parallel between Christianity and paganism, nearly always they are merely talking about Roman Catholicism, not true Christianity. To write about a subject such as this, and yet to be so ignorant of such an author as Hislop, or so many other notable Christian works which would fly cogently in the face of their argument--indeed, destroy their arguments outright--is to evince an egregiously one-sided education. Okay, #3 now: If you assume that the Book of Genesis is fiction, then you can write whatever you want, as these authors clearly have. But if--just imagine if--this assumption too of these authors is wrong, and Genesis really is human history (as I could show you convincingly it is, given more space), then the minority of legitimate parallels which these authors present showing a connection between pagan mystery worship and true Christianity (discarding all the parallels merely to Roman Catholicism) is easily explained by what happened at the Fall of Mankind in the Garden of Eden: God gave a quite specific prophecy directly to the two antecedents of all mankind, as recorded in Genesis 3:15. And, what happened after that is easily explainable: those prophecies were talked about and remembered among peoples for many generations, although, like all oral traditions, they got warped over time: Instead of looking for and reverencing the Coming Savior, the Holy and Unique Product of a singular coming "Virgin Birth," pagan peoples began the worship of the "Virgin" herself--something we see in Roman Catholicism, and these other gnostic knock-offs, but which we do NOT find in True Christianity. This pagan Babylonian Mystery Religion achieved its seminal period under the ancient autocrat Nimrod and his licentious and cunning queen, Semiramis. And it is worth repeating: What we see in Roman Catholicism, and what we see in so many other tributary New Age-type religions, is but the lingering hazy hangover of that great and ancient pagan Babylonian religion. The bible, as well as Hislop, speaks much about this. This is all ignored by these authors, of course. True Christianity is something entirely different than what these authors present; it goes right over the heads of these polemic, tabloid-ish writer/researchers, because that's exactly how they want it to go. No amount of proof will redirect those who want to stay lost. Another old argument which would seem to devastate the thesis of this book--but which, again, these authors appear entirely ignorant of--was the one put forward so often by that master thinker of the 20th century, C.S. Lewis. He spoke much about certain similarities between the pagan mystery religions and Christianity, and he gave credit to these pagan cults for having appreciated a certain modicum of spiritual truth. For him (as well as myself), the fact that these pagan cults were on to the same thing only further validated True Christianity. For Lewis posed the question, far more than once in his writings: "Wherein do we see the FULFILLMENT of all these notions of a Savior coming to Earth and dying in order to save fallen man?" The answer to Lewis was obvious. It's obvious to me as well.  But then, I would never invalidate the life of the literal Christ (a peculiarly MODERN argument if there ever was one), while trusting in the existence of this shadowy, nebulous "Celsus" person. You want to talk about shaky ground? There's shaky ground for you. Boy are these guys desperate. It shows in the way they recklessly, selectively, illogically pick and choose who they are going to believe in as having really existed. In closing, may I add that the language of these authors is NOT the language of scholars, but the language of polemic tabloid journalists. Which concerns me, because in today's dumbed-down society, that's exactly where most people are at, mentally. Moreover, these authors are not above outright disingenuousness: When attempting to discredit the Jewish historian Josephus's reference to Christ as proof for Christ's literal existence, these authors imply that they have just discovered some incredible fact about how Josephus himself never referred to Jesus, it was but a later addition after the fact by some or other deceitful Christian scribe; the problem with this is just this: it is widely accepted already among true scholars that a few of these references in Josephus may very well have been faked; however, it is also widely accepted among these same scholars, virtually without exception, scholars on both sides of this issue (including the very scholar that these authors reference!) that most of the references to Jesus in the writings of Josephus appear to be genuinely Josephus. These authors fail to tell the reader that. They make out like they've stumbled onto something grand here. Yeah, right. Indeed, the driving method of scholarship evinced by these authors throughout this work appears to be nothing more than rampant speculation. Again: Tabloid, I say. God help these authors on Judgment Day for leading people astray. It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on That Day, than it will be for these guys, unless they repent of what they have done. I could go on and on. I took notes. Like how they tried to make a case that Paul was a gnostic. Holy smokes. That one was so easy to refute I won't even comment. Folks, read the works I have cited above. Better yet, read the New Testament, in the KING JAMES VERSION of the Bible. I read this book on a dare from a New Age friend of mine. A friend who is lost. I shall continue to pray for her.  Jesus lived. And He's coming back, maybe in your lifetime, maybe not. But either way, you've got an appointment with Him. He died for you; if only you will repent and ask Him into your life now, humbly, sincerely. Jesus Christ did the rest, painfully, and with a lot of singularly innocent Blood. I speak to the unsaved. The saved already know it 
 I agree with another writer who  was the only one who noticed that the A&E Production on DVD IS INDEED MISSING around HALF of the Mini Series that was shown on Sydney's Channel Nine a few years ago. I am glad we still have the old version on Video and if anyone has that version (ie THE COMPLETE Mini Series) with NO great missing Chunks, I would be keen to buy it. I liked Catherine Zeta Jones and most of the acting although I did notice some that was very obviously "pretend" fighting. If I can get a refund from "overman"  from whom I bought this DVD or from Amazon.com INCLUDING the horrible postage we have to pay to get things from USA to Australia OR EVEN A REPLACEMENT BEING THE FULL VERSION I would be happy to return the shortfalling A&E DVD 
 The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own 
 This is a very nice and soft blanket, the best out of all electric blanket.  However, I have to return 2x due to the malfunction controller.  After only 2 weeks of usage, one of the controller started blinking E and no heat at all.  Same problems twice! I can't recommend this item until the problem is fixed 
 this book is nowhere close to the exam.  if you're looking for practice exams similar to the california real estate sales/broker exams then look elsewhere.  
 I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.  Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.  The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me. 
 I wasn't terribly impressed by this work. There are good examples of a diary form novel, "Sloppy Firsts" and "Bridget Jones'", and then there is this....  It takes erotica and makes it boring. Amazing 
 Hayward has nothing new to offer--merely another prideful preachment to the already converted: those members of a privileged yet considerable contingent that has access to "absolute truth" and who are renewed in their faith by assurances that a long-ago, inconvenient wait at the gas pump, temporarily high interest rates (a boon for savers), and a comparatively minor incident (the Iranian hostage crisis)  were, first of all,  Carter's "fault" and, secondly, equivalent to the debacle of Iraq and the world's perception (96% of the population of our planet) that America does what it pleases, which in this case is to wage an indefensible war against Islam.  Note the book's title (supposedly that of a "scholarly" historian), which is nothing more than a fault-finding, two-bit harangue, picking up where Limbaugh, Coulter and company left off, for a change scapegoating an individual instead of "them" (the "liberal" media).  Next it begs the question (a specific logical fallacy) by characterizing and condemning Clinton and Kerry in its alleged "description" of them.  Finally, in the book itself the author spends page after page setting up a straw man (some figure whom he claims is worshipped by everybody in America) so he has something to shoot at.  This book is nothing more than a rallying cry for the neo-conservative base (true believers, guardians of "absolute" truth and morality, America-first as God intended) who have screwed up big-time and would rather not face up to it.  (Can't blame them.  It's a helluva mess they've created, so why not blame it all on the little peanut farmer?)  Absurd?  Worse. We have now created a world not safe for anyone's children or grandchildren.  It's time to end this kind of cheap sniping and look to solutions--or to Rwanda.  Perhaps by allowing American civilians to enlist as United Nations soldiers (as Canadians, Irish, and Australians do), we could gain some redemption in the eyes of the world, being seen as peacemakers rather than as self-serving, xenophobic (unless oil is involved), childish whiners.  It's time to make order rather than encourage further disorder.  A book that sanctions living in denial is the last thing we need 
 This author promises to provide the solution, but really doesn't present anything new. Likes to talk about how good he is. Does provide some helpful information about diet and exercise, but covered this in one chapter 
 Final Exit is not the type of book you never want to have to read. But it is not as dangerous as what some presciption drugs given by doctors every day are doing to people.   I truely believe that if medicine was different there would be a lot fewer people reaching out to kill themselves.  I am not saying anything bad about ALL doctors, but many people have died or had their lives ruined at the hands of an unethical dctor. There are natural remedies for everything from mental to physical illnesses.  Please thoroughly investigate all your options before you run to have surgery or go on pills because a doctor says you should. I urge people to do all they can to save themselves.  This book should only be a last resort 
 I've been waiting for this book to come out because I thought it would have information on a Chinese Wedding that I could share with my daughter. The books has very little information on Chinese Weddings other than why a bride wears red which is a lucky color and the traditional wedding outfit. I was hoping for more infomation like the tea ceremony and other things.  This book is basically about a young girl that fears that her Uncle will no longer have a special place in her heart and life for her once he gets married. And the artwork is not what I'd call the best. For me this was a long wait for just a OK book. This book could have had great potiental and done so much more 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 This isn't a textbook and a study guide! only some key word explain in the left hand side and the right hand side is blank! Don't buy this 'outline' if you only want buy a textbook 
 Frances is a sweet character, but this book is more likely to terrify than calm your child. We haven't had to deal with fear of mysterious shapes in the dark yet with our 3-year-old, so I'm certainly not going to introduce the concept, or suggest that cracks are scary because things with lots of legs might come out of them. The book also shows bedtime procrastination as normal and quite effective (would you give your child an extra piece of cake for getting out of bed?) And yes, spanking is bad. If you have an older child who already has all these fears, you have my sympathy and perhaps this book would be appropriate 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 The first few books in this series were so good - this one was dissappointing. I enjoyed the wholesome nature of the early books (and the last two), but this book was written entirely about the time when Ralph was lying to his family about his whereabouts and employment, hanging around with shady company and engaging in questionable activities. The author wrote about his own life, but some details about the lying and stealing could have been ommitted and made the book more consistent with the wholesome tone of the early books in the series. The book is interesting and more action-packed than most of the later books, but I would not recommend this one for family reading. The early emphasis on honesty and integrity are entirely lost in this book, with no apparant remorse over the loss. The series is often advertised as being perfect for families, but the later books are not materials I would endorse for young people. It's an entertaining book, but I don't feel I'm a better person for having read it. It does not come close to the standard set in the early books in the series 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 My girls love stickers. I was disappointed. There are not that many in the book, and it is very thin. Not the HUGE book I expected. My kids will be through this in an hour tops. I bought it for a plane ride. Looks like I will be ordering more 
 If you are looking for a serious study of Cold War history, than avoid Robert Dean's "Imperial Brotherhood." The idea that elitism and masculinity shaped U.S. foreign policy is absurd.  If the American populace did not approve of their leaders, than they would not have been voted them into office. JFK, and his entourage of ivy league advisors, no doubt were elitists and the U.S. expansion into Vietnam was a direct result of Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense, who was one of "the best and the brightest."  LBJ was hardly an elitist, since he graduated from Southwest Texas State College, and Richard Nixon hated the ivy leaguers and RN and Kissinger purposely kept the elitists out of the loop.  Once again, more useless history that is out of touch with reality and, just as George McGovern was out of touch with American voters in 1972, Dean's views hold little interest to any serious reader 
 Despite Ms.Kavina's obvious mastery of the theremin I found the bulk of the cd to be too contemporary, abstract, and just plain weird for my taste. Call it avant garde if you will.  None of the pieces left any memorable impression upon me and for much of the cd the music just sounds improvised and played more like musical gymnastics than melodic tunes. Not that that is a necessity in music by any means, but that style personally turns me off and to blunt just bores me. I wasn't even able to sit through the entire cd in one sitting.  I also find the tone of Kavina's theremin to be too pure and sterile, more like a synthesizer than the "classic" theremin tone,  a drastic contrast to the richness and warmth of Clara Rockmore's RCA instrument.  If you're looking for a cd to start your collecion of theremin music I whole heartedly recommend passing one this one and getting the Clara Rockmore, or even the Samuel Hoffman cds, first and perhaps return to this one should you desire a little more theremin variety 
 This book is quite simple.  It all boils down to this: The poor are poor because they are not intelligent.  The rich are rich because are they intelligent.  It is a pure right-wing, ultra conservative book that has been used as "scientific fact."    If one does a bit of research on Charles Murray and reads his other books like Lost Ground (a scalding critique of welfare) and Beyond Probation, it is easy to see that this is more conservative ideology disguised as "fact" or "science."  If you are extremely conservative and wish to read through a book that just confirms what you already believe, by all means, read this book.  However, if you are looking for a true contribution to social science and class relations, look elsewhere 
 All this book is, is a bunch of recycled articles from Fine Homebuilding.  The articles are random, not related and relatively hard to follow due to lack of photos.  It was a waste of money and didn't provide me much insight for my planned addition. FYI...this applies to all of the "for pro by pros" which are written "By the editors of Fine Homebuilding" 
 It is constructive to have an open analysis of any controversial topic. If there was no planned extinction of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, where are my father's sister, brother and mother.  My father saw them butchered when he was 11 years old.  His sister was younger than he.  He feigned death and managed to escape alive and eventually come to America.  I heard about his experiences first-hand.  Is it possible that these children and mother were threats to the Ottomans?  I think that the claim of the Armenians as a race being a threat to the Turks was a bit far-fetched.  How can that justify murdering mothers and their children 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 I feel bad there are so many Americans out of work. I also am optimistic that this is another phase of job retooling and functional change. Those who aren't ready to face that their career path has alerted will find this great company for their misery because they won't find a new job spending money on this book.   Think outside the box. Look at the obvious. Change and grow my friends. I want you all to find great new jobs in the global economy but this book will not move you any closer 
 Not enough basic recipes and not enough information.  I returned this title, it just didn't appeal to me.  If you want some more intricate recipes and some great basic convection oven info - try "The Best Convection Oven Cookbook".  Personally, I'd like to see some one write a book with roasting times, chocolate chip cookie recipes and more of the basics 
  Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same 
 I dont know how the people who wrote this book has kept from being sued. My husband was in the Vietanaum  war. The men that came home alive had every reason to speak against the war. Remember at that time government drafted so whether you believed in the war or not if you were drafted you went or went to prison. Its time Americans got their noses out of stuped shows like survivors and started learning something about their country and the coruption going on in our government. A poll was taken and published on t.v. and the newspaper and said sadly Americans were so uneducated about everything concerning even laws to vote on 70 percent of the people who voted didn,t have enough education to know how to vote on a issue even if they had a particular feeling about it. For the last year I have almost devoted 24/7 to finding out the truth about lies and deception in our government and the people who have run it, and it hasn.t been a pretty picture. From Kennedy on It seems like about 70 percent of people in power have been lets say not fit for command.I,m beggining to feel like Edgar Hoover I have pulled up so many unclassified documents, I can only imagine whats in the classified. All I,m asking is for people to care enough about America to take the time to educate yourself about this wonderful country so we can put people the people in charge to represent us that we can be proud of.  Had I been Kerry I would have sued the people who wrote this book. Is it my imaganition but it seems like everyone almost that Bush has associated himself with or nominated for office has been indicted for one thing or another, could Kerry have been worse?  I woudn,t trust anyone connected with Bush. Before I went to the polls in 2004 I had already pulled up 5 facts that were lied about Kerry in the campaign. Last year I pulled up Fraud in 15 states on the 2004 election claiming Kerry won, Last week I pulled up a 80 page document on the fraud in the Ohio election. Am going to end for now I could do pages and pages  I,m just a concerned Citizen that still believes in America and that we still do have some decent people like Kerry we only need to care enough about our country and do some decent researching before we throw just any body in charge of this wonderfull country 
 Metallica from the very beggining had huge potential but never lived up to it. They made some ok songs along the way but never had an entire album that was worth anything. This album is the only one of them all that I think is ok. It's the only one I can listen to and really the only one that is ok all the way through. Still not a huge fan of the album but its the best they did. Overrated but not to bad. Plenty of other bands that are way better 
 This is a decent collection of tales.  All the popular stories are included; however, there are some tales that didn't make much sense.  Readability is average.  I wouldn't recommend giving this book to a child to read.  As for a parent reading this book to his/her child, the overuse of colons, semi-colons, and commas can make for difficult story telling.  Overall, if you're looking for a good collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen either just to keep or to read to your child, you may want to pass on this book 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 Very promising, but a huge disappointment. I rarely give up on a book, but was unable to continue past page 26 due to the author's fixation on the child's bodily functions, which I found unseemly, unecessary and quite frankly, weird.  Seven, count 'em...seven references...one would have been quite sufficient, thank you 
 It's incredible how the author of this book is so biased; she is totally against P&G and her rage is obvious. One can easily deduct that she is using all her journal power to revenge of something. She quotes opinions of some employees who couldn't get a hold with their strong corporate culture and the few examples she gaves reflect the "truth" of 100,000+ employees worldwide. Where is the good side of the company? It is incredible how unfair this book is and how you can get the bad feeling of the author since the first page 
 I just bought this machine and was very excited. I unpacked it and was planning to sow a bed skirt. I never got the tension to work and the straight stitches were very uneven. After a while it stopped working at all since the thread kept getting tangled on the bottom. I received the E6 error message telling me that the thread was tangled. After struggling for a while and my husband trying to figure out what was wrong, I decided to put it back in the box and returned the machine the next morning. 
 This is a case of the movie being a LOT better than the book.  The reason is that the tone and the conversational style of the book are so "cutsey," so patronizing, so ... tiresome; it reminds me of one of the Dummies books.  The writers ask so many questions:  "So what exactly are emotions?  Heard of endorphins? Sound familiar?  When was the last time you had an orgasm from a higher level?"  I'm really into the subject matter and I'm 3/4 of the way through the book, but I don't think I can finish it, just because the bad writing (not the quantum physics) makes it so hard to read.  I wish the authors had just said what they had to say without studying the Dummies format beforehand.  If someone picks up a book about the relationship between spirituality and quantum physics, they have to have had some intelligence and some prior reading in both subjects.  These authors don't recognize that.  Fritjof Capra it's not 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 I enjoyed She Walks These Hills and was shocked to discover that this book  was written by the same author.  The plot was silly, the mystery was  uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional.  It read like a  draft for a course "Learning to Write Mystery Stories".  Ms.  McCrum should have kept this one in her botton drawer 
 Kane seems to think there is some irony in titling his book "Savages", but instead it adds to the racist overtones found in his faux anthropological approach to his "field work". The oversimplifications found in this book are upsetting to those of us who spend years working with native populations, and this book does little to halt harmful visions of native peoples.  This is an ecotourist approach to a complex culture and we are left with more questions than answers, and this book in many ways capitalizes on the plight of these people 
 I bought this book before going to amsterdam for the first time and was totally disappointed whenever I followed it's advice. In fact it is simply surprizing how bad the restaurant selection was. They should be called places to avoid. Amsterdam is full neat stuff. My advice find hotel online, buy a ticket and just go. Reading this travle guide is just wasting your time 
 Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time, by David Goodwillie is one of those books that at times fascinates the reader with insight, pace and plot.  At other times one wonders why the author and his editors included often tedious and disjointed chapters that far from enhance this memoir of New York.  As a native New Yorker, and one who lived there before and during the author's coming-of-age in the Big City novel, I usually am biased and get a kick out of these types of reads.  New York is like no other place - that is clearly true.  But one cannot help but sense that Goodwillie was reaching for a McInerney-type of novel, or perhaps even a shorter Tom Wolfe's style of New Journalism.  Sadly, Goodwillie, who at times in this book is clearly brilliant, falls short.  When writing in a more reflective and less journalistic manner is when the author is at his best.  And there was plenty of that.  Unfortunately, just when he grabbed my attention with his own style, his editor seemingly either allowed, or even encouraged, some unrelated drivel to waste several pages, if not chapters.  If he had cut out about 50 to 75 pages and focused more on the personal and societal implications of an individual trying to cut it in New York in the Age of the Internet (and its conflict with his desires as a writer) this book could have been very good.  It was not.  
 Not of the same caliber as the Blue Collar Gang.  Language much too rough for children to hear.  I enjoyed his part in the Blue Collar Gang presentations but, did not enjoy this one.  I do not reccommend this DV 
 This product had been given to me to help me relax.  I suffer from an anxiety disorder and the chiropractor said it is good for it.  DO NOT TAKE this if that is the case.  It made me sick as a dog.  I went to my doctor and he prescribed me medicine that is for people like me who has anxiety attacks.  I was then made aware that Herbel Remedies can make anxiety worse and not better.  Always check with a doctor before taking this 
 First, it took forever to get this book shipped and then when I did receive it - what a disappointment.  Most of the photos are poor, lots of "noise" in most enlargments - which is very surprising for "Life".  Second, there is very little written information.  
 I've read both Darwin's Radio and its successor, Darwin's Children. The real star of the show here is the evolutionary change itself. Bear's 2D characters drag both books down. Unfortunate, because this would make for a great SF read if the characters weren't so single-minded & cardboardlike. 
 I saw the book in the discount bin at the book store and I thought the title was cute.  I thought, well, the guy gotta eat so that's why he wrote a book so he could sell something to dopes and have enough money to eat...that should have been the whole title.  The book was awful.  The recipes were unappetizing, and the nutrition doubtful.  It would have been nice if the author, and I use that term loosely, just like the stools some of the recipes induced, if the author had given us the nutrition content of the paper it was written on...surely it is better for you than any advice they tried to put on you 
 I've read and often re-read most every PJ book and column ever written. I've always liked this guy. I keep his books after I've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store.  "On the Wealth of Nations" did not work. Honestly, it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one. It reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club. It's not so much PJ, it's the concept of taking possibly one of the country's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. It just doesn't land. What may compound it all is that PJ's writing doesn't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to. Age brings that on in all of us. PJ hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol' man part of his career yet. To take a book like the Wealth of Nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent. PJ gave it a go but honestly, I yawned a lot 
 i luv tony yayo cuz he is so rill wit his lirics and 50 cent is his frend and dey are rilly good rappers  yeah.......   
 I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read "Grapes of Wrath" or "East of Eden."  Instead I have focused on "Of Mice and Men" and his lesser known works, such as "To a God Unknown" and, my personal favorite, "Pastures of Heaven."  I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.  When I began reading "In Dubious Battle," it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work.  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell.  There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.  Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again.  After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue.  It simply never does.  Summary of "In Dubious Battle" - Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense...  ...and eating.  Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food.  There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.  Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  But I advise any reader of "In Dubious Battle" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  You won't miss anything.  Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.  I suppose now I'll give "Grapes of Wrath" a go.  Perhaps if it isn't one of his "greats," it isn't worth reading 
 I have no doubt the author is well intentioned and may in fact have had some good results with the exercises outlined.  HOWEVER, in my years of working with borderlines in clinical settings I think many of the exercises are unnecessary and potentially damaging.  Many of the people with BPD I have worked with have astonishingly traumatic abuse histories and to explore self-history without the tools necessary to contain the potentially explosive and RE-traumatizing emotions is foolish and even hurtful.  Furthermore, the author's assertion that the client be able to say that they want to use HIS text in therapy and the recommendation that if the therapist objects that the client move on to another therapist is TOTALLY misguided and naive.  I very much agree that it is important for clients to be able to guide their own work, but I am also highly aware of the ways people with BPD can split different providers.  There are just too many GENUINELY therapeutic reasons to approach the author's recommendations with caution to allow what he says to interrupt what may very well be extraordinary work between a therapist and client.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST PEOPLE LOOK ELSEWHERE, perhaps to the work of Linehan for more appropriate and helpful interventions.    If I could have, I would have given this book no stars 
 I am almost done with this book....but reading it has not been the experience I had thought it would be.  I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves.  It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her.  I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate.  Why doesn't Anne Lamott put down the pen and go work in a soup kitchen?  She definitely writes well and I enjoy her style, but she needs to get outside her head 
 To begin with this review does not deal with the whole of Sokal and Bricmont's work, only with the chapter on Deleuze.  In essence all the authors do in this section are quote long passages from Deleuze work (and his collaborations with Guattari)that deal with the philosophical issues surrounding scientific concepts (or functions in Deleuze terminology) and then make a pejorative comment without any substantiation.   For example "the end is totally devoid of meaning", "...the end of the passage is meaningless" , "it is devoid of both logic and sense."  Those parts of the quoted passages that the authors, as any careful reader, do not find "meaningless" are dismissed as "banal observations" or "sometimes banal" or dealing with issues in the philosophy of science that the authors believe were settled for ever 150 years ago and so we may imply should never be discussed again.  It is possible, I guess, that a rigorous scientific analysis of Deleuze philosophical writings may be able to point out some scientific error, but the authors offer nothing but unproven ejaculations that would seem to say that anything correct in their opinion is so obvious it is not worth saying and anything they have not been able to understand has no meaning at all.   Sokal made his name by perpetrating a hoax and that seems to be the pony's only trick, too bad 
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 When I met with my academic advisor to discuss the college guide books I had been reading, she warned me that College Prowler is considered a reputable source of information by neither her nor any of her colleagues in academe.  Sure enough, when I came to Amazon just now to sell my two used College Prowler books, I noticed that shortly after each book had been published, a single person had submitted a five-star review for both books. In one review, he stated he's "from the East Coast," and in the other review he stated he's "from the Pacific Northwest."  It looks like my academic advisor was correct about College Prowler 
 YO THIS JOINT IS WACK. ITS A WASTE OF TIME I DON'T WHY I BROUGHT IT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO WAIT FOR LIL WEEZEE TO DROP HIS NEXT ALBUM. HE IS CASH MONEY NOW. SINCE JUVE HAS LEFT MAYBE THE REST OF THE HOT BOYS SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO MICKEY AND LAC ARE JUST PLAIN WACK. MANNIE FRESH HAS BEEN SURPASSED BY THE LIKES OF TIMBERLAND, NEPTUNES,TRACK MASTERS HIS BEATS JUST CAN'T COMPETE ANYMORE. CASH MONEY SHOULD LOOK INTO LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO THEIR TRACKS INSTEAD OF MANNIE DOING THE WHOLE ALBUM BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS TOUCH 
 Poorly written.  Disorganized.  No new information.  Not worth the time it takes to read it... or the price 
 How can people like this piece of trash?What a stinker!I think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons.And all that endless talk about "the Institute" which looked like it was setup in someone's garage.I can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational.It motivated me to turn off the t.v. and go for a ride.I really believe this movie was produced by Satan 
 What person of color would listen to some kats named lil SAM and big BO? SAMBO? They are insulting themselves as well as any other person of color in the world. These guys rhymes suck so bad they make my ears want to retract into my head so they won't have to suffer anymore. To add insult to injury these clowns probably don't know what sambo means and chose the names cause they thought it was "cool". Do us all a favor and find the nearest/strongest southern oak tree and string yourselves up on it plantation style 
 I agree with the other reviewer.  The bible verses often do not seem to fit the story or they aren't appropriate for the age group.  Often, my daughter (age 8) would "get" the intent of the devotion, but would then be confused by the "scripture answer" in the back of the book.  I also find it tedious to keep flipping to the back for the answers.   However, it IS a great conversation starter 
 Imagine a ring around a star.  A ring shaped like a giant canal, with sides high enough to keep an earthlike atmosphere in, and a floor covered over with dirt and teeming with billions, even trillions of beings spread out over a surface area greater than all the planets in our solar system.  The very concept of Ringworld is so cool that it gives any book set there an extra star.  In spite of this, I give it only two stars, which should tell you how bad everything except the setting is.  First, there is the constant, and distracting, obsession with alien sex.  The concept of "rishathra"- sex between races- is mentioned at least once in every scene involving non-humans.  It is the focus of many conversations that do nothing to move the plot forward.  And when Niven describes it you get the distinct impression of a thirteen year old nerd trying very hard to be as blasï¿½ as James Bond.  ("Ho hum, the aliens are having sex, I've certainly seen this before, let's watch!")  Niven is thus entered onto the list of sci-fi writers who manage to make sex completely uninteresting.  Indeed, I'd say he's so bad at it that he might even dethrone Robert Heinlein from the top of that list.  Second, the plot itself is convoluted and makes very little sense.  The book jumps back and forth between a group of aliens who make a trek across the Ringworld and Louis Wu, a human trapped on the artificial construction who must battle to save it from a weird alien menace.  However, the aliens could easily have been eliminated from the book - as far as I could see there was no connection between them and the main Louis Wu storyline.  Not that the main storyline was anything to write home about.  The weird aliens were all battling each other for the privilege of saving the Ringworld, so I'm not exactly sure where the sense of menace was supposed to be coming from.  Add to that the haphazard introduction of a new character halfway through the book and the gimmicky deus ex machina resolution, and the plot entirely fails to deliver.  It should be noted that this is the third - or perhaps even fourth- book in the Ringworld series, so longstanding fans may not be as confused as the reader who is picking it up for the first time.  But whether you are a fresh reader or an old fan, my recommendation would be to stay away 
 The whole album sounds the same...no even close to the last album. It does have a good baseline throughout so if you like that sound, you might like the album 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 2 1/2 stars  For the most part many of these songs demonstrate the colder, more distant aspects of pop songwriting, however warm the "vibe" would have us believe, with their autopilot musicality and predictable tunes. On the few songs that do feel more inspired then the generic majority, it is definately possible to see future pop majesty this band is capable of achieving, albiet it in a watered down farmiliar way to anyone who has ever picked up an older Belle and Sebastian album, whose shadow will hopefully prove underwhelming on future releases.   
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 I had what is like an allergic reaction to this book. I have this fear that if I don't say something this might be mistaken for a great novel... there is no great poetry here; just fascination with death and death. My reaction was like litmus paper: this is a disgustingly self centered book about: 1) suicide 2) homosexuality 3) " painfully susceptible sensibilities" " Virgina Woolf put a stone into the pocket of her coat , walked into a river and drowned." Over and over and over... It makes you afraid of reading Virginia Woolf. Well, the book made me want to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf anyway 
 I have made 5 of the 18 puzzles out of this book, but have found 3 mistakes in the book. So you need to be smarter then the author of the book to figure out the mistakes. I enjoyed the book and like the puzzles. The book just needs to be updated and mistakes fixed 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  .. 
 THIS BOOK IS ALMOST ALL PHOTOS OF GOBLETS, VERY FEW PHOTOS OF ANYTHING ELSE,THE PHOTOS ARE POOR IN MANY EXAMPLES, THE PRICES SEEM VERY UNREAL. RUTH WEBB LEES HANDBOOK OF EARLY AMERICAN PRESSED GLASS PATTERNS IS MUCH  MORE INFORMATIVE AND HAS BETTER PHOTOS IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE  THIRTIES. THE BEST NEW BOOK IVE FOUND ON PATTERN GLASS IS  THE COLLECTORS  ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PATTERN GLASS. BY MOLLIE HELEN MCCAIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  YOU BUY MOLLIES BOOK, YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED WITH IT, AS I WAS WITH THIS  ONE 
 Elia Kazan performed miracles on stage and screen, but he had the talent behind him or in front of him, namely Brando,Vivian Leigh, James Dean, Julie Harris, Natalie Wood, M. Clift, Lee Remick etc. He butchered Tennesse William's Cat On A Hot Tin Roof's third act, but it worked on the stage, and opened the doors for more buthering in the Elizabeth Taylor film with Paul Newman, directed by Richard Brooks.   Kazan collaborated with Arthur Miller on many projects, and we learn they shared Marilyn Monroe in bed..stated as a matter of course or as a funny sort of arrangement, not to put too fine a point on that novel and film (The Arrangement..Kazan's autobiography, as tasteless as anything he might have arranged with Miller and the unsuspecting Marilyn Monroe.)  Kazan did much to push Hollywood out of the censorship habits of scripting and acting and directing; he brought T. Williams' Baby Doll to the screen, never knowing it came from Chaucer,  with the great Carroll Baker and brought down the wrath of the Roman Cath. Church, not a bad thing to do. He also challenged old screen acting attitudes by placing Raymond Massey and James Dean in long emotional scenes together in East Of Eden, showing Massey's terrible  histrionics and narrow ideas about screen acting , driving Massey crazy. James Dean gave both Massey and Kazan lessons. It is interesting that Massey's performance was never re-done, but lies there , a weird contrast to Dean's greater talents, and Julie Harris' as well. Those dead zones in Kazan's work becoime more freqent as he pushes on into the 50's and 60's.  With Brando Kazan brought out the best to be sure; A Streetcar Named Desire was made into a movie, with that awful ending that Kazan thought was "Ok" again that lack of artistic insight. Furthermore, Kazan never liked Vivien Leigh as Blanche or as anything, which showed a disturbing deficit in Kazan's sensibilites about Tennessee Williams. Kazan never "got" Streetcar" and it shows in the way he tends to make Leigh as Blanche look like a woman afflicted with the disease of poetry,  a loser out for lust, namely Brando, who is irresistible to her. This shows no understanding of the play's subtleties.  The Cat On A Hot Tin Roof stuff is bad, the way Kazan re wrote it, with Big Daddy not returning in Act 3, which ruins the play completely. Thenm there are the put downs of Williams and William Inge too,the latter,  who wrote screenplays for Kazan, one Splendor In The Grass, beautifully written and acted, with the ususal Kazan blind spots: overacting fathers and mothers, like Karl Malden did in any Kazan film, or Andy Griffith in A Face In The Crowd. Kazan films do have scenes that are sheer melodrama, very TV, weakening many of his films. (Parenthetically, in Splendor In The Grass, where we have poetry ,William Wordsworth informing all of it,starting with the title,of course, all the way through the film. But with Kazan's peotic perspective we have cuts and changes that explain the many allusions to Wordsworth'sIntimations Of Immortality, from where the title comes,  the Kazan way,the Cliff Notes way..simplistic and very damaging to the central characters' roles and their final encounters with each other.   Kazan with Blanche in Streetcar, and with Wordsworth in Splendor In the Grass and so on... He never understood the life of the poetic mind beacuse he hadn't the training or talent, and he was therefore unable to cope with a James Dean or a Marlon Brando when they moved away from his reductionist  approach to all art.  Wild River with Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick is very good, and  Kazan could not get the audience to see the film, because he thought of Wild River in terms of receipts, not as classic or unique. And  so he reverted to imitation in Splendor in The Grass, a Rebel W/out a Cause feel to it, having ignored the Wordsworth themes written into it by Inge.    Indeed, an extraordinary career with other films touching , only touching, touchy topics,  such as Pinky, Gentleman's Agreement, Viva Zapata, Sea Of Grass, America America, and that uneven version of The Last Tycoon, with De Niro and Moreau in charge,thank God. (Ironically, De Niro's name in the film and the Fotzgerald novel is Monroe Starr.)Kazan could never shake the refernces to Marilyn Monroe, and by extention Miller. And we come to the worst moment in his career, After The Fall. It ended his success with everyone, and Arthur Miller was through as a successful playwright.(In the 2000nds Miller would approve opf a revival of After The Fall..the same reception ensued..the public still remembers Marilyn Monroe with fondness, great love in fact..Miller, like Kazan, did not see this and a lot more.)After The Fall is about Marilyn Monroe and it is a mean-spirited play about her, thinly disguised as a bitch baby of no importance. Miller thought of Marilyn as only a compositional resource for years, a ticket to fame in films. Butlook at The Misfits, and how Marilyn dominates with Clark Gable the entire film, with the help of Huston's script changes..Marilyn and Gable died after this film and so did Miller's film dreamsw.)In any case, the public in 1964 stayed away in droves from After The Fall, and all of Broadway and Hollywood and the public at large never forgave either of them. Others before Kazan and Miller had trashed Marilyn after her death with the same results: finished in show business.  Tony Curtis learned harsh lessons, as did Tony Randall, and many others, for their remarks about Marilyn's so-called lateness on the sets, and her drinking and drug use. Kazan and Miller thought they were above the low life trashers; they were not and were shunned.  But the worst was On The Waterfront, NOT Brando's performance, but the defense of informing which is what the film is all about. Kazan would have sold out anyone to keep his place in America America in tact; he named people with out a blink of the eye to a group(McCarthy's brownshirts) that could have taken over after Stalin died, and did, in the USA. Even Miller, when called, refused to name names, but Kazan did and he was a bastard to do it. It shows the very large dark spot of commoness in his life and work, a something missing in Kazan's idea of the age, a fatal,  profoundly disappointing stupidity, based on his survival instincts, impulses which places On the Waterfront, the ultimate homage in the age of MCarthy to informers, as art clearly in the service of evil and banality.   He did indeed need stars to get it all going, and other directors need them too, after all, you want talent like James Dean on every film you direct. However, Kazan 's work has the commercial taint to it; always,  there is bad secondary casting; his films preach and talk forever about the need to stand for something; he condemns the immoral, but always esteems the patriotic informer, and for this sensibility  he lost Brando forever for doing this in On The Waterfront. But look at Malden as the priest in this film..endless self-posturing, and self-justification;  and again in Streetcar, acting out Mitch rather than feeling his way around Blanche with his hyprocrisy, as Williams' wrote it.Vivien Leigh fights her way through to the climax of the scene with the lantern covering the light, with Malden reciting lines all over the place, garrulous and meaningless. Again, no poetic sense on Kazan's part, or any clue as to the significance of the scene, that's why Kazan could  so easily compromise on the gay issue here and again, on that absurd ending to the film, Streetcar Named Desire. All this is defensible to be sure, on some rhetorical level,  but there is that spot of commonness, that facist streak of the squeeler that covers Kazan's films with didacticism,an insincere hectoring of the themes of his pictures on racism and anti-smitism, a smallness, a Lilliputian mind esentially,  that tried to usurp Tennessee Williams' plays, trashed V. Leigh's art, thought Brando never did another good film after On The Waterfront (Last Tango In Paris, to name a few), who toyed with Marilyn Monroe , a n icon forever..Kazan never knew she was or could be that, nor did Miller...they thought they were the icons of the age, esp. Kazan, and he was not..noone went to see his very personal America America or his autobiographical pic, The Arrangement. They are self-serving, malicious, and, without Williams around or Inge or Steinbeck, poorly written, as, in America America he wants us to see the greatness of HIS arrival in America. How America is now twice blessed in his arrival, hence perhaps the repetitious title. In The Arrangement..a lurid Deborah Kerr(How could anyone conceive Deborah Kerr as this sort of non person; a career killing perfomanbce by Kirk Douglas, and so on..and the editing..horrible jumps and lurches forward and backward, signifying nothing. Kazan needed great stars, but he needed a script too, and imagination. By this time, the late 60s, his imagination had cancelled itself out, with Kazan's blocked mind about conscience, informing, facism, and Monroe.    But we look to others for greatness in every sense of that word..Huston, Wyler, Lang, Hawkes,and abroad, Kurasowa, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman,  and a few others. Artists don't shoot other artists to get ahead, to shoot that next film. The low vibrations of such informing acts stick, and eventually produce After The Fall dramas, which make us question all that went before in Kazan's work.   Kazan said once that Gentleman's Agreement did not go far enough, there was a hestiancy in his(Kazan's) drive behind the film. Indeed, a hestiancy with anti-semitic issues, but not a hesitancy about naming in sheer ignorance of Stalin or anybody like him,  8 people who were ruined because of Kazan's stand against their freedom, and his liking of the ways of facism...an easy, evil political ideology that softens all of  his work, makes it luke warm, unspiritual,which it wants so despertely to be, and, except for Brando and all the stars of greatness,makes it a bit nauseating.   
 The film is great, but I was extremely disappointed because I didn't realize that it is the widescreen version - i.e., it doesn't cover the screen top and bottom. Beware! No wonder it was only $9.99...  
 you have to read it in Russian. You CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT, and i repeat, CANNOT (!) read it in translation- its like trading feces for gold. That is literally what it sounds like in comparison to the original. The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.   I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing. It beats Shakespeare. 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 A "Chosen" Shrink uses Stalinistic tactics to promote his world view.  Very typical stuff. A good book to read to understand why the Jews can't living in peace with anyone 
 Lonestar has accomplished one stratigic plan, have all songs sound like they belong on Lonely Grill.  Their newest album remains true to this belief. While it worked twice, it's getting a little tiresome not only for the ear, but even Richey sounds a bit bored as well.   Basically watered down pop, with no fizz. Try Lonely Grill instead 
 I had to buy this book for one of my upper divison Lit. Theory classes and the price I paid for it balanced against the number of texts out of it we had to read isn't worth it.  You can save yourself a lot of money and actually do yourself some good by just buying all the book in this anthology and keeping them for future reference.  Price, however, isn't my largest complaint with this book; the fact that it doesn't have ONE complete text and gives you only bits and pieces doesn't clue you in to other important aspects of these philosophers!  If you have to buy this book be forewarned that it's a waste of money and will be of no use to you to save for the future.  The only good thing about it is it at least gives you a PREVIEW of important works of continental philosoph 
 nothing really extraordinary here.  lots of slandering dark-skinned peoples with the word "savages" thereby excusing genocidal and land-grabbing actions by the more "civilized" Xtian believing "aryans" who of course have evolved beyond all that superstition by emblazoning their one true god on their only appropriate place of worship--dollar bills 
 This is the first book that I have ever felt the need to return.  I am sure this book was a huge help a few years ago, but unfortunately at this point it is largely outdated 
 This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original "ReAnimator" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks 
 This product's active ingredients are alpha lipoic acid and biotin--these are common ingredients in natural multivitamin formulas which would be a better value. I am type II diabetic and have found the following herb/vitamin formulas to be excellent: Nature's Way Blood Sugar formula ($7 per bottle) Geromatrix Glucose Balance ($28/bottle) Life Enhancement Insulife ($24/bottle) Wild Tibetan Goji Berries for repair of tissues damaged by high blood sugar 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.  My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.  The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.  The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer. 
 The play itself was good, but the quality of video and sound was very bad all through the DVD. The sound quality near the end of play was too bad with irregular flattering in sound and video or intermittend drop out of sound. 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 Being in the fire service for nearly 10 years and an instructor, this book does well for individuals with a decent level of fire knowledge.  However, for the fundamental student or beginner fire fighter, this book lacks serious explinations of the basic concepts.  This book has done nothing but confuse students with it's constant bombardment of calculations without providing clear explinations. Outside sources are constantly used to supliment what this book lacks. If it's used for a begining Fire Engineering or as a suppliment book for Fire Behavior, I would recommend it.  But the lack of the fundamentals that it mystically tries to build on, is extremely frustrating and lacks any sort of foundation. Advanced levels - I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 Beginner levels - I'd give it a 1 out of  
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 These young girls might be able to sing but they have ripped off songs from other very good arists who can actually bring meaning to songs.  We dont need another wannabe pop groups.  These girls just need to go back to high school 
 I enjoyed this book because I have many common thinga with Pocahontas.For exaple she has an older brother and so do I. I garantee you'll love this book as much as I did  
 Suddenly, everyone is condemning America. Rock 'n Rollers, writers, artists, actors and actresses, foreign dignitaries. They're all pointing their finely manicured fingers at us "vulgar" Americans warning us about our "decadent" lifestyles and "hegemony." We're too fat, too materialistic, too self-centered, too violent, too pushy, they decry. And this, they insist, is why the world hates us. But first it warrants asking: are all theses stereotypes true? Are we Americans really that horrible? Where are the facts to prove it?  Leftist author Mark Hertsgaard in his book "The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World" doesn't attempt to answer these questions. Instead, his aim is to perpetuate the anti-American stereotype, to exonerate and explain away those who hate us. One of the most mind-boggling parts of Hertsgaard's book is when he attempts to extol African culture over American culture (which part of that vast continent he extols he does not make clear). The Africans, he insists, lead a far more relaxed, casual lifestyle than our own frenzied one. Americans are too greedy and pushy and violent. If only we could be more like the Africans, the world would love us, and peace would reign over the land.  Statistics show, however, that Americans are rather laid-back, moreso than even those precious Europeans. The Swiss, for example, are more concerned with time than the average American. And as far as being violent, once again statistics show that Americans are less violent than even the saintly Canadians. But the Left never allows for facts and figures to interfere with its arguments. So instead, Hertsgaard praises Africa's primitive ways, which, to him, are more idyllic. Once again ignoring data, he fails to acknowledge Africa's AIDS crisis, genocide, female mutilation, mass starvation, tyranny, ethnic warfare and average lifespan of about 46 years.     Leftists like Hertsgaard who bash America on all levels while praising the most war-torn, impoverished societies on earth make clear their intentions. The world, Hertsgaard argues, should not rest until America is brought down to its level. In Hertsgaard's religion of socialism, America is the devil, and anyone who hates the devil is level-headed and rational. If only we stupid Americans would wake up, and realize how much better off we'd be if we succumb to the world's hatred and allow ourselves to lead the lives of those innocent Africans, with their baskets on top their heads, quaint huts made of straw, and their machetes, tyrants, starvation, and early death... 
 THis book was lent to me by a woman I was dating, interestigly enough until just recently, although I suspect we will remain friends. I read this book in the hopes that it would bring insight on how to meet the woman of my dreams or love of my life. That special someone... I think you know what I am talking about.  I have never written a review about a book before and have never felt as compelled to share how much I did not like this book.  Much of how I felt goes along the lines of what other reviewers wrote (The single Stars that is).   I truly believe that relationships are about negotiation and a mesh of differing styles and approaches to your partner,life and its problems. I also know about the subtle use of manipulation to get what you want(I was an adolescent Drug Treatment counselor for 7 years)--- This book had me feeling very angry and feeling like I don't want to be involved with someone who ascribes to some of the main suggestions in this book. As a man interested in doing "the right thing" finding that special person-- I would absolutely not recommend this book.  The book says things that seem practicle and are commonly accepted types of things but then follows up with a twisted and convoluted approach to relationships.    So in closing Guys-- Stay away.. There is another review that suggest some books and I am going to check them out. To women: I wish you the best in finding that man of your dreams, but there has got to be some better choices for advice on relationships. 
 I thought the book was exceptionally short for a body of work lasting 45 years. Great pictures though.   I had some major problems with the writing itself. It's like 45 years went by in a blur and he was an observer and not a participant.   He didn't seem to take much interest in his bandmates, there's very little known about Eddie, Paul, David and Melvin. For a man with the inside track, very little is revealed. The book seems to be more about him and not the Temptations.  He seemed also to forget certain facts, like, David was indeed married when he started seeing Tammi Terrell. When she announced that she and David were engaged back in the early sixties, is when she found out David was already married and couldn't marry her. (This also around the time her headaches started.) I don't what the relationship between Geena and Otis is/was, but for him to leave her and Davids' son out of the book was wrong, totally wrong. He acknowledged the others' wives, why not Geena?  Another thing that disturbed me was Otis' "my way or the highway" attitude toward his group members. Truly adolescent behavior. When he wasn't scouting out women, he was scouting out new talent. (But I guess in his mind it's the same thing). ,"just in case so and so doesn't work out", seems to me, he was waiting on the inevitable. He comes off as arrogant and overbearing. "No one man's bigger than the group." Like Eddie said in the movie, "Who is the group for, who did "it" make sacrifies for?"  OTIS, knows good and well, that he and Melvin could not have carried the group on their own. Eddie, Paul, and David didn't need "the group", as much as "the group" needed them. David and Eddie saw the writing on the wall between Barry and Otis, well before hand and did the smart thing and got out. I wish Paul had as well, alive. Otis should have thought more of his "brothers" and fought for them. He waited too long. Too bad he used the book to trash them when they're not here to defend themselves.  With  three ex-wives and 15 ex-Temps on the roster, maybe it would do Otis good to look inside himself and not place blame everywhere or to everyone.    Paul and Eddie brought style and sophistication and experience. As well as their voices. David, brought the fire and raw sex appeal they needed. And last, but not least, Melvin, with that bottom drawer, under the floor bass. There's no one else like him. Have to give Dennis his "props" too. He may not be an original Temp, but because of him, they got their first of many Grammys to come.   Otis should be more greatful, he and Eddie forged a supergroup we'll never see again. He's not one-fifth as talented as his current or original band-mates. If he could sing, we'd know about it. He's a man that needed a group and he got one. Each man brought with him his own set of baggage, but they were the best.  They will be missed through out time.   Thanks for the music, guys, Where ever you are, (we know you're together) take a bow. We love you 
 I can't quibble with Mann's choices for great one-hit wonders, and the book is fun to flip through; it brings back some good musical memories and he does unearth an occasional interesting fact.  But there are problems.  First, the writing style is poor; phrases like "By the way," "Incidentally," and "Ironically" are sprinkled liberally on virtually every page.  I'm guessing the publisher didn't want to spring for an editor.  Second, the author's idea of research seems to have been to park himself in front of his computer and surf the web, hoping to come up with enough details to fill a book.  Too often, he relies on padding (like telling us what was on the chart at the same time as the song--which gets old and repetitious really fast considering how many of these songs came from the late 80's and early 90's) instead of concentrating on the song or the artist.  For example, he repeats the common claim that "99 Red Balloons" has an anti-nuclear message, but spends absolutely no time discussing the lyrics.  He tells us that songs like "Life in a Northern Town" and "Tubthumping" have quirky and interesting lyrics, but they get virtually no analysis at all.  Finally, and worst of all, he gives no criteria for his ranking.  Clearly, it's not based on statistics like chart life or sales, since "Macerena" and "You Light Up My Life," probably the biggest one-hit songs of all time, are absent from his list.  It would be nice if we had some idea of how he came up with his list.  Like my review title states, this would have been a fun web page, but as a book, it is eminently disposable 
 While there has never been a completely factual account of the life of Wyatt Earp ("Tombstone" comes the closest), this film is completely fictional. First, Wyatt isn't even married in this version, and he becomes enamored with a woman named Clementine; thus the title. Doc Holliday was a dentist, but in this film, he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves.  As a piece of Western Fiction, this film would be alright, but since it was decided to use the names Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the OK Corral, the entire project is distracting. The only accurate facts in this film, are that there was a Wyatt Earp, a Doc Holliday and an OK Corral. If it wasn't for the excellent performances of Henry Fonda, and especially, Walter Brennen, I would have given this film one star 
 A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

 As one reviewer so eloquently pointed out, Anne Marie Oliver and Paul Steinberg show a complete disregard for political and social factors in their extremely superficial and biased analysis of suicide terrorism. In order to describe the true motives behind suicide attacks, one must look into the root causes of suicide terrorism. Contrary to popular belief, a typical suicide bomber is not a religious zealot seeking to destroy the West because he abhors our liberal values. In point of fact, most suicide bombers are secular individuals, as corroborated by the fact that the group responsible for most suicide attacks in the world the Tamil Tigers are adamantly opposed to religion. Admittedly, religion is often used as a tool to recruit new suicide bombers by promising them eternal life in paradise. Nonetheless, religion is by no means a primary motive behind suicide terrorism. While its importance should not be downplayed or denied, it only plays a secondary role.   Robert Pape has in my opinion conducted the most meticulous and comprehensive study of suicide terrorism. What makes Pape's study so superior to every other book on suicide terrorism is that it refuses to make simplistic and unsubstantiated claims. It delves deep into the root causes of suicide terrorism and is not afraid to ask the dangerous questions. Pape's study demonstrates without a doubt that most suicide bombers are driven primarily by political motives. According to Pape, the principal motive of suicide bombers is to obliterate the presence of foreign powers from the areas that suicide bombers consider to be their homelands. Therefore, simply labeling a Palestinian suicide bomber as a religious fanatic driven solely by religious motives is a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification. Most Palestinian suicide bombers have divulged that their primary motive is to fight the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and to relieve the suffering of their people. They believe that the only way to fight a much more powerful adversary is to resort to suicide missions. In the view of the Palestinian suicide bombers all targets are legitimate since they are at war with Israel. They also believe that they have the right to retaliate against the Israeli killing of the Palestinian children and women which Israel by the way conveniently labels as the "collateral damage".   Understanding suicide terrorism does not suggest in any way that it is morally justifiable. But if we really wish to understand its root causes then we must tell the truth and refrain from making sensationalistic albeit incorrect and misleading conclusions. People who live under the Israeli occupation are subjected daily to humiliation and derogatory comments. They live in abject poverty where desperation, despair and hopelessness are omnipresent. It is out of these gruesome conditions that suicide terrorism emerges. Imagine being humiliated and mistreated every day in your own country by an extremely powerful bully. What would you do?   All these factors are somehow overlooked or at best downplayed in this book. Subsequently, the conclusions are erroneous, inaccurate and biased. I recommend Robert Pape's brilliant book Dying to Win The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism and John Esposito's Unholy War Terror in the Name of Islam. In addition to these books, I recommend an extremely powerful and disturbing movie Paradise Now.     
 this book wasn't that good.. in fact it isn't just good. the topic has been covered before and, to me, it was like i was reading those portions again only drawn out.  there was nothing new to the story or even the way the author told it.  i regret having bought the book and not sure i would recommend it even for someone to check out, free, at a library 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Let's start with what most know about the Chappaquiddick incident before they read this book:  Ted Kennedy was at a regatta near Chappy; he probably had too much to drink; he went to a party with former employees of his brother Bobby; he left with Mary Jo Kopechne; he drove off a bridge; he survived; she died; he delayed reporting the accident; he wasn't forthcoming about what happened; the police and the prosecutors were ineffective;  Ted Kennedy's national political aspirations ended.  After struggling through approximately four hundred pages of sometimes repetitive reading, that's all I still know.  If you want to read a book this long to come away with very little insight into what caused the accident, you've come to the right place 
      I was reading the reviews for this book, both 11th edition and 10th edition, and was surprised to be the only reviewer that disagrees with the quality of this book. The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably.       The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey "down home" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered.       In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook. If you enjoyed "The Worldly Philosophers" by Robert Heilbronner, you'll like reading this book. But to use it as an Economics textbook, BIG MISTAKE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST TEXTBOOKS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY COLLEGE SUBJECT OUT THERE.      I give it an F or 1 out of 5. 
 This tape definitely provides a good workout, but it lacks any kind of excitement. There's no complexity to the moves, and I don't find Kathy Smith to be an inspiring or engaging leader. I would not recommend this tape for anyone who's been stepping for more than a year 
 clint eastwood directed this labor of love about jazz great charlie parker. like most labors of love, its a failure in appealing to all but true devotees. i shall comment here about jazz buffs: there are no more obnoxious fans of any art form than the fans of jazz. it is perfectly fine that they choose to discuss among themselves arcana like recording dates, side men, and the like. all fans of various art forms do that in their own little world, but jazz buffs expect the rest of us to listen to them and are positively insulted when we begin to yawn. ok, back to the movie; speaking of yawns ... 
 I was excited to locate a book that targeted exactly what I was trying to achieve.  Medical Billing Marketing.  Not just marketing, but Marketing for my business.  So I ordered it, even paid the extra $10 to get it here STAT!    Once I got it it appeared to be an owners manual of some sort...but "dont judge a book by its cover"  Once I opened it, I began to read, many of the Only 33 pages on marketing. The information was redundant, and spent telling you how a doctoers office works???  Than not to follow up with prospects????  Than to just walk in drop a card, and hope that someone remebers its around if they are ever in the market?????  That was the worst sales/marketing advice I have ever been given!  Finally hitting home the newest concept of Electronic billing, which is not new in my neck of the woods.  So also outdated!    The next 10 or so pages are a glossery of very basic terms we should all be aclimated with.    The final pages are them trying to sell you more informative products..  In short, go to your local bookstore and find the book, "Making Friends with Big Bird and the Sesame Street Gang"  It will be more informative, and you can also share it wioth the kids!      
 + sturdy construction + intro to many topics + problems at end of chapter have page reference of the answer   - shallow coverage of too many topics - some key learning points are left to the student in an intro book - poor formatting and organization  = an intro book that doesn't build enough on the foundations and tries to cover too much in this growing fiel 
 "Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off" and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a letdown 
 For a long awaited, monumental study of the South's road to disunion, you had best keep waiting. This is one tough read. There is good history here but this author is very complicated and has a hard time saying just what is on his mind. Was the story really this complex? Yes, it really was. But is it necessary to make a complex series of events murky and unclear? I don't think so. Freehling is a good historian but this is a far cry from his finest effort 
 This is a strange book that includes a lot that is new and makes for compelling reading.  But it is an unreliable book and for that reason cannot be recommended.  It is replete with errors.    I want to mention a few because I believe they are both symptomatic and sufficiently important to undermine the value of the book. For example, when discussing President Kennedy's assassination on page 3, Woods describes Mrs. Kennedy's "green suit still splattered with her husband's blood," while on page 418 he describes "her pink suit splattered with her husband's brains..."  Trivial?  Unnecessarily tasteless, certainly, but more than a trivial mistake.  Surely even Woods has seen what is probably the most viewed amateur movie film in history...in color.  In another example, Woods puts Hitler's death at April 7, 1945 "with the Red Army advancing on the outskirts of Berlin."  Before Roosevelt's death?  This isn't just a matter of memorizing dates.  Sequence is essential to historical understanding.  Hitler committed suicide on April 30, after Roosevelt's death, and with the Red army within meters of the bunker, not in the suburbs.  Again, not a trivial mistake. There are more.   On one page he informs us that John Stennis was the Senator from Mississippi and on another page from Alabama.  How can anybody with a memory of the civil rights movement possibly forget the Senator from Mississippi?   The errors extend to style, as well.  Evidently pleased with himself, Woods describes DeGaulle over and over again as "le grande Charles," turning the French President into a grammatical hermaphrodite.  Well, you get the point.  There is more needed here than good editing.  The book reads as if it was researched by uncommunicating groups of graduate students with too little knowledge of facts, stuck together by an inattentive author who has an insufficient sense of his period so necessary for context and understanding, and reviewed by an over-hasty editor who can't remember on page 4 what he read on page 3.  For these reasons, this book is unreliable as history and one has to wonder what its value is.  Perhaps just an entertaining read.    
 I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead.  PROs: -Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system) -Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one)  CONs: -FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again. -DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista. -INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids? -ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista.  BOTTOM LINE: 1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE 2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now... 3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple 
 I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.  One San Francisco reviewer even claimed "We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like." According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although "billions of people" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.  But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.  Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens "over there" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.   But what would the "ban DDT no matter what the cost" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue "we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?  Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about "long term damage to the environment" and "resistance to insecticide" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.  And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world "we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day. 
 Warning: Contains Spoiler  I was hooked from the first sentence: "You see, I needed to go to hell." I felt like some people when they see a bad car wreck; you know you're going to see something ugly, but you look anyway. Could anything be worse than "You see, I needed to go to hell?" YES! And it was the very next sentence: "I was, you might say, homesick." It gushed with pretense. I cringed with embarrassment for the writer, yet I kept reading.   The sentences kept coming like ammunition from an assault weapon: "I was born to smoke opium." Tosches must have liked that sentence himself because he repeated three times on one page. And it was a small page because, you see, this isn't really a book, it's a short story with a hard cover. And Tosches isn't just born to smoke opium. He explains he was born to smoke it in "dark, brocade-curtained, velvet cushioned places of luxurious decadence...(among) lovely loosening limbs draped from the high-slit cheongsams of recumbent exotic concubines of sweet intoxication." Such flowery prose. It flows as if it's direct from the pen of a teenage dandy writing down his fantasy for a wet dream.  Midway through the book Tosches arrives in Bangkok. In his search for opium he finds himself surrounded by three young (perhaps, underage) sex workers. One of the girls is stroking his crotch, another masturbates while wagging her tongue and the third is having her nipple squeezed between the old writer's thumb and forefinger. Eventually he becomes "bored with Nana" (I have to assume he is referring the prostitute in Zola's Rougon-Macquart series.) It seems important (and quite distracting) for Tosches to let his reader know that he is aware of many things. He makes sure to mention Jean Cocteau, Milton Freidman and Emanuel Kant all in one tiny story. Nonetheless, I keep reading. I feel the guilty pleasure of a teenage girl reading a Jacqueline Suzanne novel. It's so bad, it's good. It's so very bad.    But let me be kind, if you like Hunter S. Thompson, you might like Tosches, just as if you like Faulkner you might enjoy reading writings from the Faux Faulkner contests. Dr. Thompson is an excellent journalist and takes you on the ride with him. You're there among the Hell's Angels or in the Las Vegas heat with a crazy lawyer. Tosches is more like tour guide who sits a little too close to you and constantly taps you on the shoulder with a Hey-did-I-mention-I'm-one-jaded-bastard? Hey, did you know I'm a smart guy? Listen, listen, I can analyze a subject like it's under a Bunsen burner and I heat it up until it becomes a vapor and all but evaporates.   Anyway, here's the spoiler: Tosches never finds the opium den of his dreams, but he does find the dark sticky ball and the proper pipe to smoke it with. Perhaps he was born to smoke opium for medicinal reasons. He tells us in the beginning of the story that he's diabetic and it was brought to his attention opium was once considered to be effective in the treatment of diabetes.   Tosches is not a brave man. He covers his bases. He must have learned something from Jim Hogshire. He made sure his experimentation wasn't done on U.S. soil and he names no names, no roads.   Tosches ends his story with "The lamp is lit, the pipe is tilted. I am home." My last thought was, why didn't he stay there 
 Although I gave "Children of the Self Absorbed" high marks, I feel Nina Brown has made a grave error in writing this book. There is no way to a have a mutually satisfying relationship with a partner who has narcissistic personality disorder.  These "people" are void of empathy and are the center of their own universe.   You are nothing more than supply to  them, you are there to serve their egos.  If you take Brown's advise here and stop "feeding " them, they move on to a new victim.  They can not love anyone and will not love you.  I suppose if this is what you're looking for and you don't mind being an object, not a person, go for it.  I just can't imagine why anyone who knows the insidious nature of narcissism, would ever want to teach you how to have a relationship with  one.  Narcissists are abusers and you need to remove yourself from their grasp, not learn how to live within it.  
 The DVD is really a deception. All the experts invited are the ones that support Gnostic theory. I was hoping that I can see a balanced view related to this subject. Instead, I only see the point of view of the pro Dan Brown's experts. I think we should invite the famous evangelists, theologists, and scholars from the protestant, cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue. The DVD does not even discuss why the Gnostic theory was rejected in the first century. 
 These cards were supposed to be tournament quality.  They weren't.  My $5 Rook cards purchased at Walmart are higher quality!  I was also dissappointed by the fact that the deck I purchased was missing the Red One.  Returned the set I purchased for myself as well as one that I had purchased as a gift for my Rook-loving brother 
 This playhut was very frustrating for our children. My children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position. Our trouble began when we turned it into a tent. The sleeping bag is one side of the tent. It's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play. After about ten minutes, the playhut was turned over and on the ground. We returned it.. 
 This is literally the ONLY Prince album that gets less than three stars from me, y'all. I love the man an' his eccentric genius, but the material here was just not hittin' for me. It's flawlessly performed as all his work is (the man is the most sheer perfectionist in the biz, which makes his incredibly-prolific output all the more impressive an' mind-blowing), but, in spite of it all, this one jus' left me flat an' uninspired. The stabs at electro-rock an' rap on 'Loose' an' 'Race' respectively jus' don't do it for me on this outing (the latter topic he tackled to much better effect on his next effort in the form of 'We March') an' even a slower ballad like 'Space', while technically well-crafted, lacks the real SOUL to get you enthusiastic about it. This album's definitely dark as others have mentioned an' not for mainstream appeal, but thas' NOT why I don't really like it (y'all should know me by now!). And as I keep stressing its flawlessly-performed. My disappointment is in the sheer BLANDNESS of its perfection. (Yea, so maybe that doesn't make sense, but it sounded good in my head, so I'm stickin' with it!)      There are however two tittilating numbers on here that make this almost worth having. The grandiose epic title track 'Come' for those "18 an' over", is a slinky 10-minute-plus groove with a hypnotic horn-and-rhythm section. The other is the searing story of parental abuse an' neglect he tells on 'Papa'. Prince has the amazing ability to find new ways to sum up life an' mankind in general with jus' a couple lines, an' he does this on jus' about every album, even the lesser ones like this one. Here on 'Papa' he gives us words to live by: "Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same, Every single one of us knows some kind of pain." 
 I bought this dish about 6 months ago and use it on a regular basis.  However, when baking some fish at moderate oven temperature (375), it split into two separate pieces with a loud "crack"; there was no extreme temperature changes either. Go figure 
 I thought this album would be better.  Sure it has all the hits that a casual fan of the band would want to have on one disc.  That's the problem with the album.  There isn't any good songs once you listened to the "hits" with the exception of the song "send me an angel"  Their cover of the Who's "I Can't Explain" is not listenable it all.  To sum this review up.  I dissapointed with it has a whole.  Buy it at your own risk!!!! 
     I don't know what the author's intentions were in writing this book, but it certainly seems as though the life of Lester Young was not the main topic.  Daniels spends more time on topics like racism and the unfair treatment of black musicians rather than actually talking about Lester Young.  While it is important to talk about these topics in some detail to explain how it affected Lester Young, the author did not have to spend over half the book on them.  Here's a little advice Mr. Daniels: If you're going to write a book on the racial inequalities of these times, write a book specifically on that, and with a title that suggests that topic.  Don't write a book with a title of "The Life and Times of Lester "Pres" Young" and spend nearly the whole time talking about racism and racial inequalities. 
 On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top.  For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1.  For quality of product 3.  The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price 
 One could right an honest right-wing history, I suppose, by sticking to the facts.  Paul Johnson's propaganda is simply lying.  As just one instance of this, Paul Johnson assures the reader that President Johnson was reluctant to escalate the Vietnam War.  He further assures us:  "There is no evidence, as was later alleged, that the incident was contrived, to get America deeper into the war."   And further:  "But congress, by an overwhelming majority, passed . . . the "Tonkin Gulf Resolution' authoring the President to take vigorous measure to protect US forces."  One would think that if he going to make such a claim that he should at least explain why the Pentagon Papers so explicitly state that the official account of the Tonkin Gulf attack was a deliberate deception.  In the October HARPER'S article, "The Next War," Daniel Ellsberg claims to have had drawerfuls of critical working papers, memos, estimates, and detailed escalation options revealing the evolving plans of the Johnson Administration for a wider war, expected to commence soon after the election."  Though far more inclined to trust Ellsberg than Johnson, either Paul or Lyndon, I admittedly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth, but I have not heard that the Pentagon Papers were not genuine.      When Johnson is not simply lying, he uses facts to support a viewpoint which he himself must know to not be true.  "Support for intensifying the war was always greatest among the under thirty-fives," (at least prior to November 1968, "by which time the decision to get out had already been taken)."  (By whom)?  Considering that the young had been nursed on heroic World War II movies, trained in blind "patriotism" and educated in such a manner as to preclude questioning governmental authority, what else was to be expected?  Once we woke up to what had been done to us, we, the American People, most definitely lost our stomach for the war.  With "historians" like Paul Johnson, it is not surprising that another generation has been duped.   (Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE)  
 I have a good grounding in photography and was hoping for more detailed instruction on product photography. I learned practically nothing. There is a lot of very elementary filler material on general photography, digital cameras and editing software and Internet. The photos are not that great either. May be somewhat useful for someone who has no knowledge at all of these topic 
 One would like to believe that a group of MIT students truly did take Vegas for millions as Ben Mezrich claims. But in a era when diarists and autobiographers are routinely getting caught in lies, it's very difficult to believe this story. First, it reads like a bad pulp novel, filled with every possible B-movie cliche--security room beatings, casino owners waving guns in their faces on Aruban golf courses, swarthy Europeans threatening to kill them if they ever come back to Monte Carlo. Mix in a cast of characters straight out of central casting--the Russian math genius, the bombshell blond, the screwup with a drug problem, the obese nerd, and the charismatic mystery "leader" who hides hundreds of thousands of dollars in laundry baskets all over the greater Boston area. Then add sexual misunderstandings and B-movie "dialogue," and the author's own self-indulgent "visits" to Vegas brothels and casinos to "retrace" the kids' journey, and you get a far-fetched potboiler seemingly untethered to verifiable facts. Why, for example, did Mezrich not interview the kids' nemesis, a Vegas private eye who follows their movements and foils their plans everywhere they go? Why are there no interviews with security guards and casino managers who roughed them up in Vegas, Aruba, and Monte Carlo? How do we can believe that any of these people even existed, and that any of this is true, when Mezrich swallows their tale hook line and sinker? Read this entertaining but ultimally vacuous trifle for what it is--all bluff and fluff.  
 I never received the large bowls. The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening eithe 
 It says a lot when a young band's debut album is copy-protected. The record company seems to broadcast to the entire world that Kasabian are the next big thing, so you better get in line and BUY the thing now. Thanks to my local library, I found out the real reason for slapping a copy-protection on this album thereby moving more units: Kasabian are lame.  We are now officially in the 21st century. And as a listening audience, we're hard-pressed to be taken by brat rock anymore. Yeah, Kasabian have an attitude. They mouth off about other rock stars, good for them. They also play innocuous, vanilla brit-pop that takes a simplistic, single idea and drives it into the ground. After listening to this label-guarded turkey, these are the only merits that come to mind for these guys.  It's all getting to be a bit much. Every couple of months and we're treated to another juvenile band from the UK who think they can dominate the world by singing about 'gihls.' Between this and the Artic Monkeys, when will it cease? Where have you gone, Blur?  Even if this didn't have a copy-protection on it, I don't consider it to be CDR worthy 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 I am a business person and I thought this book would be helpful to me in making better presentations--which often involve graphic representation of quantitative data. The book was way too serious though. I'm not saying it's a bad book, but it's clearly geared toward someone who wants to go in-depth on the topic--not someone who just wants some quick tips on better business presentations 
 I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that "funny lines do not a good book make." The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the "erotica" is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd. It barely qualifies as a good beach read, and I felt like I needed a bath upon finishing it. I gave it two stars for the humor. But really--dumb, dumb, dumb 
 I found this songbook to be most unimpressive as far as faithful recreations of the songs and only worthwhile to get if there's no alternative. Not only are the arrangements not true to the original harmonies, but whole verses and introductions are left out, and the keys are drastically changed (sosmetimes as much as a fourth lower), which gives the wrong impressions as to the how the song should sound, and the type of voice suited to the song. According to the keys in this songbook, the role of Sarah Brown was sung by an alto when in reality it's a soprano role. Also, I question the leaving out of "Marry the Man Today", one of the best songs in the show. The photos of the different productions at the beginning of the book are nice, but they don't make up for its musical shortcomings 
 I'm bemused as to why almost everyone put a good review on this CD. Cristina's vocals are probably the worst I've heard in any other LC album. Most of the time it just sounds like she wants to get the damn CD over with. The lyrics are ridiculous in some spots, such as when Cristina sings the line "I'm a loser" five monontonous times. And the overall album doesn't vary much at all. All the songs sound alike. This album let me down 
 This book delivers many promises (and helps to re-kindle hope in a "cure"), but is overly simplistic.  I found it difficult to escape my insomnia even with following the guidelines in this book.  It is better than some books on this subject, but not the one that I would recommend.  The book called "Say Goodnight to Insomnia" helped me the most 
 Did not help! I'm still fat and ugly! Email and help me please 
 This doll is very difficult to program. The child (or adult)must speak very loudly to be recognized by the doll. It repeats the same phrases over and over 
 Like the Donny & Marie and Donny companion compilations, this cd sounds just dreadful.  Like so many other recent reissues, the person doing the remastering tried to make these recordings sound as "modern" as possible, meaning that they have eliminated what little dynamic range was present to begin with on these recordings and also set the EQ so that the tonal balance is on the extremely bright side.  Donny's voice, for example, is thin and harsh sounding.  This is the worst sounding Osmonds collection I've heard, and I have everything Curb has issued on cd.  Avoid this one at all costs 
 Ok, the Greg Duli thing has gone on way to long.  Is it me or does every song he writes/sings sound the same?  He has not sung a decent song since his "Helen Highwater" days...and even then it was all cover songs.  The songs in "She Loves You" remind me of a "Warhol" painting.  It's basicly a product (like Cambell's Soup) that you seen over and over in print or illustrations, then he blasts music on top of a sub-par voice and calls it a masterpiece.  I assume that's why he moved to Cali as they are so "culture starved" he can pass it off as art.    He talks of his pain and draws from his experiences of life.  I can remember Duli running home crying because the braces on his teeth came loose while sled riding.  I am sure soon we shall see a song called "Trauma in the snow on the river bank", read interviews in trade rags on how it "changed him so", and see pictures of him in the snow...with a smoke in hand of cours!   I understand that he has found a following of lost souls such as his, reaching for some truth to this life...all waiting for him to unvail some beautiful reasoning to "it all."  Unfortunately, he's just a guy from Sharon Park in Hamilton, Ohio, singing for a buck and trying to make you believe he's something other than what he really is.  Admittedly, this sometimes works, as it did for Charles Manson (not comparing the men, only their methods).  But then again, what do I know...I only buy music. 
 These dvd's are a joke. If you want the ORIGINAL full length movies on dvd go on ebay. You will find versions copied from LASERDISC. They are in widescreen, digital quality, original audio and full length. They are superior to the old VHS Copies and much better then these new Dvd's.  Viva la revolution......... 
 I got and idea....Lets just make up theology as we go. I counted seven or so "out of context" scriptures in the first four chapters. See how many you can find. The chapter on the "narrow way" is a big mistake seeing that the author uses only the KJV and no other translation states that "the way" is anything but difficult and "the gate" is what is narrow. Here is another challenge; see if you can find any of this kind of writing prior to the 1800s (and don't say Paul either). Read "Spirit of Promise" by Macleod and then be honest with yourself about what is biblical 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 I did not find this book helpful at all.  I guess I should have known better, but I thought maybe it would have one piece of useful information.  It didn't 
 A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...  Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.  Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.  constance rodrigu 
 32 000 photos to choose from, and this is what he comes up with?? Many of the pictures are black and white, out of focus and grainy. The panorama shots are very poorly composited from smaller pictures. I’ve seen much better seamless versions of the same photo series in other books. Numerous pages are simply empty. Just black. There are many great photos in this book, but they are too few to make it a good buy. A few google searches will turn up many more great photos than you will find in this book.  
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 Hate to break it to you all, but the film is not even close to the true story.  The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY.  His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.  Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter.  Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses.  Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts.  This thing was nothing more than a fictional story.  It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have "USA" applied on them anywhere.  I could go on and on about it, but hey, at least now you know so you are not like so many who are saying "yeah, this is TRUTH!!"  So be sure to do your research, and don't believe everything you hear even though you really, really want to 
 For those who are wondering why the PG rating for this movie, well, I'm wondering too. This is one of the cleanest movies I've ever seen.  Not one utterence of foul language.  Not one utterence of d***, h***, or any irreverence of the use of the word God.  Just a clean, clean movie from beginning to end.  The only scene that I could think of that would draw a PG rating is when the grandfather died and they had a funeral.  Everything connected to this was brief and something I would not object to my children watching.  If there's anything else, I missed it, and I watched this movie intently from beginning to end.   For those who are looking for a true family-friendly movie, this is it. No foul language, no violence, no sexual innuendo.  Nothing that any member of the family could not watch.  Kleenex will be needed though.  
 I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little 
 I recently found these authors and have been devouring the Pendergast series with great enthusiasm. Having worked my way down the list to "Brimstone", I opened the book with great excitement. Unfortunately I closed it with great disappointment. The book started off with a bang, fizzled in the next 400 pages, and a good 1/3 of the book could have been left out entirely. Much as I want to give the book three stars, the ridiculous plot just won't let me. The plot started off interesting and spooky but when the motive for the murder was introduced, it was so mundane and silly, I put down the book and laughed out loud. After that I had to force myself to finish it.   I didn't like Hayward in "Reliquary" because she came across as a tired, clichï¿½d feminist (act tough and swear like a man to get accepted).  The subplot involving her and the equally tired, clichï¿½d "Christian nut cases" was so dull it should be bottled and sold as Valium. Eventually I skipped over all those chapters as they lent nothing to the main plot. The abrupt, exceedingly premature office sex scene between Hayward and D'Agosta was unbelievable from numerous viewpoints: 1) no sexual tension had been allowed to build between them. The sex simply came out of nowhere and was thrown into our faces with all the subtlety of a gorilla at the dinner table. 2) the idea that a "by the book" female police captain would risk her career by having sex in her own office while on duty with a co-worker just didn't ring true. Oddly, the relationship was then dropped until the final pages.   Agent Pendergast, whom I have adored previously, was the only thing that kept me reading, and even he was allowed to go so far off the deep end (he deduces the entire murder motive from a piece of horsehair - Come on!) that he lost the endearing characteristics present in the earlier books. Even the attempt to introduce Viola as a love interest for Pendergast failed (they looked into each others eyes for a breathless minute - PUH-lease!). Please guys, no more romance. Stick with what you do best and leave the romance to Danielle Steele. 
 Yet another example of someone invoking Christanity in order to sell a sub-par effort. This is the second time I have bought a book with Christian reference and the second time I have been ripped off. While this book has a catchy title, it is not worth opening. The title can be read for free. I highly suggest you stop there and save your money! 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 One star is too generous!  AAARRRGGGH!  I am still mad about this book and I read it 3 books ago!  I loved Ted Dekker's "Three" and I enjoyed Peretti's children's books I read with my kiddos, so I was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration.  But it was utterly silly!  If I start a book, I have to finish it.  Okay, that's my own fault, but I had to MAKE myself read this to get it over with!  I wanted to burn the book when I was finished to make sure nobody else I knew ever read my copy.   The ending?  Well, "Shoo!  Get out of here!"  was embarrassing!  Shame on you, Frank and Ted 
 ***Spoilers Ahead***  Towards the end of the book I was absolutly positive there HAD to be another installment in the series because it kept going with no resolution in sight.   Unfortunatly, I was wrong.  In a typically Mercedes Lackey move the book goes on and on and on, following the characters practically day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute and then ends abruptly.   I honestly felt there was no point to most of what I read. It seemed that half of the book was spent following Kellen as he travelled from place to place and back again while he whined over how ruthless he was becoming. Then we spent another good portion of the book reading about Savilla torturing various creatures and walking around naked. And finally, Jermayan, who also seemed to spend half his time just travelling back and forth between cities and camps and so forth. Oh, and let's not foget Cilarnen, who spend most of the book holed up in one place of another while he fiddles around with all his new books and equipment.  Then we get to the end, the final battle, the culmination of all our effort in reading through hundreds of pages of character and plot development....and they wrap it up in MAYBE 30 pages.   There was absolutly no resolution in my mind. It was like the ending was simply an after though: "Oh, yeah, and the good guys win. The end."   The demons are supposed to be a mighty and powerful race but they go down seemingly without a fight. To be honest, I was more intrugued by Kellen and Shalkan fighting the stone mastiffs than I was about the final battle. It was just way to easy, convenient, and stereotypical to be enjoyable.  To end the story, of course, there had to be the relationship resolution. I wasn't bying these flimsy relastionships from the beginning, it was just very fast, very forced and very out of place. So Jermayan gets Idalia....sort of but it was the relationship between Kellen and Vestakia that really got me. They spent most of the trilogy avoiding each other yet somehow manage to fall in love and then at the very end: "Oh, by the way, we can have sex now. I love you."   In all, it was disappointing. Many questions weren't answered and they left a lot of loose threads hanging in their hurry to wrap it all up. If they hadn't spent almost the entire book focusing on the pointless they could have made so much more of it 
 Don't waste your money.  Their first book. Smoke & Spice, was one of the best I own.  The success must have gone to their heads.  It's a shame that they will surely make a lot of money for this poor effort only because of the first books quality 
 Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans.  I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it.  I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs?  Attrocious!  These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll.  The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots.  The production is over the top and bombastic.  Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made.  
 There is no perfect Earth.  The DC universe is corrupt?  Let's see...Joker actually turns out to be a hero (I know, he's not presented as one, but he offs AL, so he's a hero).  Wonder Woman kills someone?  Yeah, right.  Batman actually points a gun at someone?  Yeah, right again.  The big blue schoolboy saves the universe? Hack, ptooey.  Everybody makes mistakes (the big idea from the series along with there's no perfect Earth).  It's too bad that DC didn't realize that this series was one of them 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 I found the book dull.   Neither the story nor the characters were on any interest.   In fact, I found no redeaming qualities in any of the characters.  Had I been a Preppie or a Yalie, I would be pounding on the author's door complaining about how we were portrayed.   The author insisted on using two long words when one short word would do.  I guess that shows his great intellect.  I would not read any of his other books 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 The author tells an interesting story about some of the most known german physicist and their role in the attempt to produce an atomic bomb. Unfortunatelly he does not tell the pure facts, he gives his personal interpretation on each comment made by the germans and tries to make you think that they wanted to produce a bomb at any cost, that one of the most famous physicist, Heisenberg, did not know enough nuclear physics and that everything Heisenberg said, was just to hide his failure. A biassed book 
 I don't know what type of ruler they use to advertize this pan as 10 1/4 inches.  We bought it because our existing T-Fal pan was worn out, and we wanted to keep using the lids that were common to it and other pans.  This thing measures only 9 7/8 on the outside edges.  Inflation? 
 Considered by many who should know (e.g., E. M. Forester)to be Woolf's most brilliant work of genius, The Waves is a challenging book to read for many reasons, not the least of which is the style she has adopted. More like an extended Greek chorus than anything else, the six characters, whose "voices" sound identical to one another, speak their life stories in short, alternating monologues.  Although the writing is very poetic, it is also very dense and very distancing. We never really warm up to any of the characters or get involved in their stories.  I had to read this book for a class and, though I'm glad I made it through to the end, it was difficult going and I know I never would have finished it (or even gotten through ten pages of it) if I hadn't had the carrot of a grade hanging over it. We had to read the whole thing in a week which is really not a good way to tackle this book. Best read in small segments, leisurely, absorbing each moment Woolf choses to highlight. Definitely not a plane or beach book!  If you haven't read Woolf before, this is not the book to start with.  Mrs. Dalloway is, in my opinion, the best and most accessible of Woolf's experimental fictions and a good starting place for access into this great 20th century author's works. Then, if your brave, move onto "To the Lighthouse" and then, shudder, "The Waves. 
 Ok......when I first saw Lazy Town I thought that it was one of the dumbest shows ever. And this DVD proves it. The story is that Sporticus is taking a break as being a super hero, and the bezarre pink-haired Stephine becomes "Sporti-stephine". Ah, that neame kills me. I hate Lazy Town and always will. The songs and dances are corney. The characters are corney, and the acting is corney 
 This particular edition of Bourke's book (I have not checked other editions) exhibits a complete failure of editing.  The subject matter itself is fascinating, but the missing segments and/or pages makes it extremely difficult to maintain flow.  So far there have been a number of instances of editing failure: on page 2 the last word is not finished on the following page and the text is interrupted.  The same thing happens on pages 3, 14, 15, 16, 44, and 88.  These are only the discrepancies I can identify.  I have no idea how much text is actually missing.  All told, don't buy this edition 
 I wish I had read another reviewer's comments because this calendar was not at all what I had expected.  I was hoping for some interesting, fashion-forward patterns and was sorely disappointed; the patterns are not very exciting and there are not many.  Patterns are only offered one day out of the week with the other days having "inspirational quotes", web site suggestions, history bits about knitting and other people's favorite yarns.  If you are looking for a calendar with lots of patterns I would suggest looking into another calendar, Knitting-Pattern-a-Day, which is full of patterns.  If I had flipped through this before I purchased it I wouldn't have bought it 
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 I bought this book as a quick reference for a Technical Support group I manage.  We have a few dozen products that require an installer to run wires throughout a house. Unfortunately, a large majority of the calls I get are wiring related and this book provides tremendous insight into the problems created by improper wiring.  If you want to learn about wiring, this is the book to buy.  I also bought the full book that goes with it.  It must be good because I got the only paperback, and all the used hardback books are almost double the retail price.   From this guide you'll learn everything relating to wiring.  You'll learn balanced vs unbalanced, ground loop isolation vs cross talk, and the list would almost be half as long as the pocket guide.  Simply put, if your livlihood depends upon wiring, this book will help you a great deal.  
 Before all Evanovich fans blast me double barrels, please note: This refers to the audio CD, abridged version of High Five. It was my first J.E. novel & I thought would be the last.  Having read many customer reviews, I might have to try reading one instead of listening.   I found the story to be limp & quite elementary.  Chief problem: the AUDIO CD reader whose lisp is most annoying.  It sounds as though she's auditioning for a part in a high school play...one she won't get.  Or auditioning for the role of "Thindy" Brady of Brady Bunch fame...a part she's destined to play.  Is there something poignant about the selection of this particular reader?  She does Evanovich no justice. The story begins with a missing uncle report...main character "Stephanie's" missing uncle, that is.  Oddly, no one reports that he's missing for 2 days & none seem very concerned about his disappearance.  I found it extremely odd that the family would discuss his absence "over coffecake as is customary in the 'burg in New Jersey."  Pardon me, I'm not from "the 'burg" or NJ but it's really a stretch to believe that everyone from the "'burg" casually discusses the case of a missing relative while dining on coffeecake. Attempts at humor are pathetic, such as: "I got my shower; jumped out & dried my hair by way of styling it."  What????  "Ranger" naturally drives a Ranger (creative genius there).  Stephanie goes on a job & forgets her gun (was I supposed to fret or laugh?  Who knows w/this reader's tonal quality). The novel continues, yet still no one concerns themselves with the missing uncle.  Stephanie sleeps around with carefree abandon but it is tough to take seriously while listening to that lisp!  Characters appear & we really have no clue as to why they immerged onto the scene. (Maybe the clue was in book 1, 2, 3 or 4??) Again, this is the AUDIO version.  The reader's voice works as well as Michael Jackson reading the Da Vinci Code...a no can do! After listening to the audio version of High Five, I can emphatically state: sometimes words are better left unspoken (just read them!) 
 I am using this book for J2EE study. After reading chapter 1 and 2, I have to say this is one of the worst tech books I ever read. The materials are harshly composed, often without a consistent and clear framework on various topics (what an irony on a book about a framework). From time to time, I have the impression that the authors just pulled some paragraphs from various articles and piled them together. This gives me the further impression that the authors don't really understand those subjects well enough to distill the essentials out and present them in an organized manner. Unless you are already an expert in those subjects, you will find yourself confused by this book and walk away with more questions than before.  Definitely not recommended for anybody 
 I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I read the review from 2005 and hoped that was just one bad batch--but it isn't.  The lid is slightly too large and if used on a non-stick pan will damage the non-stick surface since it sits on that instead of the lip of the pan.  So, I have returned it.  Note that this is just a problem with the 8 inch lid; I also bought the 10 inch lid and that one fits perfectly 
 This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it 
 It makes great tea, but the pitchers last about 4 to 6 months before the seam on the front cracks and starts to leak. It would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available. Then I would give it 5 stars 
 Tha Dogg Pound - Cali Iz Active (KOCH, 2006)  And another entry in the long list of this year's disappointing albums from veterans is Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active. Kurupt and Daz still got that chemistry together, though; it's too bad that they're rapping like it's still 1992.  It's really a shame because in the 90's, Kurupt used to be really dope with his and Daz used to rhyme tight and produce tight jams. But on this album, Daz doesn't produce anything (which is already a one-star deduction) and his and Kurupt's rhymes are both uninspired. Overseer Snoop Dogg shows up a few times on here and though I can say the same about his deteriorated rhyme prowess, he steals the show from the Doggs. You can even look at the song titles and tell that this album would be unoriginal ("Sittin on 23z", "Keepin it Gangsta", etc.).  The saving graces on this album are productions by Battlecat (who is still severely underrated) and Soopafly (him too). Also, the Ice Cube-assisted "It's All Hood" adds some life to the party. "Fakina** H**s" featuring and produced by David Banner would also be good if the beat didn't sound like a rip-off of Jay-Z's "Dirt Off Your Shoulder".  If Cali is active, this album should not be proof. How did 2Pac say it? "All you old rappers tryin' to advance/It's all over now, take it like a man." -EJ 
 I bought this DVD based on reviews here on Amazon. I won't fault others for thier position, it's just a matter of personal taste. For me this was a big disapointment. The story leaves a lot to be desired. The character Walker (Lee Marvin) gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn't have. The direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different, but it failed. I'm sorry I bought this DVD 
 I searched for reviews of this movie before I saw it, and didn't find any. People I talked to had not seen it, but had heard it was good. So I finally sat down and watched it. The acting was top notch. It was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships. One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits.  On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women. Kathy Bates' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a "don't push me" type. While much of this was funny, this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground. In spite of this I enjoyed the first part of the movie. That is until the surprise ending. While this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler, the ending involved unwitting cannibalism. This made me sick, and I felt sick a long time after watching it. Had I known how sour the ending would be, I never would have watched this movie 
 Clare Ballenger works as a divorce councellor, helping women find closure as their marriages fall apart, but Clare's own life is not exactly perfect. She lost her husband years before to a hunting 'accident' and has felt guilty ever since. Although two men are madly in love with her, Clare treats both of them as 'friends,' refusing to take their proposals seriously. Meanwhile, Clare's best friend, Dora has gotten back with her husband Son, against Clare's advice. Clare believes that Son can only make Dora unhappy.   Clare's batting average in terms of seeing what's going on around her falls even lower when her daughter's marriage falls apart as well. Still, Clare keeps busy building a retreat center for divorcing and divorced women on land given her by her mother-in-law. There, near the bay, Clare hopes to bring a peace to troubled women that she herself cannot find.   Author Cassandra King writes evocatively of the south, with families who have known one another for generations, instinctual distrust for imported Yankees, still-strained racial relations, and especially a kind of sisterhood. In QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS, women are the only characters with any depth--all of the men, including love interests Rhy and Lex, seem to exist only in their relationship to the women of their life. Indeed, Dory's husband Son refuses to go anywhere without his wife, and Clare's final decision between the two men who love her is driven not by the qualities of these men themselves, but by Clare's relationships with other men.   Although King's writing is strong and occasionally highly emotional, I found the story confusing and the characters sometimes unsympathetic. From the very beginning, when Clare ran out from a restaurant rather than face Son, Clare refuses to confront her own wishes and needs--which could have been the basis for a character arc, but if so, it was one King didn't fully explore.   Although QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS was occasionally frustrating, Kings writing was strong enough to propell me through the story. 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 This silly item requires expensive "concentrators" that don't work particularly well, leaving behind plenty of unpopped kernels. Don't waste your money 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 We saw the movie in the theatre and loved it. The DVD we just purchased was horrible. They chopped out so much of the movie it made it un-watchable. It is only good for a coaster under my drink now 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 Don't get me wrong. I like Hillary. Anyone who was a first lady pushing broom behind Bill, then deciding that wasnt enough and got elected to the Senate to reperesent people from New York has to have nothing but guts or a lot of stupidity. The latter she most certainly is not. A writer...? Not really. At least in the autobiographical sense. This book is too too too full of sweet and syrup and praise and love and admiration and high regard and laughter and tears of joy and feel good and hugs and and and and and... Doesnt anything really piss this woman off?? I know it does but you wont see it in this book. I KNOW that a sitting Senator and perhaps Presidential candidate is going to be real carful about what people and issues they talk about. Positive or negative. Politicions writing books about themselves and their professions are done so that no one gets offended or forgotten. Husband Bills book is full of that. Not that were looking for sex and drugs and rock and roll. We'll get all those after they leave office and retire. Hillary has a style that is very good reading if warm, fuzzy and cuddly is what you want in a "its all about me" book. It just didnt leave much of an impression about the person on me. It was more like reading (or being read to) a childrens book for adults. I'd rather Hillary rewrite this book so we can get a look at the real person, not a lot of translucent fluff. If it was TV, it would have come off like a 10 hour interview with Katy Cuoric. Sorry folks to be so negative on this one but the book really did end up reading like a political campaign speech. A good speech though 
 There is almost no science to back up the author's claims about the benefits of companion plants. Most of her book is based on folk tales, myths and assumptions.   A gentleman named Craig Dremann actually studied the effects of companion plants and concluded that carrots detest tomatoes. Carrots do grow well with garlic and radishes but they grow very poorly with tomatoes. Carrots only grew to 6% of normal when interplanted with tomatoes. Tomatoes grew better with carrots so clearly the tomatoes were robbing nutrients from the carrots. Tomatoes also grow better with garlic but the garlic suffers, only growing 35% of normal.  The Craig Dremann booklet with his findings is called "Companion Plants: Carrots Really Detest Tomaotes" and is available from Redwood City Seed Company in Redwood City, CA 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums. It's just a compilation of tracks put on a cd to make money in an easy way 
 The non-functioning illuminating speckles on Illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions. If you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing, go for it. If you're paying more, you're wasting your money 
 As a dumb hard drive this is 1GB for more money than you need to spend. The "U3 CruzerSynch" preloaded application has never been able to transfer the Contact list from my Outlook Express, it crashes...everytime. It's also better to use SyncToy from MS because CruzerSynch only synchs (deletes files deleted from the HD) while SyncToy has a "Contribute" option that never deletes from the destination drive. I contacted "support" I sent them the requested copy of my wab; they've been "working" on it for weeks, I never expect to hear from them. CruzerSynch also, without warning, deleted my address book (Contacts) from my HD. Not good 
 I was livid when I saw this movie after reading the book. It is barely on course with the book. They could have done a much better job with that story. What a waste of good actors like Denzel and Salli Richardson. 
 This has to be pretty much the most worthless book I've ever encountered. It details a vast "conspiracy" against the American people on the part of every reputable scientist who has ever walked on this earth (as vs. Dr. Carter's tame circle of quacks, who are of course perfect in Dr. Carter's estimation despite the fact that their so-called "studies" violate every principle of double-blind controlled research). If you are an adherent of wishy-washy new age "therapies" or you believe that the U.S. government is covering up the "fact" that UFO's are visiting our planet, you'll love this book. If you know a single bit of science, buy this book only for the comic effect 
 The production of the play was terrible.  The acting was even worse.  I was going to show it to my students, but I can't show them that performance.  It was pathetic.  Also, there is no closed captioning.  If you were thinking about getting this version, I highly recommend that you think again 
 I bought this vacuum less than a year ago, and use it weekly or bi-weekly on a small two-bedroom apartment with cats. It was very loud, so much that it scares the dickens out of the cats, but it worked well until three months ago.  That's when its suction was working less and less. I kept thinking, "Wow, I have to vacuum more often, maybe the cats are shedding," or "I can't believe how dirty we've been lately." As it turns out, the vacuum wasn't really picking up items so much as it was either redistributing them around the carpet, or collecting them in the nozzle. As soon as I'd turn it off to store it, things came out all over the place.  I'm frustrated to have to buy yet another vacuum in less than a year's time.   No more Dirt Devils for me 
 Honestly, it is just amazing to me that an author can make money from a publication (I refuse to even refer to this as a "book") with the kind of obvious advice that amounts to "Be careful at night, study hard and eat all  your vegatables".  Don't waste your money on this, this book can be read in 5 minutes in any store without paying for it. Several other reviewers have recommended more helpful and meaty sources of helpful advice for the college student and I concur. Pass this one up 
  Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural'  argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style. 
 My expectation were low for this inexpensive sonic toothbrush, they should have been lower.  Not much sonic or movement of any kind. The brush has a comfortable grip and is lightweight, but so is a $2.10 OralB manual toothbrush 
 I just didn't like this book.  I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET.  Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them.  The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.  Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanity  Con- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.  It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it 
 Jewel Cases are diffucult to open and are extremely fragile 
 I tutor and this is the worst Geometry textbook I've had to use. Geometry is a new branch of mathematics to most students and can be difficult to comprehend. This book only makes it worse. The lack of examples and clear explanation is very frustrating. I empathize with any student forced to endure this text 
 The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.  
 The acting is terrible!!! (Redford should have hung up his spurs after the "Sting"!)  The dialogue is Terrible!!! The Directing is terrible!!!!!!!!  The pace and tempo are out of wack.  They must have spent all their budget on Redford and shiny old cars rather than story, direction, continuity, and production.  AND yet there was so much potential.  My frustration is unbearable!!!  Any movie I can think of is better than "Havana"!!! Try "LA Confidential", "Chinatown", "Casablanca", in fact any Bogart movie...the list is endless!!!  I'd recommend my five year old's "Dumbo" ahead of "Havana".  AHAH!!!  I just had a stroke of genius!!!  Redford crash lands his Gulfstream V in remote Africa and loses his ability to speak, and the chimps nuture him back to health.  The name of the movie, "The Homo Sapien Whisperer".    
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
 It's a good basic overview, but the errors in the code snips are just too frustrating. I bought it because it was recently published (2006). But trying to get PEAR to work (DB.php has been superseded by MDB2.php) and even the simple form were exercises in futility.    If you do use it get an AMP package (google: Uniform Server) and skip the install section. You'd think O'Reilly could include and AMP stack on a CD in the book and use that 20 pages for another exercis 
 Is the United States a Christian country?  Well, not if you believe our Founding Fathers, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin.  They argued for complete separation of church and state.   And Wills is actually quite good at telling us what Madison, the most important of them in this regard, said.    But America does have plenty of Christians.  And Wills claims (in 1990) that polls show nine out of ten Americans believe in god.  As a Polytheist who regards such a belief atheistic, I find that a discouraging statistic, but that does not mean it is untrue.  Wills also argues that an atheist (who does not believe in any Goddesses or Gods, not even the monotheist one) would have no chance of being elected President (presumably being a candidate without a prayer).  Given what Adams and Jefferson said about Christianity in their letters to each other, I doubt that either of their positions would get them elected today.  Wills discusses the issue of the words in our Pledge of Allegiance, including the reference to the monotheist god.  I do think symbols are important.  Our flag does not have a Christian Cross on it, and that's intentional.  And I do not understand either side in this dispute.  Do the Christians really want to be on the wrong side of Madison's arguments and demand that Polytheists refer to the monotheist god?  Do non-monotheists really want to appear unpatriotic by refusing to salute their own flag because of these words?  The author then moves into the debate over Darwinian evolution.  And he contrasts William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial not so much with Clarence Darrow as with H. L. Mencken.  Willis is quick to criticize Mencken's completely politically incorrect attacks on Women, Jews, and Blacks.  Well, maybe I am just too tolerant.  I agree that Mencken's style was like Nietzsche's.  But I find their works thought-provoking rather than parts of a demonic theology!    Wills then claims that the real winners of the Scopes trial were not the Darwinians.  He is right about that.  After the trial, the quality of American biology textbooks went way down.  Wills says "it was not Scopes that put evolution in the schools, but Sputnik."  That is true.  The author then argues in favor of putting creationism into the science classroom.  I am disappointed with Wills for wanting to do this.  We're not talking about a ritual Pledge to our Flag here.  We're talking about teaching falsehoods in science classes.  Shame on him!    There is also a discussion of Jesus, including the virgin birth, miracles, and resurrection.  By the way, I have always thought these made Jesus less heroic and more attackable.  After all, without any of this, who would dream of comparing Jesus with powerful people such as Stalin or Mohammed or Julius Caesar?  Jesus would be a simple hero and no one would find cause to demonize him.    Wills is not afraid to talk about abortions and a Woman's Right to Choose.  My only comment on this is to say that I can't see an argument for an embryo being sacred in the first few hours after fertilization, before we even know if it will be twins or not.  It is an interesting book, but the comments about creationist arguments are simply wrong.  Even if Wills is being sincere and merely in error here (rather than being reckless or dishonest), I can't give him more than one star for this book after that 
 This was supposed to be a brand-new item, but the cover was torn 
 This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 If I could give it 0 star, I would. My humble opinion is that Kaspersky is not better than Norton at slowing down your computer. One brand new computer, plenty of space and memory. One old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well. Each time Kaspersky updates, I can't open Outlook Express nor Explorer. Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement. Samwis 
 Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke 
 I ordered this book in June and here it is August and I have never received it. I never have any problems with the private dealers they are prompt and efficient. Don't know why it should be any different from amazon. Last tracking I could find on it was in Phila. some where. I don't live in Phila., nor do I have time to spend tracking. If I had that kind of time I would just go to the store 
  Pros:  Organized well.  Lots of excellent photographs.  The section on insects was well done.  Cons:  Nothing new.  The section on techniques provided basic, but very limited, information.  The video was very amateurish.    
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 This Movie takes a big flaming tird on the MK series I mean How could Ed Boon let them do this. This Movie suck's dont ever watch it. It has Power ranger fighting and the cast stinks. The First one is the best 
 This is one of many required books for my class on Applied Simulation.   I did not like the book. I thought the author was a "windbag". If you must buy it get a used version.   A better book to read is definitely Jared Diamond's " Guns, Germs and Steel" Excellent!  and  "Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace"   by Janet H. Murra 
 I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.   The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her "supposed insights" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.   The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.   Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the "Mummy" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.   Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb. 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Boot Hill has nothing to do with the other two "Trinity" movies really. Boot Hill is the last in a trilogy of Colizzi films starting with "God forgives, I don't" and "Ace High".  The "correct" Trinity series would be (more or less): They call me Trinity and Trinity rides again. There is no such thing as a part three to that.  The best Boot Hill DVD on the American market is that of Wild East, but it's not a totally uncut version.  www.spaghetti-western.ne 
 this movie was soooo boring and not only that put even the ending didn't put means to the movie what a waste of seeing hte movie or even renting it trash 
 Like most of the critical writing that is accruing about McCarthy's work these days, reading these essays invites the observation that academic commentary on great works of literature all too often appears as a perverse  sort of alchemy, an attempt to tranform bronze into excrement.  While  merely vexatious for those familiar with McCarthy's work, these  institutionally sanctioned forms of obfuscation,  however well-meaning, are  a tremendous dis-service to the uninitiated.  McCarthy's ambition is  biblical, ungodly; thus, his work is robustly defiant -- even scornful --  of contemporary professional exegesis 
 I bought this straightener because I wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp. However, while it is not a horrible product, I have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better. I would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store. This isn't any better than those 
 There are two good reasons why I oppose the concept of a completely Good, Omniscient, and Omnipotent (GOO) God:  (1) Acceptance of this God insists that the petty-minded cruelty of God as described in the Old Testament is actually love.  If Christians refuse to acknowledge that Moses invented the tradition of ethnic cleansing, and that this was evil, it is too easy to justify applying this concept to native Americans, Jews, and Moslems, as has been done throughout history, and  is being done at the present time.  (2)  Rejection of this God usually entails rejection of any notion of God, and acceptance of the doctrine that we are merely machines whose existence is accidental.  So while I cannot pretend that I studied Plantinga's attempt to reconcile God and evil with an open mind, I tried to be at least fair.  His argument not only fails, it is silly.  I shall explain why as briefly as I can.  The analogies that Plantinga chooses to support his case are odd to say the least.  The fact that a theist does not know why God permits evil says nothing about the rationality of the belief.  We also do not know how the desire to mow the lawn leads to the bodily motions of mowing the lawn, yet it is rational to suppose there is a connection.  True, but if the desire mow the lawn led instead to sticking one's hands in the whirling blades and hacking them off, we would consider that irrational.    Since God is GOO, he will eliminate all evil that he can that does not entail eliminating an outweighing good or bringing about a greater evil.  Suppose I am deliriously happy, and my friend Paul has a sore knee.  God cannot eliminate Paul's pain without also eliminating my happiness.  It's impossible to imagine why God cannot do this, unless Paul's pain makes me happy.  Admitting this example to be trivial, Plantinga suggests that heroism in the face of evil is inspirational, and this heroism would be eliminated by the absence of evil.  Facing evil with heroism is good, but the absence of evil is clearly better.    The good that prevents God from eliminating evil is free will.  Since no argument can be better than its major premise, free will needs to be scrutinized.  Inasmuch as nearly all atheists dismiss free will as a delusion, Plantinga's argument is obviously not meant for them.  My conviction is that free will does exist, but only in the same way that the ability to do calculus exists; it requires a lot of hard work and few people ever develop it to any extent.  At best, one's free will is confined within the limits of one's character, and Plantinga's claim that predictability has nothing to do with free will is clearly false.  For instance, the average white man in 1850's Georgia insisted that slavery was completely consistent with Christian morality and no rational argument could have convinced him otherwise, while the opposite would have been true for his counterpart in Maine.  People with free will do not permit their characters to be molded by arbitrary cultural circumstances.  We might be free to do what we want, but is what we want really a free will choice?  Christians acknowledge that wanting to sin is beyond their control.  But only evil people want to do heinous things.  How many men want to crush a woman's skull with a tire iron and rape the corpse, as Ted Bundy did?  Was the desire to do this Bundy's free will choice?  Plantinga acknowledges that God might interfere with Maurice's decision to have oatmeal for breakfast by inflicting him with an equine obsession that makes it psychologically impossible for him to refuse oats.  I am by no means convinced that Bundy did not suffer from a more sinister obsession.    At any rate, since God knows who will "choose" to become evil, why not NOT CREATE THOSE PEOPLE?  Plantinga ignores this question.  He says, "God could not have created any of the possible worlds containing just the persons who do in fact exist, and containing moral good but no moral evil" (p.48).  He claims that God cannot create a world in which people do not have "transworld depravity."  I had to reread Plantinga's explanation of transworld depravity several times before I could convince myself that he actually says what he actually says.  Stripped of the obfuscating logical symbols of which he is so fond it goes like this:  There are two worlds identical in every way except in one Bundy kills the woman, and in the other he doesn't.  But if the world in which he doesn't kill the woman is going to be as much like the actual world as possible, then if this world were actual, then he would have killed the woman.  It says nothing except that if Bundy actually exists, and he has free will, he must kill the girl.  It is a fatuous argument that never addresses why Bundy should be obsessed with evil in the first place.    Plantinga argues that natural disasters that we typically refer to as "acts of God" are actually the free will acts of demons.  Although earthquakes are explained quite well by plate tectonics, Plantinga insists it is not irrational to insist demons pushing the plates around.  This is so inane I cannot even comment on it.

 I was forced to watch this movie for college.  It was the most vulgar, unnecessary piece of junk I have ever seen.  This is a perfect example of the demoralization of America 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor 
 I have read General Giap's work both in the original Vietnamese and in English.  There is little to no valuable insight contained within the political dogma and Party rhetoric that fills this puffed-up praise of General Giap.  The reader should keep in mind this work was not originally published to discuss the strategy and tactics of the final push to capture the Republic of Vietnam.  Instead, it was published to praise General Giap and portray him to the Vietnamese people as a hero of the Communist Party who outwitted and defeated the foreign invaders, thus placing Giap in a class with other heroes of Vietnamese history such as Le Loi and the 2 Trung Sisters.  This is NOT a serious analysis of the final events of the Vietnam war, and offers little promise other than to satisfy a curiosity for how the Communist Party interprets history for the people of Vietnam 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
  Just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it. The first movie I ever walked out of,and I was home!!!! THE PITS!!!!!!! 
 Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city 
 The Carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good.  No matter how careful or how I adjust my grip, water/coffee leaks from the top and down the side.  I have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter 
 This text, in my estimation, is a very poor choice for a college level introductory course on ethics, which, I am told, is sadly the purpose for which it is most read.  The first chapter attempts to introduce the reader to the notion of morality by examining three difficult moral questions, and the arguments presented by each side.  He goes further than this, however, by simply informing the reader, in inimitably straightforward prose, which side's argument has more merit.  He proceeds, throughout the book, to make additional pronouncements.  Of cultural relativism, it takes only 13 pages for him to explain the concept, present arguments against it, and declare triumphantly, "This all adds up to a pretty thorough repudiation of the theory."  In other words, this and several other chapters amount to nothing more than persuasive texts arguing against the notion being discussed.  I have nothing against philosophers stridently stating their views; that's the entire point of philosophy.  It is simply not suitable, however, for an informative work intended as an introduction to ethics.  No writer is capable of fully and accurately explaining the intricate and nuanced positions of a branch of philosophical thought in 13 pages of text, let alone do justice to the critiques thereof.  Rachels, by refusing throughout this book to adopt a neutral point of view, has produced a text bereft of value 
 The guided meditations are OK, but this woman's voice grates on my nerves  -  she sounds like she's whining, making it impossible for me to actually listen to what she's saying.  I might like the book better.. 
 This book and the exam don't match up at all.  Though this book is written in a fairly superficial way the test itself asked very obtuse questions.  As such the test taker is left in a gap as to how to gain the knowledge to demonstrate mastery on the exam.  I still don't know one achieves this goal??? and this is coming from someone who has an mcse + I, CCNP, and CCDP and has worked extensivly in the website deployments with w2k for about a year.  So congratulations if you have passed the exam, and if you haven't I would wait till the texts and exams meet up sometime in the next couple months! 
 Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time.  The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there.  However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information.  So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a "history buff".  From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book.  The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful.  On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner.  Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book.  However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts 
 This book is simple to read, to the point, and is absolutely on the money in my opinion. An excellent book to give to new supervisors 
 I finished tufte last night... what a disaster, or perhaps sunk with high expectations.  I'm a huge fan of dr. tufte's very influential writing on information visualization - as far as I know he's done the best work in the field.  But this book - while simply physically and visually stunning - is a real disappointment.  In this work I read about 20% insight, 40% recycled material and preaching to what is probably the choir (this includes an overly repetitious chapter-long discussion of minard's lovely march to moscow graphic & his previously available power point piece), and 40% filler & drek. I don't find his comments on art, writing styles, baseball, and the like to be terribly compelling, and are certainly done better in many other works - and indeed, his thoughts on these ended up as being pretty grating and condescending, if not just wrong.  And that the book ends with several pages of photos (a few of really poor quality, I might add) his own outdoor artwork (which are of passable quality, but what the *bleep* does this have to do with evidence as defined at the front of the book?) only throws salt on the wounds.  This thing is maddeningly inconsistent.  I wish I could simply dismiss the work, but it's full of beauty and joy as well as the bad.  Sparklines are fun, but could be improved on.  Words + images combined inline, some great stuff there.  But while some of the really lovely things, like the translations of galileo, are wonderful and exciting to any science-loving person, they really are pretty pointless to the conversation at hand. He has gone straight down since his first major book - a 5+ star effort, the 2nd, 4.5-5 stars, 3rd, 3 stars, and this is about a 2 star one (2.5+ if you haven't read the others.)  If he'd stop believing his sycophants and stop taking himself so seriously in his quest to convince the reader that he's a high priest on a moral crusade it'd be wonderful.  He really does try to convince the reader that this topic is of high moral concern - not just sometimes, but in general.  I don't buy it.  And you shouldn't buy this if you haven't read his other works (although if you haven't I'll admit you'll probably like this, you just don't know any better ;-)).  Read the staggeringly good "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" or the wonderful "Envisioning Information". And if you must read this, soak up the good points, and try not to grind your teeth with the rest 
 Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding  the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea  and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative  sweetener.  I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting  stevia.  But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a  recurring problem 
 This stuff is so boring. I can't believe people still listen to this stuff. Seriously come on people! I laugh every time I see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere. Plus Busta has admitted to having "relationships" with men if you get what I mean. Makes you wonder about a lot of rappers.... 
 Ric still assumes you can get 10% on investments.  Right.  And your Enron retirement plan will keep you cozy until you're 99 
 It started with a great title, and an interesting subject. In fact, i already started reading it agreeing with the author. However, this book is terrible. It is unbelievably repetative, and the arguments are amazingly bad. If this book was redone using some solid thinking, it would be awesome. We won't change anyone's mind until you write arguments above a junior high level. I would recomment looking for other authors. I went into this book with high expectations, and was very disapointed. In fact, it pushed me more over to the other side as I read it, just because i was so taken aback by the garbage that was being put forth as argument and evidence. There just has to be a higher standard than this. If a student wrote it, i would give it a D. 
 Like almost everything else from Noontide press, this book is pro-Nazi propaganda, anti-semitic drivel. Unless you're a member of Aryan Nation or Combat 18, this and all their other volumes should be avoided like the intellectual plague that they are 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 Edward Hirsch has written a meticulous analysis of the art of poetry, imbued with an authentic love of the form. From page to page he dissects and interprets; his enthusiasm remains high throughout. Not just the poetry, but also the poets themselves are lavished with heroic praise, their craft transcending the mortal. Their words are golden strands of virtue more appropriately whispered into the ears of gods.  But, but...  For those of us uneducated in the art of poetry there is a much more basic level of understanding that has to be achieved first: Why no punctuation? Why do sentences break in mid-breath? How does one find the meter in a poem? How does one read poetry without the stops and starts from line to line? Perhaps we should have learned this in school, but we didn't, so we bought this book.  This is a good book, really, but it is not what its title suggests. It should rather be entitled "The Love of Poetry", or "Falling in Love With Poetry", or "Furthering Your Love of Poetry", or something else emotive. "How to Read a Poem" sounds mechanical, the basics, just what those uneducated among us get when we do a keyword search on how to read a poem.  Select another book in order to learn how to read a poem, then graduate to this one once you comprehend the basics. 
 Let me start off by saying that I enjoy the book "The Shining" and read it a few times when I was younger.  Stephen King is obviously an incredible author with a gift for capturing a mood with clear and concise writing.  He is not, however, brilliant at writing screenplays.  His dialogue is so bad sometimes that it makes it hard to tell if the actors (mostly the child who played Danny) were really that bad or if it was just the script.  Also, I realize that this was actually a mini-series and not a feature film, but King felt the need not only to include every detail from the book (including the laughable hedge animal scene) but even added more parts not included in the book.  In addition to this problem, there were countless times that Jack would have a character beaten and ready to kill only to stop and say "It's time to take your medicine" or "you little pup" as the person inevitably escaped.  These two factors served to drag the movie on for so long that all of the feeling of urgency is lost, leaving the climax pretty anti-climactic.  I know that many people will prefer "Stephen King's the Shining" to the original movie simply because it is more true to the book, but compare the new cheesy hedge animal attack to the old hedge maze chase.  Or the blood on the wall transforming from redrum to murder in the new vs. the spine-tingling scene with the mirror where the mother sees redrum backwards.  Or simply compare the acting jobs between the uber-creepy old danny and the cute and cuddly new danny.  I know it's not fair to compare so I'll leave you with this- if you want a warm and fuzzy fairy tale Shining, go with the new.  If you prefer horror, try Kubrick's version 
 They have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut.  My hair is very short and this is unusual.  If you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out.  I spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better.  I would have been better buying a cheap pair at Walmart, which I normally do 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 Do not buy this for the GMR1038-2 or 2CK radios.  It is not the right unit for that radio.  I have no idea how well it works for the correct radio, but it did seem comfortable and low profile, like it would fit well under hearing protection.  woops, duh, darn.  I need to return it for either an HS910 or S915, which I don't see on Amazon. I do not think Amazon should take advantage of dopes like me by listing this as "people who bought X also bought Y".  I now know that is a bunch of bandini 
 First book by Alastair Reynolds I truely disliked. Disjointed and confusing. I skimmed through it and abandoned it in a hotel room as not worth carrying home 
 the avengers are just another in a series of victims of so called "genius" writer/creators.  if marvel serves up any more of this drivel it won't have any of its fan base left.  its simple: heroes= goodguys, they win and live.  villains= bad guys, they lose and die.  got it marvel?! avoid this crap 
 I bought this belgiam waffle maker 30 days ago.  It worked fine for 30 days and then the iron stopped heating up.  I contacted Villaware and they suggested getting Amazon.com to replace the unit which they did.  Time will tell on the replacement 
 Gene Hackman plays a career army man who is duped into transporting a prisoner to the US as part of a complicated assassination scheme in this tired, contrived relic of Cold War paranoia.  High ranking military officials on both sides are in cahoots to derail disarmament talks and Hackman, along with ex-wife Joanna Cassidy, are the only ones who can stop them.  Stock secondary characters are on hand to provide a piece of needed information or pull our heroesEfat out of the fire and then die on schedule as required by the screenplay so that the viewer can feel the Sense of Danger and Urgency.  The twists and turns of the plot are uninvolving and the climax is thoroughly conventional.  The talented cast does what it can to elevate the proceedings 
 I bought this book based upon some of the other reviews that said it was great and they couldn't have been more wrong. I needed the book on short notice so it cost me $25 and it was absolutely useless. There is nothing useful in this book at all. I ended up just winging the toast because I didn't have time to look for another book 
 The author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book.  The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion 
 I have usually enjoyed this series since the first title was released. As time goes on, I find myself waiting longer to read these books. They just aren't a "must read" any more.  Like: The humor! No one does this aspect as well.       The mystery, when it is actually a mystery.       Her friends - what an amazing assortment of characters.    Dislike: The whining. Its more than time for Eve to face up to her past - or not. just do it one way or the other. Other people (in real life) with much less going for them (supportive spouse & friends, job, respect and so on) have managed to face thier pasts in a healthier way than Eve. I do tire of reading about the horrific abuse in every book. Isn't it time for Roarke to use his influence and find her parents? We all know the man she killed wasn't really her father, right? She has to be a much-missed child from good parents.         The sex. Perhaps some people read Robb for the sex scenes but they bore me. I find they bring the series down rather than elevating it. These scenes I skip and its easy to do since, once they start, they invariably take up the rest of the chapter. Why not leave these scenes to the heavy-breathing historical type stuff she writes?         Love Roarke but dislike that we have to always hear what a bad boy he was. This book kind of moved away from that. Kind of.   Overall, its just time for the main characters to grow up and stop sniveling. There are people out there in the world with ever so much less than either one of them have who managed to overcome. Why not make these characters like that?  Oh, and what is with the "stand for"? Someone is always standing for someone. Its written in such a way I just know that no one would ever really talk like that. And its said much too often. She has used that phrase in other books as well (& other series). Perhaps she does know people who speak like that, but I have yet to meet one. Sometimes her characters come across as almost comic when she places words in their mouths that just aren't thiers.  All that said, I honestly do enjoy Robb, but for the mystery and the humor and the relationships. The cop work is usually good, but its been missing. Basically, I could do without all the sex (some romance is lovely) and truly appreciate a good detective story written by a talented woman. 
 If you can ignore the dated assertions that the Earth is shaped like a top, you still have to swallow 1000+ pages of Fort's inane philosophical musings on subjects that have potential. Rather than explore in detail a specific time when, say, it rained fish, Fort is content to give the reader a list of all such events that occurred and use this as a springboard to prove (or prove-unprove as he would say) that there are magical lands in the sky 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 I was wondering why you have asked me to review this particular book, since you sent me notice that you had to cancel this order?   At first you said it was cancelled because I did not respond to say that a delay was OK.  I explained to you what had occured.  Then, you said you had to cancel it because the book was out of print.  I am not at all upset with you--you continue to provide such considerate customer service!  But, I guess I was really hoping that this book had turned up somehow, and that you had or would be sending it to me!  Oh please!  Oh please!  I would appreciate hearing from you about this.  Thank you,  Peggy  Wisema 
 What happened?  Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point.  Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?  Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks.  Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss 
 I bought this CD thinking it contained old swing songs remastered and mixed - something like Jive Bunny "The Album" is. Fun upbeat music you can actually swing dance to. Not so, this is full of remakes, not done as well as the originals and they are slow and very boring. Not a good buy if you like to dance or listen to Big Band Swing 
 Bought this book as a spinoff to a seminar hoping for some insight into a complex subject. The common cause made between ineffectual clergy of the late 18th century and American women was interesting, but then the author lost herself (and her theme) in her exhausting review of obscure, forgettable literature. The phrase "deadly dull" comes to mind.    The book is more notable for what it does not address than for what it does.   
 Worst product on the market! A huge disappointment. I was very careful to use as directed. The result? One big mess! The lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and I had no choice but to throw them away 
 The only reason this gets one star is because zero stars is not an option.  I will concede that the content is good, but the delivery is so bad that the tapes are almost useless.  My problem is that he simply speaks SO fast it is impossible to follow him.  Then, the breathing is too much.  He is talking throughout, and is completely out of time with the breathing.  Even if he was in time, the breathing is just not right.  In a few places I got the impression he was just providing filler to stretch it out to six tapes.  Your money is much better spent on any of Richard Sutphen's materials. This is garbage by comparison 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 I have yet to receive this book. Insofar as it was advertised as being available, why all the delay? I do hope my credit card has not been debited for this transaction as it is now one month and there is still no book. I will probably buy my books in a book store from here on.

 I purchased these slippers for my son as a Christmas present.  The stitching ripped through the suede after ond day of wear.  I am very disappointed 
 Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews.  I was almost in tears I was so bored.  It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie!  I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable.  Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible.  The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog.  When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable.  Boy were we wrong.  This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time 
 I don't consider myself to be a total idiot. I've read a little psychology, a lot of philosophy, quite a bit of mythology, and have a fair grasp of history. At the same time, I'm also open to what today we call "New Age" or "occult" even if I am always going to be a bit of a skeptic. None of that really helped here. Ever read a paragraph and realize that you didn't really get what you just read? This might happen if you're tired, or lose your focus for a minute. Then you go back and re-read it and it makes more sense. Well, The Portable Jung reads like that initial scenario for me from start to finish, no matter how focused I am. The thing is, when I read a summary of Jung's ideas from another writer, I understand exactly what is being said. The collective unconscious,anima/animus, the shadow...it makes sense. Then I read Jung's own writing and can't connect the sentences. My grandmother says it just must be "bad writing." I don't know. Maybe Jung sensed in his own time the hostility and ultimate rejection of his ideas by the scientific community and always wrote and spoke that way to avoid the ridicule that plainer speaking of such unorthodox subject matter would provoke. (Wow, multiply the awkwardness of that sentence by 10 and you'd think I was channeling the spirit of ol' Gustav). Ironically, Jung has pretty much been ditched by the psychological community and embraced by English majors, such as myself, who would receive the written equivalent of a scowl from our professors if we ever wrote with the pretentiousness and virtually alien syntax of this book. Anyway, I worked and worked at appreciating The Portable Jung, reading as carefully as possible. I really wanted to like it. But first I needed to understand what I was reading sentence by sentence. I never did (however, the reasoning, when the clouds occasionally parted, seems to be pretty much what you'd expect from anyone trying to justify what is essentially parapsychology. Check out the references to the 300-something "random" interpretations of a patient's dreams, which, ta-da, remarkably revolve around the idea of alchemy and an Asiatic symbol called a mandala). 2 stars, though, since I did start keep track of my dreams a bit more (however I have concluded that a recent dream involving rollerskating had more to a movie preview I saw the day before of "ATL" rather than the Wheel Of Life). 
 As I read this book, I got to thinking that it's too bad the author is married. Otherwise, I think I could marry her, because then I could say to her "Hey, you know all of the things you point out in this book that women do that drive men crazy? Yeah, well .. don't do any of those things!" And then I believe we could live happily ever after. In my honest opinion, I think this book should've been written for women to illustrate all the things that women *shouldn't* do. But instead, it is an instruction manual for us men explaining why women do the irritating things they do and why we should put up with them.  For example, let's say you're a guy on a business trip far away from home. When you get to your destination, you call your woman from the airport to let her know you're not dead. However, when you get to your hotel room, instead of calling to check in yet again, you decide to just crash because you're exhausted from the trip. So now your woman is sitting at home going nuts, wondering if you died on the way to the hotel, got abducted by aliens, or (worse yet) in your hotel room shagging another woman. So when you do call the next day to check in, you get an earful, with your woman telling you how thoughtless and selfish you are. The author points out that women don't do this because they're insecure and neurotic. Oh no, they do it because they love us!! So instead of advising women to relax and take a chill pill, men are instructed to appease the woman and *appreciate* this behavior.  And that's the basic tone of the book. The author points out all the stupid and annoying things that women do (and readily admits that these things are annoying) such as wanting their man to sit down with them and talk about absolutely nothing, and then points out how guys can alter their behavior to accomodate the type of behavior from women that we hate. And what is our reward for doing such things? More sex! That's right, if your woman is happy, you get more sex. As a guy, I have to wonder how much longer we're going to allow women to dangle sex in front of our face like it was some kind of Scooby snack in order to get us to do what they want.  Not that this book is a total waste .. the part about sex has some useful information, but  I'm sure there are better books out there devoted to this subject. Also, I would *not* recommend guys try and use these techniques in order to meet women. If you want to be a lapdog, it's probably best you wait until you get into a serious relationship, at which time the woman can tie the ball and chain around your ankle. If you do these things too early (like during the first 10 dates), you might (and probably will) come off as a supplicating fool.  Look, I'm not saying that one particular sex or the other should stop being who they are, I just think that it's a give & take kind of thing ... that each side should be willing to bend a little to satisfy the other's nature. But reading this book, I gather that many women think it is the man who is supposed to do all of the changing, and I consider that a little unfair.  PS - Just a bit of info for women. If you ever wonder why guys like to organize their thoughts before expressing them, listen up: There is a cardinal rule with men that if we say something to you and it can be interpreted in two different ways, and one of them is something that upsets you, we meant the other one. It has been my experience that women tend to take the worst meaning possible and store that in their memory bank like a cyborg, and then readily use that as ammunition in future arguments for years to come. For this reason, I like to get all my ducks in a row and make sure my logic is rock solid, lest I say something that doesn't quite come out quite the way I wanted it to, and then have that used against me for the rest of my life. "Hey, do you remember 20 years ago when you said I looked fat?" : 
 Ah, the mass prison breakout, a classic (overused) storyline.  A prison breakout encourages Captain America to form a team out of the heroes who arrive to stop it, reminded of how the Avengers originally came together.  Which in this incarnation is a semi-allstar lineup, in the current tradition of the Justice League, plus Spider-Woman and Luke Cage, who are entertaining characters in the series if odd choices (someone misses the 70's).   New Avengers has its ups and downs.  The artwork is quite pretty, though sometimes the colors are mergered into another too much and it's hard to tell what's going on.  The dialogue is frequently clever and humorous, though sometimes it seems like Spider-Man is trying too hard to be funny.  The overall story moves a bit slow (not much happens in six issues), the famous "decompression" style Bendis is associated with.  I suppose what I would consider the major flaw of the book is a common one with team books: characterization.  The only character who seemed to have a unique voice at all was Spider-Man, and that's primarily because he's the wiseass.  No other characters come across as themselves, just generic superheroes.    The overall story keeps your attention, details sometimes seem glossed over, but there are a lot of clever touches in story and dialogue that I enjoyed.  The actual forming of the team was a little eh, and I would have prefered some explanation given on why Pete getting his arm broken barely bothers him.  Some of the companion pieces of the New Avengers, such as the Spider-man stories with Cap, Iron Man, and Logan as supporting characters really capture the personalities of the characters that seems to be missing here, but indicate the possibilites of this new team.  
 Polk makes great speakers (LSi series), good speakers (RTi series), ok speakers (Monitor series), and mediocre speakers (R series).  But like most speaker manufacturers, their subs are horrible for the money.  Why?  Because they are betting that if you are already buying their speakers, you'll likely want to buy one of their subs too, especially if some slimey and/or ignorant salesperson tells you that you MUST "match" the sub and speakers.    Of course, those of us who know something about audio know that aside from a few rare exceptions (like Magnepan planar speakers which really require a super-quick musical subwoofer) there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH THING as "subwoofer-matching"---just get the best-sounding sub you can afford.  The best bang-for-your buck subs are made by the two dominant Internet-direct subwoofer specialists, Hsu and SVS.    This PSW10 is a prime example.  If you are in a small room and listening to jazz or rock music, it's not too bad.  Use it while blasting hip-hop, or watching a special-effects loaded movie like "Jurassic Park" or "Fellowship of the Ring" and you won't even know it's there---it simply does not go low enough nor loud enough (let's not even talk about if it's clean enough) to do the job.  The only worse mass-market subs I've ever heard would be the Sony and Yamaha subs; the Infinity subs are slightly better.  For this price range you can do much better looking at the 12" Dayton subwoofer from partsexpress dot com which goes for under a hundred fifty dollars shipped.  
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 ...I'm sure Air Supply is what I'll be listening to for eternity 
 Although this book had a lot of information to offer,I found it quite hard to find things under certain category's. For instance, I was trying to find a price for a plastic bank. First I checked banks,had many kinds listed,plastic,mechanical,etc but I couldn't find the one I had. I checked the index and found banks listed on about 20 different pages under different materials,eras,made by etc...way to confusing for us regular folk who just want to see if they've found a bargin or own something of great value.Unless you are an advid Antique Collector,I wouldn't recommend this book 
 An average book, the author repeats himself several times (for instance he mentions the guide to The Beast at least 5 times), and two chapters of the book are dedicated to HTML!! That's not precisely a guide to ARG. I found it quite a superficial book, not deepening enough in the capabilities of ARG 
 I am extremely dissapointed in this book.  Yes, some of the information was interesting.  However, there were no realistic suggestions for improvement.  As far as the homeless shelter in NYC(I didn't know mother theresa made NYC her stomping grounds), it may seem frivolous to put an elevator in a homeless shelter.  But hey guess what?!  Big surprise, some people that are handicapped are homeless too.  So I suppose they can just wait outside while a friend runs in and gets them a cup of soup and a roll.  It seems to me that Phillip K Howard is not familiar with people with disabilities or he would be singing an entirely different tune.  Physical and mental handicaps are a fact of life, and instead of putting them in institutions, hiding them away, or perhaps even enforcing mandatory sterilization(ok I may be exaggerating a bit there).  It is a fact of life, all "men" are created equal in the eyes of the law, and all of us are given the chance for the persuit of happiness.  If Phillip K Howard had his way, we would be without laws protecting the handicapped, mentally ill, and indigent members of society.  And yes, they need protection under the Law.  Because if they are Not protected, people take advantage of or ignore the rights, needs and wants of an important group in our society.  We all deserve the right to have a chance to contribute to society.  So lets not have another wheelchair bound person drag themselves up the steps of a courthouse so he could appear for a trial.  I guess Mr Howard missed that particular annecdote.  I give this book 0 stars, if I am required to give it any, then make them negative.  
 I used to love this game, but there are so many better games out there, plus this game is overated, with a not so good storyline, and nerdy weapons, it's just not good 
 prior to reading this book, i had already taken a more difficult , engineering-oriented Digital Signal Processing class (groundwork for Geophysics) so I had a good background it in.    this book attempts to dummy down DSP concepts for the laymen (or layscientists) but fails in doing so.  half of the ideas are well articulated, but the other-half are written poorly (confusingly or expounded insufficiently) or are illustrated poorly.   i imagined that if i had no background in dsp or engineering--the target of this book--i would have found it very frustrating.  since this is a textbook, most of the readers will have no choice in book selection, anyways, so tough luck : 
 I did not like most of the recepies that were in the book.  They were too exotic for me.  A couple of the desert recepies were ok and I did like the color pages that showed the food.  
 If you are looking for insight on how to build your business, this is not the right book.  It may be useful for young people or emerging artists.  Many of the tips are related to life skills.  The tips are presented simplisticly.  They are not particularly helpful for artists already in the marketplace.  
 Rhea Perlman, a short white woman, is going to teach basketball to her towering Black high school students. And even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she's White and sensitive and wants to be their "sistah." Gag me. This whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races. The director seems so sure he can sell a hip-hop basketball movie this bad to "those people" that he doesn't even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them. Avoid at all costs 
 This is the first of Benford's I've read, and I was disappointed. The idea of the intelligent black hole, while not totally novel, was fascinating, and supported by utterly convincing fact-based detail about ergospheres, magnetically controlled plasma, Alfven waves, and the Kuiper belt.  But when it moves beyond his area of expertise, astrophysics and the bureaucracy of big science, the story suddenly seems sophomoric.  This is basically an old-school 1940s pulp/Trek/Independence Day style plot.  I found quite a few implausibilities in the alien's history, the reaction of Earth's population to it, the politics, and the ability of scientists to outwit the US security apparatus.  The first 3/4 is very slow, although it gives a good picture of what it's like to be a high pressure astronomical researcher.  The characters seem cliche - the superior, cultured Brit, the spunky female astronaut.  The love story is nicely mature, but still slow and kind of wooden.    The biggest fallacy and irritant in the book was it's rah-rah anthropocentrism, with good ol' American homo sapiens managing to do what thousands of other civilizations couldn't - kick the alien's [...].  There were also a few disparaging remarks about Carl Sagan, whose alien contact novel 'Contact' is light years better than this one - in my opinion the best.  If you want to learn about plasmas and scientist's rivalries, read this book.  If you want a convincing alien contact story, read Sagan.         
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 Half of the books describes history of some herbs which I did not find useful, the other half it even does not demonstrate you the ability to help cure cancer.  It does not show you any scientific data from a recognized  company (e.g. FDA).  The title should be "Herbs Against What".   It was a waste of time this book 
 I have never played a game that crashed so often. Very frustrating. it was fun until it would crash the first time in a one hour session. But the second time in a one hour session is just Ridiculous. dont know if it is the programing or starforce but its frustrating. The game was fun for a while then became very repetitive  
 This sequel to 1939's far superior "Jesse James" misses much of the humor and stark imagery that made the first film such a (underrated)masterpiece. Fonda is good as Frank but the script gives him little to do and Lang's direction is likewise handsome but undistinguished. A minor addition in both the Lang canon and the Fonda Western canon 
 The photos in this cookbook are lovely, and the recipes are inventive. However, the cupcakes from the three recipes I have tried so far have turned out dry and crumbly. I don't think the cupcakes were overbaked -- it seems like there was something fundamentally wrong with the recipes. I would recommend this cookbook only to bakers with enough experience and knowledge to make the cupcakes moist 
 The author - not the subject.  Just a very strange book that requires a real will to finish 
 This book was nothing like its advertisement.  I thought it was going to be a new take on the sleeping beauty fable, but it wasn't.  It took the fabled character Beauty and made her a sexual slave at the mercy of a medival sex ring. All the surrounding kingdoms sent beautiful princes and princesses to this castle as a tribute.  This young royals were subjected to horrific tortures and were treated worse than livestock. The characters who led this sex ring claimed it made these spoilt royals better people and better rulers when they were returned.   As I read this book, I figured there had to be a deeper meaning behind the ridiculous and unbelievable toture scenes, mind games, and Anne Rice's strange obsession with spanking.  No matter how demoralized Beauty became, she never tried to fight back or escape.  Just cried.  Apparently, this was her becoming a good slave. The characters were boring.  Probably because it must be difficult to properly develop character growth when you are so obsessed with spanking...  I tried very hard to finish it hoping for a reason for such an awful and tiresome tale.  There was no deeper meaning behind such a horrible story.  All there was at the end....was a sequel.  Um....not a chance.  I'm glad I didnt pay 14 bucks for this book, I read it in a bookstore for free. I am sorry enough for that. 
 A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.  Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available 
 "My Chain" is the worst song I have heard in a few years ... Go get Nas "Hip Hop Is Dead" instead of this garbage. 
 Man this item is fantastic. I love wasting $80 on pointless furniture. Getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems.... Man I must be in heaven. Not only that but it breaks easily, does this thing have no limit? So I bought this great video center around a year ago.... And what happens it breaks. I had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap. It looks like you're in a baby kids room. Similar to those play centers in day cares or McDonalds. Man that is lame.... I just love having children decor in my house, and it has to be $80. If I were you.... I would just let my systems, TV, and CDs sit in some tubberware. Believe me it would be 50X safer! 
 While i was inspired by all of other castaneda books (i have not yet read second ring of power)  this one was my least favorite.  It did not have any of the great quotes of don Juan Matus or commical actions of Don Genaro, and it was not inspiring. it did have a few interesting parts here and there, but overall was kinda [crummy] compared to his other book 
 Since you can tell how I feel about this book based on the title of my review, I won't repeat everything that's been said by the other reviewers so far.  However, I will say that, as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely, I am SO NOT HAPPY that I spent close to $20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me.  I don't want to throw it away, but I certainly can't see where anybody would want to buy it if I re-sold it. This book was a total waste of money--if there were a 0-star rating, I'd give it that without hesitation 
 When you look at the title of this book--Planet of the Beast, you think maybe the author is referring to Jason? Nope rather a stupidly contrived planet nick-name for planet #666 how dumb is that? However being that this is a sci-fi Horror, I'm willing to just go with the flow and give the author Nancy Kilpatrick the benefit of the doubt. Planet of the Beast is a slow read, not totally intolerable like the last book, "the Experiment" by Pat Cadigan.  The first half of this book introduces 11 characters living at space station G7 including a meglomaniac doctor and his weasaly assistant which definatley had over tones of Dr Frankenstein and Igor all over it. Including their plan to "create" a new being by way of cloning. Total cheese.     After 200 pages of space regulations and botched interstellar protocol and characters pulling rank on each other our guy Jason finally shows up on board to wreak havoc.  Some of the scenes are pretty cool in typical Jason style, but again(which happens in a lot of these Jason X novels or the Friday the 13th novels) Jason takes a back seat to yet more character development and personal insight. I don't really need to know all that extraneous info on a character that gets disemboweled!     This book could have been any sci fi book, all you had to do was insert the word "alien" or "monster" into the spots that says "Jason X."  Technology on the space station is o.k. for a sci fi book that takes place in the 24th Century, some force fields, advanced nanotechnology, interesting space suits and laser weapons outfit the G7 space station/lab.  The Author almost gives you a walk through of the space station as the story progresses, almost like its a travelogue.      Oh yeah, whats this bunk with calling him "Jason X"? I thought he was just plain old Jason?  Jason "X" was just the number of the film, you know X=10.  The hokey camp fire stories being told by one of the characters pits jason against soldiers in louisiana swamp, and another has Jason back in the 1930's going after Dorothy and Toto. What was the author thinking? Fortunately the Jason and the Wizard of Oz scenerio is pre-empted to go to another scene and then rejoined as the character is finishing. Thank god!    Planet of the Beast has a better second half, but it was still painful to digest. I thought the action could have been a lot better, the urgency of the characters wasn't described good enough.  I also notice several typo's and misspelled words throughout the book.  Bottom Line......try to keep yourself awake reading this one 
 I have become greatly dissapointed McDonell's work in recent years. In the first couple of collections, Mutts was right on target, witty and fresh, but now it seems that Mutts has become preachy, and cloyingly sweet. Most of us already have helpless guilt from reading newspaper articles on vanishing tigers, do we really need it in a comic strip? Even the artwork seems lacking, as if McDonell was late for a deadline and did a rush job. The Mutts creator definitely needs new ideas 
 *Updated - See below*  Do not buy this machine, or any other Danby product for that matter, because their customer service is nonexistent.  I owned my Danby Portable dishwaser for about 6 months before my latch broke and the wash cycle therefore would not start. I live in Hartford, CT, and I called ALL of the service centers listed on Danby's website in CT and they either stopped working on Danby products (which I will address later), or they would not travel to Hartford, or they would not return my phone call.  After a week of waiting for a return call from the messages I left, I decided to call customer service and they actually gave me a service phone number that would come out to look at my machine and repair it.   After the repairman looked at the machine he told me that he needed to order a part for it. A week later I called the service center and they stated that the part that I needed was on backorder for 4 weeks.   I called Danby customer service and stated that it was unacceptable that I should have to wait 4 more weeks for my dishwasher to be available for use. They told me that it was not their responsibility and to return it to the place that I bought it. I called the retailer and they stated that they had never  heard that before and that they would call Danby and verify this statement. I called the reteiler a week later and they said that they had left several messages and Danby never returned one call!!!  After this I relunctantly realized that I would have to wait until the part came in. A full 6 weeks after the initial service visit I called the service provider. they stated that they have not receieved the part yet and that they severed their relationship with Danby because of the extremely poor customer service, parts backordered, etc..... but they would honor their commitment to me whenever the part came in.  The convenience of this portable dishwasher is dwarfed by the incompetence of Danby's customer support. I will never purchase another Danby product again, nor will I ever recommend one to anyone else. I will however, make it a point, that if someone ever mentions the Danby name to me again, to ensure that they walk away from the conversation feeling exactly the same way about Danby that I currently do.  **UPDATE**  Ok, after I finally got so fed up that I called Danby again. And, to my surprise the woman that took my call actuallly listened to my story and told me that she was sorry and that she would get a replacement machine to me right away. The machine came in 3 business days and they took away the broken one.  The whole "experience" that I went through with this machine has been less than memorable. Although the machine works very well and the fact that it was eventually replaced still does not overcome the grief that I was put through by Danby's customer service. The fact that there was one "good apple" in a basket of rotten ones does not change my mind that this machine and all Danby poroducts should be avoided due to lack of customer service 
 I bought this book hoping it would give me basic information on color mixing, brush technique and composition.  It did not.  The book has some beautiful examples of the author's art but gives very little information as to how he got there.  It is not a step-by-step instruction book.  Mr. Greer does not tell how to handle the acrylic medium as for as how to mix and apply the paint to get various results.  If you are a beginning landscape painter looking for basic instruction in acrylic painting techniques, buy another book.  If you have the basics down pretty well then this book may be for you.  The author is a good landscape painter but not the greatest teacher 
 Dan Rather writes excellent stories, including those which are completely fabricated.  Take the new "memo" which Rather seemed to have come across.  Not only was the memo found to be false, but Rather is a suspect for writing it.  Rather should resign and at least keep his dignity, and rid the american public of at least one liberal news anchor 
 This book is only a shadow of what Bukowski can do. I was very dissapointed with his wife being so hell bent on releasing his unpublished work. These poems are all ones that he would have never released had he  been alive. They have no charm and show nothing of his talent. His wife I  guess thought they were good enough to be released. I beg to differ. If you  want a good collection of his poems from the last years of his life check  out Betting on the muse which is an amazing book 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Sir, not only have I knowledge of Scotland, I am Scottish, have lived there for 4 decades and I have a great deal of insight into the machinations of societies within the conurbations that create the cities of Scotland. These are not kernals of truth in my review - but factually accurate statements reflecting a book. Go check the pages yourself and you will see that no where have I made this up! I challenge to tell us all, have you even BEEN to Scotland yourself? If indeed you knew Scotsmen, you would have a full and complete undertanding of my review!! Apparantly you do not!! And therefore you are in no position to discuss the factual relevence of my review 
 I belive this book is just a little more them a book for dummies. I still don't think I picked the right book for me. I still feel like I am in the dark. 
 I was hoping to wear this for my daughter's Easter Christening. Well, no dice. It's extremely cheap (very light material, frayed at the edges, and the embellishments seem just ironed on), big and boxy, and the lining leaves little to the imagination. Sending it back 
 JOSEPH SMITH WAS A FALSE PROPHET! Read the Bible about false prophets, then read what informed critics have to say about Joseph Smith. Remember, DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID!! 
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop 
 I bought this book thinking it will help me in my research on the myths of the Shaolin temple's involvement with MA. This is a edited version of a book that was published in China in c.a. 1918 and it is one of the sources of the myths about CMA. Smith's book has to little, to called it a "definite" guide is misleading 
 This 1958 film of Graham Greene's novel is interesting today mostly as an historical artifact. It is not a particularly outstanding example of the art of cinema, just a dated melodrama in which the location exteriors in Saigon lead to interior dialogue scenes that are stagy and leaden and obviously take place on unconvincing studio sets. It is admittedly fascinating to see some of the exact same Saigon locations that were used in the 2002 film, and Michael Redgrave does bring a weight and soul to the role of Fowler.  Sadly, however, the film brutalizes his character. Where Greene's novel was about a world-weary Brit, confronted with a blindly idealistic American willing to sacrifice innocent lives in the name of his goals, the film inverts everything. Pyle is a virtual saint and Fowler merely the gullible old man who plays a part in Pyle's downfall not out of a desire to protect the innocent, but simply to rid himself of a romantic rival. It is not difficult to see why Graham Greene was incensed by the film and disowned it.  Fascinatingly, director/screenwriter Joe Mankiewicz manages to make this total change largely by the addition of one scene at the end. His film basically follows Greene's novel, up until [SPOILER WARNING!] an atrocious final scene in which we learn that Fowler has been hoodwinked all along by the Communists, and has destroyed a noble American who was genuinely bringing freedom and hope to Indochina. A prescient warning about America's doomed involvement in Vietnam becomes a piece of jingoistic propaganda to support the war.  The 2002 film, in comparison, is amazingly faithful to the novel. I don't always hold that as the measure of a film's success, but with a master storyteller like Greene, why mess with perfection. Do not choose this film if you want accomplished filmmaking, or an accurate interpretation of Graham Greene's intentions, for that pick up Phillip Noyce's 2002 film. Watch this only afterwards, to see how a few small changes can undermine an entire narrative. 
 If what the author says is true, I despair of ever really learning about annuities.  He claims that, as of the writing of this book, there have been four books on annuities, and he's written three of them.  Ugh.  First, the positive, because there's almost always something positive.  The green ink they used for the print is very easy on the eyes.  And I did manage to learn a little about the very confusing world of annuities.  But that's about it for the positive.  The book was not very clearly written or organized.  Some sections didn't seem to pertain to the chapter title.  The examples were mostly un-helpful.  So to make up for his lack of clarity, the author resorted to repetition, which only made matters worse.  The other thing that bothered me was how gung-ho the author was about annuities.  I almost felt like I was reading a sales pitch rather than an educational book.  Maybe annuities really are so confusing that no one can make them clear.  If that's the case, then maybe this author shouldn't have even bothered.  (He probably shouldn't have bothered regardless, because he's hopeless as a writer.)  You might get something from this book, but I'd advise against actually buying it 
 EDIT: I guess this deserves two stars rather than one; after all you can't get this stuff anywhere else.  I was feeling a bit shirty when I gave it one star.  Now, on with the review! - - -  First of all let it be known that the so-called "notebooks" of the title are a fiction. The title implies that during the making of his greatest films Sir Alfred sat down, licked the end of his pencil, and committed to paper all his magic in black and white for the indy filmmakers of posterity to read and emulate.   Well, sadly, there are no long lost secret "notebooks". The creative genius of Hitchcock, much like the plans in The 39 Steps, resided in that little man's head.   What we have instead is distressingly prosaic, and not very educational at all. We get memos, telegrams, more memos, lengthy side by side script draft comparisons, transcripts of conversations, still more memos, and a few storyboards that can be found elsewhere.   And if, upon hearing the name Hitchcock, you think of titles like Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, and North by Northwest, then prepare to be disappointed. They aren't discussed. Instead we're referred to the author's other books for the first two films and the Criterion laserdisks for the rest. (Laserdisks! Do they even make those anymore? Thanks for nothing, guys.)   We do get a gobsmackingly large amount of stuff about Marnie, though.   But wait, there's more:   We get a thrilling exchange of telegrams discussing whether or not Suspicion is a boring title for a film. (Hitch says yes, his producer says no, then Hitch says yes again, and his producer repeats no. How's that for a look into the mind of a genius?)   We get lengthy memos from people like Hume Cronyn talking about how scene 423 of a second draft of a script that we never have seen nor never will see needs to be revised in some unspecified way.   We learn that the character development in The Birds was a little below par. There's a series of four or five lengthy letters, all saying the same thing, and capped off with this brilliant editorial comment from our learned author: "Of course, the consistent complaint here is the weakness in the character development, something that was never worked out." Thanks, Professor.   We get fuzzy reproductions of the blueprints for the bookshop in Vertigo, should you want to build one of your own.   We get twenty pages of reproduced letters in Hitchcock's illegible handwriting discussing whether or not 3-D is a good idea. At least that's all I could make out.   We get the first draft treatment of Shadow of a Doubt in Thornton Wilder's handwriting. Alas, it too is illegible.   We get pages and pages and pages and pages of material about Marnie. It seems that half the damn book is about Marnie.   We get not one, not two, but three letters from some guy named Otis Guernsey telling Hitch he's welcome to use his germ of an idea for North By Northwest.   We get not just the film-related parts of letters, but the whole blessed thing: paragraph after paragraph of "How's Alma?" and "Drop by the next time you're in town" and letterheads for the Herald Tribune, all taking up valuable space.   We read a memo asking that the dialogue for The Birds needs to be punched up "on pages 6-10, 27-29, 37, 40, 48, 49, 50, 53, 54, 65, 74, 132, 188, and 194."  And so on. Basically, the book seems to have been assembled by dipping at random into Hitchcock's old file cabinets, running every other scrap of paper through a scanner, then presenting the whole pile sans comment. There's a definite rummage sale vibe about the whole thing - the very occasional gem amid lots and lots and LOTS of hooey.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, this one's for the completist.  Anyone who would like to get an insight into the creative thought processes of Hitchcock would be best served by the Truffaut interview book.   As for the rest of you, well, I hope you liked Marnie 
 While Pavement has merit, has anybody noticed that their singer can't sing.  He can't carry a tune.  His voice constantly breaks.  Listen to him sing REM's Camera and then compare to Michael Stipe's singing on the original. Like all albums on Amazon, the reviews for this album are consistently raves, as only huge fans typically take the time to write reviews. 
 I knew something was amiss after ripping this to mp3 realizing it sounded EVEN WORSE, sounding way more degraded than the quality loss you'd expect from cd to mp3 transfer. If the decision to release these songs with poor sound quality was DELIBERATE then she's doubly failed; there is no added "warmth" or "ambience". This is a tragedy, because Orton has talent but it doesn't come through as I'd hoped on this album. I yawned several times during playback, it just isn't very good. These cuts would work better as throwaway, "alternate takes" or "rarities" - but as a bona fide career release? What she should have done is dump this production set and handed it over to William Orbit, who not only would have made these tracks infinitely more listenable, but you would actually HEAR them with proper EQ and mastering 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 Giving this so-called Bible a one is too high.  I love Scripture and have studied the Bible for years, but whenever someone quotes from this version, for me it is like listening to nails scratching a chalkboard.  It is THAT offensive.    The Message is frequently called a "translation" when in actuality it is a paraphrase with one man's interpretation as commentary.  I find that it actually obscures the plain and simple meaning of Scripture, and deliberately puts forth non-Biblical gobbledy-gook, while having the nerve and audacity to be referred to as "God's Word."  Distorting God's Word is a very serious matter, which The Message does all too frequently.  I have found that The Message frequently takes a Bible verse and makes it unrecognizable in form and in content from a good translation.       There are definitely places in The Message that come straight out of New Age dogma and verbiage, one notable example is in The Lord's Prayer.  This is extremely disturbing to me.    Just as no student of Scripture would ever dream of using The Living Bible for study, no student of Scripture should ever consider using this mess as representational of God's Word.  It isn't.  Please don't insult me with stuff like "kindergarten finger-painting" for Hebrews 6:1, or "blessed are they who, when they get to the end of their rope hang on" for a beatitude.  The Bible does NOT say or convey that meaning.             
 Apart from the section on Shannon, who is not covered well by others, I found very little to recommend this book. Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts. I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe, or its contents. Particularly as we still have no idea what 96% of the universe is made of (dark matter)!!! In essence, saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense...a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero. 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 I bought this crock pot because it didn't look like a traditional country style crock pot. Unfortunately the handle broke off with the slightest bump. You can't even buy a new liner on their parts web site. This thing is a flimsy piece of crap. 
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly.  I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old. 
 What made me buy the book was the cover for the sarong. I thought WOW, I already had ideas. Then when I received the book, went through the pics, [which they give closeups on the stitches] I was thinking, [Ive been had] The poncho they have only 1 though I dont like the pattern it gave me ideas and the yarn Richesse et Soie impossible to get,which I want for the high content of cashmere, from K1C2, and the silk ribbon form Artemis, you can't even find I dont think they do any more. I was truly disapppointed and have entertained the idea of sending the book back. There is more accessories [wristband, small pouch bag, alot of edging] than there are clothing. I was hoping for sweaters, better designs on hats/scarves. Save your money! : 
 Received changer a few weeks ago & anxiously started loading my store bought DVDs. Followed the directions, but found that it would not capture the info or picture from the discs. Entered about 40 manually with a computer keyboard & all seemed OK. Started playing differant discs & found sub titles on all movies. Tried eliminating through disc set up & the changer with no avail. Called Sony support & after an hour of tinkering, they said the software was defective & it should be returned. Sony informed me that if the changer was without power for half an hour, that ALL info would be lost & have to be reentered! Any idea how long it would take to enter info for 400 discs manually? They suggested a UPS for back up power. What a great solution for a $300 SONY product. Once thet get it right & have permanent memory without band aids, it may be a typical Sony product. The discs fit very loosely in the carousel, so that if you want to relocate the unit...or maybe think about using it in a motor home, the discs can fall out very easily. Am returning to Amazon & they inform me that it will no longer be available from them, but perhaps other vendors 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 I can see the comparisons I read to Syd Barrett's style, but I found this album sort of monotonous.  It has an appeal to it, but not enough where I would buy the album.  On another note, I was reading the song-by-song 'review' given by another user here where they basically gave the same rating to every song and said almost the same things about every song.  Write a review that's useful!  If you're going to review each song, and you're going to give each song an A then don't EVEN BOTHER WITH IT!  
 At a risk of offending Joseph Campbell cultists and fantatics, please know that I am both an admirer of Joseph Campbell and James Joyce. It was through Campbell's praise of Joyce's work, that help muster the discipline it takes to read Joyce. I'll give credit where credits due--thanks Joe!  Now here's my beef. I suspect that it's takes a man with a healthy ego and a sense of academic competitiveness to want to incorporate Joyce's work into a grand blanket scheme, such as Joseph Campbell did with many of Joyce's work. I believe Ulysses is appropriate enough to enter into a conversation of mythology, but Finnegans Wake? No, I am not buying it.  So what is this Skeleton's Key anyway? Basically it's a fleshed out version of the Outline of Chapter Contents already provided in the Penguin edition of FW, which in truth, is helpful as a "key". Seamus Deane offers an introduction that is as helpful (and unhelpful) as Campbell's. So over the 70-odd years since Finnegans Wake first appeared and not much is known about it--perhaps Joyce intended just that--an enigmatic mystery. Why try to dismantle a good thing 
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS. 
 Although I did not get a chance to read the book yet, but I heard the author present her works at the C-Span2 Book Review channel over the weekend. From her talks, the book sounded a lot like the recollection of the times of the great minds put together at Los Alamos, and her recollection about Feynmann's adventures sounded to come out of "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynmann"..where he recounted his safe-cracking days, among other jests he used to pull to entertain himself in the middle of nowhere.  But what really hit the wrong nerve, was her recollection of history, where she discounted the severity of the Normandy Beach VS the clashes in the Pacific Ocean with the Japanese, and then she went ahead and justified the use of A-bombs on Japan.  Although the clashes in the Pacific must have been rough..but at the sametime, US had the upper hand and the priveliege of breaking the encrypted traffic of the Japanese, and they easily countered them at their next move in the Naval fights.  Perhaps in describing the above, the author has easily forgotten all the efforts US diplomats over the last 50 years have put forward in writing and verbose to condemn and apologize the pains brought to the Japanese, by the usage of the A-bombs.    I really question the intent of the author by putting forth such irresponsible views, amidst the hostility the world is living in today. 
 This pirate chest is a total rip off.  The chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal.  When I ordered it as a gift for someone, they sent me someone else's order....then refused to let me return my item for a refund when I finally received it.  The company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all.  
 This book starts out with the affectation of being somehow applicable to "modern man." The author assumes modern men are "broken" and therefore must somehow be "fixed," and he offers his advice on how to go about being "A Real Man." Therefore this book will appeal chiefly to boys and men who feel inadequate as males and men; the same men who buy Hummers and/or guns and/or beat women and abuse children to compensate for their wan manhood (real or perceived).  The author portrays modern man as the victim to changing male roles. While this is true for some boys and men, it is by no means a universal trait. Any man who follows the dictates of his conscience and sense of honor and valor will know intrinsically what his role in life is; he will also find this book insulting and absurd.  Mentoring a boy and young man is a good thing; however, a young man must know when to slay his father and become a man himself. The danger of mentoring is that of the "alpha male" mentality taking over and running a boy's or young man's life to his detriment: when that occurs, cultist mentality takes over. (A good, and frightening, example of this is Robert Bly himself.) Taken too far, this mentality leads to horrors such as the People's Temple (Jim Jones and his mass murder-suicide), Heaven's Gate, Scientology, and a numberless other dangerous Follow-The-Leader mind-sets.  For those boys and men who feel they need such advice, a far superior book is "Fire in the Belly" by Sam Keen. It does not have the foreboding sense of victimization that "Iron John" does and it is far better thought-out as well as written 
 The author's method of "revealing...deeper organizational characteristics" is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes, assign them meaningless names like "4-17", and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven 
 I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock. The layout is irritating, poorly designed, and does not provide sufficient features. To make things worse, this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to CD. The one-star rating was too generous. 
 This is recycled trash.  This is old stuff they recorded on homemade equipment and slapped onto cassette tapes.  It has no place in the real music industry.  If they're gonna sell such poor material, they should drop the price ... because production this sloppy isn't worth [the money] 
 It is writen in a very "fancy" way. it is difficult to read. And I did not found it useful. 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 The whole idea of checking this book out from the library began when I realized that this story I was writing had a pretty similar plot as the story: a bunch of kids with these talents get called up to go to a special school, where they have their own rooms.  	Since I had taken some ideas (or as I call it, ripped off) from this series of books (or maybe it was from Harry Potter...?), I went to see the next installment in the series for some more ideas, hoping that this book would be better than it's previous counterparts.  	I was wrong.  	From what I had read in its Amazon.com description a long time ago, I thought it would be a bit interesting. The story concerns Charlie Brown, a person with a strange talent for hearing voices from pictures. After finding out his talent in the first book, he gets sent to Bloor's Academy, where many of his classmates have strange talents like him, such as being able to call up storms or having the ability of hypnotism.  	In this book, one of Charlie's friends, who is an orphan and lives at the academy, finally gets adopted by the D'Greys. But it is revealed that they are a child-hating couple, who end up forcing the orphan to sign an oath for obedience. They then end up locking him up behind a force field in an odd place called The Passing House.  	It sounds pretty suspenseful, right?  	But the truth is, the actual story isn't. Not only is the character development lacking, with the characters having no personality, everything gets solved within three pages of the events. Yes, I am sort of exaggerating, but the point I'm trying to make is that there are really no important conflicts, because they just all get solved without much difficulty.  	Another thing that I highly dislike about this story (plus the rest of the series) is that everybody is either good, bad, or good, but being controlled of the bad. Maybe it's just that I've been watching too much anime, where you can actually sympathize with the villains, to various extents. And the fact that none of the villains really have back-stories doesn't help much either.    	I suggest to you not to waste your time on the book, and instead read something else instead, which I have no suggestions for 
 This book was just a major disappointment. The subject is superb, perhaps the true golden age of baseball, but Roger Kahn ruined it with his windy political opinons. Mr. Kahn seems almost confrontational with his political views, and seems unable to present any baseball history without them. I finally stopped reading it about a fifth of the way through and am very sorry I bought it. Read "Dynasty" and "Bums" by Peter Golenbock for real history. Don't waste your money on this stinker 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 I really don't care much for Hogarth's style or drawing at all. This book was not worth the money I spent on it 
 war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
 I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn't straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn't work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn't have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON'T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off.. 
 I recently rented this movie, having never seen it before.  I'm wondering what all the kudo's were for.  Denuve was pretty and had a boyfriend who was interested in her.  Why did she lock herself in that ratty apartment?  Did she have a history of mental illness?  If she didn't like being alone why didn't she go with her sister or visit her parents for the weekend.  We're never told.  I was confused and bored.  What a let down 
 From the cover hype, I expected a complete turnkey program for installing and learning Linux. I was disappointed.  First, the book-provided CD would not boot, and there were no directions in the book on how to change one's BIOS to allow the CD to boot. (I learned from a friend how to do it.)  Second, the software provided to allow one to have a dual boot (Windows and Linux systems existing separately on one hard drive) is incompatable with Windows 2000 and XP, for it is confused by NTFS files.  So now I've got a useless book, unless I go out and plunk down 50-70 bucks for commercially available partitioning software OR install a companion hard drive reserved solely for Linux.  The cover should warn the inexperienced (dummy) user of these sorts of things 
 I am taking Calc II and am using this book. This book is horrible! I missed a lecture and when I tried doing the homework I got stuck. There are no example like the examples. I am here on this site to buy companion book so that I can do better on my homework. I wish they would stop using this book at university level courses. 
 The Roman World is an overview of Roman art and history (alot to cover in  one book). Without a solid background in Roman history it is very hard to  keep up with this book. Lots of gaps that a scholar might be able to fill  in but I had a very difficult time piecing everything together. Not for the  casual reader 
 I would like to second the comments of Jacques P. Talbot.  I bought this book expecting an atlas, that is a book of maps.  There are some maps in this book, but they are small and cluttered and I don't really find them useful.  The book is mostly pictures and text.  It reminds me of that Time-Life series, that is aimed at young people, although this book is not as good as any in that series.  The publishers must have changed their mind about what they wanted to do with this book.  They should not have put the word "Atlas" on this confused mess.  It might be OK as an introduction for people about 14-16 years old, but if you want an atlas with useful maps in it, don't buy this 
 This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's "Evil Empire".  But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel "They Shoot Horses Don't They", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before "Play It"'s publication.  A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend 
 As a new Skype user, I wanted to have a headset to talk and listen at the same time, however I didn't want one of those bulky headsets that go over both ears.  I looked at this product, which looked great!  I love the look of it, and how it seems it will fit right over the ear snuggly.  It also has reviews claiming it is the greatest thing ever.  I thought    I found the perfect lil headset, and I mentioned it to a friend who was also new to Skype and ordered one for each of us.  Well, it came and like a kid in a candy shop I went at it.  The ear piece doesnt fit nicely, it was very klunky and uncomfertable - unlike those sony over-the-ears and some bluetooth headsets.  I tried looking past that, and connected the cables to my computer.  As I had iTunes playing some music, I right away heard the sound which was OK I suppose for a cheap headset, but not as good as basic earbuds...  Then I made some test calls, and no one could hear me unless I WAS YELLING.  I do not like to YELL everytime I am speaking to someone, and this piece of trash is being returned ASAP.  Bottom line is, do NOT buy this.  Either go for a headset that goes over both ears with a proper mic OR if you dont mind your calls coming off your computers speakers, just buy a mic.  I am ordering a Logitech USB Microphone from Amazon, and I will review that seperately after it arrives 
 I was truly disappointed with this book.  It is not so much a comparative synopsis of the feminine in the various world religions, but more of a lengthy, personal account of excuses for the author's sexuality.  It sounds as if he is defending himself throughout the whole book, rather than just being happy within himself and his relationship.  He uses his knowledge of relgions of the world to try and show how his relationship is ok.  I did not even resell this book; I put it in the trash to get one less out of the world.  What a shame that the book couldn't focus on the subject to which it professes 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 Don't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine at the newstand.  Trust me... there will be no worthwhile patterns (I mean... just look at what they choose to grace their cover!!!)   I have stopped hoping for even a half-way decent pattern to come along during the two years or so.  I have seen litteraly only ONE knittable pattern in the last three years (December 2004 I believe it was... a lace cardigan with beaded trim).  Even the articles are pointless.  Save your time and money and get a subscription to Interweave Knits or Vogue Knitting.  Or opt for a new magazine (not available at all newstands in the US) called Simply Knitting, which is imported from the UK.  It amazes me that this magazine is even still in production with how horible it is!! 
 Lee Server's biography of Robert Mitchum was a brilliant page-turning narrative of a fascinating, unique, and enigmatic movie icon. This book on Ava Gardner, however, is a disappointment, a poor choice of subject, and an ultimately tiresome account of a woman who had all the breaks and all the luck in the world and did nothing with them. It's a tiresome chronicle of her drinking and sexual excesses from which the reader learns little about life. It's really a sad, depressing portrait of a vapid actress who lived off her iconic beauty like a parasite. 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 This book is clearly partisan without any objectivity whatsoever.  All attempts at actual journalistic integrity totally failed 
 I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 High class porn!! No, really has he every seen a woman that you can use as a floatation device?? 
 I admit I'm not a fan of knitting odd objects just for the sake of knitting, but even so, I found this book surprisingly uninspiring.  The colors range from white to beige, with a little cream and brown thrown in for variety, which some might find soothing but seemed just dull to me.  As for the patterns, most knitters who are not total beginners don't need a pattern to do a square stockinette pillow or, for pete's sake, a coaster.  The items that do need patterns are not things most people knit and for good reason - who needs to spend hours on lampshade covers, vase cozys, or shoe bags? Chair cushions, sure - except these had big buttons on them - so NOT comfortable.  Last but not least, each and every pattern calls for the author's own brand of yarn.  I'm not thinking that this book is going to sell much of it for her 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 We got this play tent as a gift.  It was so hard to put this tent up.  I couldn't do it by myself.  I had to wait for my Husband and we still had problems. The poles that hold up the tent are so long that they are so hard to get into the tent corners- that is what holds the tent up.  The kids did love the tent after we got it up though. They played for hours in it.  The first time we took it down- one of poles snapped in half.  So, now we are returning it 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend. 
 This and part 1 is merely repackaging of the 1st hard-bound book [Eye of the World].  The advertisment reads as if it is a prequel.  Wrong.  The publisher just figured another way to make a few more dollars.  The Eye of the World and all of the remaining books of "The Wheel of Time" are outstanding.  They didn't need / require this treatment 
 My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas, until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine.  It literally would not work anymore.  I tried everything.  Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed.... 
 My daughter loves her doll but, the diapers are horrible. I used a coupon and bought a package of pampers size N.  They fit perfect and they don't lea 
 I bought this expecting to get 101 generic rock licks that I could use while improvising, but that's not what this book is.  It's just a variety of very recignizeable bits and pieces of various songs, some rhythm parts, some solo parts.  I would only recommend this if you're interested in learning three or four bars of a Nirvana song, two or three bars of a Pink Floyd song, etc.  Like, "Impress your friends by knowing the first two bars of Lithium by Nirvana".  You may as well just buy the songbooks for your favorite albums and get the whole songs - it's not like there's any analysis of anything in here.  I can't see any purpose in this book existing except maybe if you're thinking of buying a Fender Cyber-Twin amp, this is a great demonstration of all the sounds that it can produce 
 I bought this book for my Numerical Analysis class.  It proves theorems very un-rigorously.  I've only seen the first 3 chapters so far, but a frequent phrase that comes up is "and by the results that we will show in Chapter 6, (statement) is true" 
 I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.    Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel.  The sprocket was badly bent.  I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel.  By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.    By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike.  I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 This comeback was a big letdown.  I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like "the Hurting" or "Songs from the Big Chair"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).    This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality.  "Everybody Loves a Happy Ending" is like the song "Sowing the Seeds of Love", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.    It wasn't a happy ending 
   I got this book from the library, after having taken out, and IMMENSELY enjoyed other books with similar themes by Indian, and/or Indian-American authors, like Kavita Daswani, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Amulya Malladi.      I might have enjoyed this book, and I could have thought it was a good book, if only the author, and the publishers had considered the print and style when printing the books.      What I am referring to, is that in this book, EVERY SINGLE new paragraph is preceded by a long hyphen (dash) which was EXTREMELY distracting, and made it VERY difficult for me to get through what may or may not have been a very good book.      The hyphen (dash) that I am speaking of is this, for example:      - She said, "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda". Then she went out to blah blah blah.      - He said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then he went out to blah blah blah.       - They said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then they went out to blah blah blah.         Because of this distracting form of typing, I was barely able to get past the first dozen or so pages.       It sounded like a very interesting book, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the constant hyphens. I'm sure its probably even harder for those with dyslexia, and other reading impairments as well as poor eyesight.      Maybe in the future, the author and publisher could think of this and maybe print the books just like other normal, regular books.    Then maybe I'd try reading it again. 
 Boring. I was attracted to this book because I thought it would describe the British imperial experience in Burma. Instead about 95% of the book is about the author. That would have been nice if he actually did something exciting but he doesn't. I finished the book but felt it was a waste of time 
 Somebody gave me this book, since I'm an amateur tracker; I doubt I'd have bought it if I read the reviews.  Parts of it were truly delightful, I admit, but I got a stomach-ache everytime I read some sort of pseudo-science or bastardization of actual science.  When factual claims are made that contradict what we know is true (I won't repeat the other reviewers' comments), or are made without evidence or reliable references, I can't trust anything else the author says.  It's a shame, because, for example I suspect the relation between foot shape and being "down to earth" is bunk (in lieu of carefully controlled studies to verify this), there *has* been a recent study showing a correlation between index/ring finger length ratio and the subject's sexual orientation or athletic ability. But, as with most pseudo-science, such actual science is disregarded in favor of wishful thinking 
 This Movie takes a big flaming tird on the MK series I mean How could Ed Boon let them do this. This Movie suck's dont ever watch it. It has Power ranger fighting and the cast stinks. The First one is the best 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Very disappointing, especially after the rave reviews on the back cover. The book is little more than a vehicle for Ballard's much aired views on suburban alienation. These views are done to death in this book. The dialogue is absurd, the plot is risible, the characters cardboard and the prose style is tired. I don't recommend it 
 I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.  
 If you're an armchair general who never served in the military and who believes that professors know more about war than soldiers, this is the book for you.  If you love dreary writing, buy two copies.  If tendentious history is your thing, buy three.  This is campus arrogance with little sense of the complexity, confusion and danger of battle.  But if you're just aching to believe that generals are all dummies, and that anybody with a doctorate in international relations could run our wars better than the men and women who sweat, bleed and die for our country, this is the perfect book for you.  Good trees died for this 
 At least, that seems to be the consensus among the people I know who really enjoy the paranormals. I'm surprised Roc billed  it as a fantasy.  To me, "Claimed by Shadow" does not stand up to Chance's first novel.   Success is hard to follow.  The singer Joni Mitchell once said, "No one ever told Van Gogh to paint Starry Night again," but that's not necessarily true.  When an audience comes to expect a certain style from an artist, they're disappointed when the creator doesn't deliver.    In that vein of thought, a second novel should be very much like the first.  Wooddavis' review stating that the novels are running in place is spot on thematically.  Both novels have the same plotline with some variation.   The problem is, in my opinion, the second novel was not quite up to the standard of the first.  Most writing instructors and editors will advise newbie writers not to use flash-forwards and flash-backs at the beginnings of their careers.  While these devices are very useful and evocative, they can often lose the reader.  While Cassie's time-shift capability was an interesting new development, Chance did not handle these episodes with the same finesse that author C. E. Murphy uses in her Walker Papers series when Joanne goes vision-questing.  The time-shifting skill is definitely an interesting talent in conjunction with clairovoyance.  Aside from the paradoxes Cassie can create, she can also effect her own predictions--nulling and creating new ones as need arises.  I'm not sure Chance has sufficiently prepared her girl with the strength and decisiveness to be that dangerous an opponent.   Cassie also seems more indecisive in this story.  She's definitely entitled to these emotions, but that indecisiveness doesn't make her as likable as the stronger butt kicking heroines we're used to in fantasy.  Also, the episodes of 'what do I do' tend to derail the forward motion of the plot and stall the reader out.  These are spots where I as a reader get frustrated and tend to want to just skip.  While I read the entirely  of "Chained" I'm pretty certain I will skip the third book.       
 CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful.  A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn.  Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.  This may have been a let down  to his fans, not to mention that AI  has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it 
 its tough when you watch and work out to a video that has people leading that shouldn't be on film, this was a one time viewing that i cannot watch or try agai 
 Because I was a doting fan of Howard Keel when I was in high school I jumped on the chance to get a copy of his autobiography.  After reading it, let's just say I was a bit disappointed. I'm glad I read it though.  If I was "disappointed" it is because when you admire someone so much and they turn out to be rather "typical" in real life, it kind of tarnishes the unrealistic image you have him. For me it was like reading "One Man Tango" (by Anthony Quinn) all over again.   When a man focuses on all of his conquests and drops the names of fancy hotels in which they stayed, makes of cars they bought and then doesn't tie those names in with anything that was happening...well, it becomes a bit superficial.  Keel was honest, of course, but didn't elaborate much on the events in his life or give them much depth.   I prefer to go back to remember him as that devastatingly handsome leading man from "Kiss Me Kate" and "Show Boat" and listen to his music.  I think had he been interviewed by an experienced biographer, his story might have been told in a more cohesive and sensitive manner.   Autobio or not...Keel was a great performer and will long remain indelible in Hollywood's musical history.  
 I have to start by saying that one COULD do worse than follow Mr. Moench's Natural Diet, as it appears nutritionally sound.  However, one CAN do worse by purchasing this book.   It's dreadfully put together with crude, illegible copies of graphs and charts from unknown sources.  In fact, where most of the material this book used came from is anyone's guess. Nothing is footnoted.  It does have a bibliography, of sorts, with entries like "Tropical seed companies list: photocopy," "Sucrose: article," or "Leaf protein as human food: article."  additionally, these sources are very dated;  references to practices of "the Orient" (pg.41), "the Azurbaizanis" (pg. 19), and my favorite: "the Kaffir tribes of South Africa" (pg. 11) are just a few examples.  Despite the subtitle "Traditional Diets from around the World...", only a sentence or two is devoted to the diet of the cited cultures.   Finally, the author's biography states he is an alumni of St. Cloud State University.  I, too, am a graduate of SCSU, and while our alma mater is no ivy league institution, it does have fairly high academic standards.  I don't think this book would stand up there as a master's thesis, or in an English 101 class, for that matter.  I want my twenty bucks back 
 This book dragged on and on.  The ending was stupid and the plot was pathetic.  Very similiar to The Devil Wears Prada which was also bad.  Don't waste your time on this one 
 I found this book interesting, just as I found 'Sarah' an interesting read. I read them before all this came out or before I knew any of the fictional background of the "JT Leory" and I'm glad. Because I read it simply as a story, violent and shocking, but a story.  The main thing is this (because I don't want to get drawn into an argument): this is all about people's wounded feelings than the facts, as Laura Albert hasn't given them out.   There are novels written about child abuse. We accept them though. It is a part of the real world that an author may write about it, just as they can write about sex, drug addiction, cults, divorce, politics, religion, and death. Is the reason everyone is saying Laura Albert can't write about it is because we KNOW that's fiction when so many people hoped it was autobiography? It is not sick to write about it, when you consider so many other books are not condemned for writing about such topics.  To say what you cannot write about is censorship. I'm not putting it on the same level but 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' was initally banned because it wrote about sex, but it's a normal healthy part of adult life. Now we laugh about the ban. At the end of the day, a writer is a recorder, an observer. It has to be accepted that if things exist then they are part of our consciousness and a writer may write about them.   Fiction is about the realms of possibility and being able to write about what has happened, does happen and could happen. That is it. And that is everything 
 The concept is great, but it doesn't work: Cable modem, router, switch and wireless AP in one.  My WCG200 V2 locks up or reboots regularly whether wired or wireless.  I have tried doing a complete factory reset and leaving it unconfigured and still have ongoing resets/lockups.  Going to toss it in the trash as Linksys support has no solution and hasn't offered a replacement.  I offered to run beta firmware, anything to try to resolve.  Linksys: don't expect to see another $ from this customer.. 
 I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her! Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund 
 Very poorly written, frequently goes off on irrelevant tangents, clearly biased against Ballmer, MS and Bill Gates, and full of factual errors. His attempts to describe technology are laughable 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 The American Dream is an appealing myth, no doubt. The idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in America sounds great. The problem, as George Carlin put it, is that you have to be asleep to believe in it. So instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs. And that is where "Belly" comes in, an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it. This urban drama stars DMX (perpetually rapping), Nas, and Method Man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies. The story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs. When the plot does poke its head up I picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from Queens to Omaha. Once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot. One couple tries to escape to Africa, but find it easier said than done. And Tommy (DMX) is sent on a mission to kill a minister. But really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn't even exist. Come on now, I've known drug dealers in my day, and they didn't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do. Rather they live in shacks or their parent's basement.   If my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is. The directing by Hype Williams isn't that bad. He is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks. The lighting never seems quite right, but I'm gonna let that one slide. As a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films I can hardly complain about their presence here. There people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions. All that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that I am going to give it. As the most nihilistic person I know I am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost. Any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used. The N and F words are used to comedic proportions. Their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason. And then, on top of it all, we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us. Sorry man, but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn't make you any less slimy than those Wall Street hacks. You're still a businessman. This film is not worth watching. Any social point that is made is made accidentally, and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta. **1/4 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 This guide has a few useful hints of play, but not as many as one would expect for such a work. Most of the book is devoted to a unit list, but even that contains many errors and is of limited use because it is not tabulated for easy comparison. Some other lists are interesting, like the character trait list or the building list, but they are also similarly shallow. No in-depth analysis of the game workings is given, which would have been very useful.  I use it occasionally during play for the few tidbits it contains, but I do not recommend it at the price given 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 Black Stone Cherry's CD is the best album that I have ever bought! Every single song on the CD is awesome! I love it! I clicked on five stars but for some reason it is showing 2...THIS CD IS a 5 all the way!! 
 Having recently completed a Ph.D in a very similar topic, I was excited that maybe somebody was taking the evolving beauty of index investing to the masses. I was disappointed.  The book sets out a good case for index investing, specifically the use of ETFs'. For this the book must be commended. The author points out the shortcomings of a buy-and-hold strategy, as well as the pitfalls of active investment management, using traditional approaches. This sets the reader up to think there a panacea in store, which there is not.  He specifically goes to length to tell the reader that picking stocks and timing markets are futile attempts at building a portfolio, and yet his solution for an indexed portfolio? Pick ETFs' and time markets, neatly disguised as "tactical asset allocation" and "stop loss" strategies.  He states that strategic asset allocations are rigid, and therefore tactical asset allocations need to be applied, namely over/under weighting a portfolio according to what YOU think MIGHT happen in the market. This is nonsense. My research indicates that strategic asset allocations need not be rigid, and in fact I have found that by scientifically evaluating the strategic asset allocation periodically as much as 90 percent of a portfolio's expected return can be realised. No guesswork.  Surely the author knows that guesswork is subject to being correct a large part of the time. In fact research indicates at leat 80 percent of the time to match the market, so I find it bizarre that the entire buildup is deflated by offering nothing more than tired, useless strategies. To wit, he suggests applying tactical asset allocations to take advantage of the January effect. Has he not heard of the efficient market theory which is a fundamental part of index investing?  As for compiling a portfolio, he makes no mention of how this should be done, or explains modern portfolio theory. He indicates the futility of trying to find the next Microsoft, and yet shows how choosing the "right" indexes would yield higher returns than the market. A very confusing approach.  As for risk management, he espouses the use of stop losses. How bizarre. This is a market timing technique that could lead to excessive trading costs, and leaves one in a dilemma as to when to re-enter the market. A far more prudent approach is what is known as value averaging. If a required return has been breached on the upside remove money from the market. On the down side reinvest the surplus money. This technique yields a significantly higher IRR than a buy-and-hold strategy.   He proclaims that markets always move up in the long term. If you are Japanese I wonder how you feel about that.  The author does offer insights in the form of indexing, ETFs', asset allocation, rebalancing and other tidbits, but the book does not deliver any "revolutionary" approaches. A pity since he is on the right track. The work is sorely lacking in research and new insights.  
 Others who have said that piece is poor and boring are correct. Reich, just like Philip Glass, has lost his original style that we all loved to hear in the first place. He has replaced his original style with something that must be an attempt to make his music more palpable to a commercial audience. Unfortunately, this "new Reich" is very bovine and greatly insipid. I can only hope Reich returns to his true roots =and makes something for his real fans instead of pandering to yuppies. 
 When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc 
 This book is an obvious effort to cash in on anxious beginners looking to start their own medical billing practice. Most of this book has copied forms from other companies that sell billing software and pages of glossary terms.There is very little meat here and little effort I believe to actually help the beginner. The object here  I believe is,  to make a quick buck 
 The convoluted premise of the book is that you should obnoxiously badger the casino into giving you comps while endlessly playing Blackjack and feigning large bets.  Assuming you have no shame and find a casino that will put up with such antics, the sophomoric author promises that your expected mathematical losses will eventually be offset by getting free meals and hotel rooms.  A lot of sordid effort for a small return - bon appetite 
 This is just another rehashing of the same old reward and punishment doctrine.  There's little new or fresh here...in fact, the strategies in this book actually made things worse.  Not the book to read if you're  looking for real help with a child who hasn't responded to traditional  "good discipline.&quot 
 The pictures are pretty but the book is a boring read 
 I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December '06 (note, not these, already shelled ones) and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid.  Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts.  I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them 
 This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed.  First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20.  The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best.  The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.  Skip this one 
 Nuevamente, Coelho nos demuestra sin tapujos lo que es su principal interes. Ganar dinero con literatura barata y facilista destinada para dar a oir lo que se quiere oir sin compromiso, con una llanura mental rampante. Lastima de los arboles cortados para hacer el papel en el que se imprimio esta basura 
 There is probably no one in entertainment history who accomplished less alive and had more adulation dead than Jimmi Hendrix. If he is the standard, Adam Ant and Spandau Ballet should have died young- they'd be first ballot Rock N Roll Hall of Famers. WTF? 
 Besides reading this biography I suggest reading Paul E. Lovejoy's article, "Autobiography and Memory: Gustavus Vassa, alias Olaudah Equiano, the African."  A professor of history at York University in Canada, Lovejoy holds the Canada Research Chair in African Diaspora.  His paper can be found on line and in examining inconsistencies in the documentary record (only the baptismal record and one ship's muster list show South Carolina as a birthplace for Equiano) concludes convincingly that Vassa was not inventing his African childhood. 
 If Cass Pennant came up against 500 people with just him and his mate the 500 people would come off worse,well that's if your to believe this book.It's a good read but he does exagerate and it should be in the fiction section.Those Cockney's do like to bend the truth 
 So really, how important is this fruit, err vegetable, err fruit?  I mean, I like salsa, and a hamburger just would not be the same without catsup, err ketchup.  Come to think of it, spaghetti would not be the same either.  But eating these things plain is just silly.  The taste is not so bad, but the consistency is all messed up.  In conclusion, if you must have some tomato in your diet, please purchase tomato related products and not the tomato itself.  And why the heck isn't it spelled "tomatoe"?  Why is the "e" added for the plural form?  What gives 
 Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs 
 Trashy & obsequious. A gossipy journal of obliquely connected anecdotes about characters from the 80s and 90s art world, most of whom have lost most of their importance, and some of whom are even dead now. Begins with a section on the 70s minimalists and conceptualists, etc., by way of introduction. . . Not lacking in intelligence, but not employing much of it either. Haden-Guest places himself more strategically in the narrative than he most likely was in reality, but what journalist doesen't? Don't expect anything memorable or important (except perhaps the section on Donald Judd's various amusing feuds with native Texans and his rich European benefactors). I suppose it makes for good beach reading for those with a taste for the lurid. Be advised that it's also hopelessly dated (not documenting anything after the mid-nineties), which puts it in a strange position: it offers little information of historical significance, yet in the terms of the world it documents is now filled with ancient history! In short, an ephemeral amusement 
 Whitfield does a great service in providing these lovely photos of artworks that rarely are exhibited at the British Museum or the other museums in the West, presumably because of political considerations.  Even on the British Museum website it is difficult to see these wonderful paintings.  When will the BM get smart and showcase these awesome artworks to the world?  The design and use of graphics in this book are great.  Where the book falls down, and falls down hard, is in the text.  Mistakes in diction, punctuation, spelling, printing, spacing, countless dashes and colons, and endless run-on sentences with disconnected phrases, make Whitfield's prose almost unreadable.  The subject is so interesting, it seems inconceivable that the book could be boring, but it is.  Many of the paragraphs make little sense, and leave you wondering what she said.  The photo captions are just as bad.  If you, like me, are intrigued by this extraordinary man, I suggest you buy the discount version of this book for the pictures, and read the Walker biography for the story of Stein's life.  
 Just finished this book what a dissappointment. Dialog, Dialog, Dialog...no action no plot no idea what this strange little rant of a book is about. Thank goodness there is no test 
 Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.  The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.  One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.  All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.   The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.  The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it 
 The vendors never sent me the CD...I am very disappointed with the service this time through amazon.  
 It is interesting to read all the reviews here. I notice the reviews that begin -- "I know nothing about the Celts, their history, their religious beliefs...." then tend to gush on about how wonderful and thrilling and enlightening the White Goddess is. The reviews that begin -- "I know something about the Celts, their history and beliefs" then tend to continue with rational arguments explaining why The White Goddess is nonsense from beginning to end. So, for those who know nothing -- here is a quick course in Celtic history. The Celts were not Hebrews, Greeks, or Scythians. They didn't worship a Triple Goddess. They did not have a tree calendar based on the Oghams. I am proud of my Celtic heritage and find the White Goddess eternally annoying. Robert Graves was not a Celtic scholar. His theories disagree wildly with the theories of his own grandfather -- Charles Graves -- who was a respected scholar. Robert Graves takes a little bit of Welsh myth, a little bit of Irish myth, a lot of Greek myth, a lot of Bible myth, some ogham letters and mixes it all up into a warm mush perfect for the nourishment of fluffy-bunnies. This is  a bad book, based on a daft premise, and reading it is a waste of time

 I rented this movie because I really adore the two lead actors.  However, although they do the best they can, there is no saving this banal, movie of the week-esque movie.  There are a couple of nice moments, most notably when D'Onofrio's character talks about his father and about his love of football.  Other than that, the story seems to be cobbled together from many other "uplifting" movies.  At times, you can not only guess what will happen next, but can guess what the exact line will be.  Football hero becomes self-pitying after an accident leaves him blind (and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack--which she exposes in a tell-all book).  His tutor from school shows up, himself in a wheelchair, and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race.  Even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah-rah, he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver.  But first--you knew it!--they have to learn to trust each other.  This involves whacky stunts.  The two drive to the race, having adventures, learning about themselves and each other, suprising locals with can-do spirit.  Each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset.  Each person they run into is nutty.  And even though I said I liked this, the lines from the scene where Olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from "The Breakfast Club" where the jock talks emotionally about his dad.  Only the commitment of Hines and D'Onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all.  So to recap: Person who's cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself? Check. That person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory? Check. Another person who's been down that same road of self-pity and redemption comes along to save him? Check. Two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals? Yup. Student becomes teacher? Yes. Locals try to keep them down? Check. Other dreamers lend a hand? Drunk driving? Boy stunted emotionally by father? Bathroom humor? Improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders, and won to stirring music and cheers? All those who've been touched by the quest and who we've met along the way show up at the end? Suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what's really important?  Yes, yes, yes 
 what a load of rubbish - I very rarely give bad feedback as I know that it is easy to criticise BUT really this book is absolute rubbish.  Claims are made but not substantiated, putting a reference does not validate a claim.  The title is attractive and the summary compelling but the actual content insults any experienced marketing, or for that matter any business, reader's intelligence. If you want a laugh go to page 31 where the author says ""What happens when a "marketer pyramid" and a "consumer pyramid" come together...The result appears in figure 2-2".  Figure 2-2 shows two triangles with lines joining bits up BUT there is absolutly no content!!! - I laughed so much people sitting next to on the plane looked at me and I showed them the page. Five other people read the page and laughed at the audacity of what was being presented.  I will never buy another book from HBS Press. Where is the peer review? Where is the editorial control? Heaven help us if the current and future generations of HBS graduates are being taught, and accept(!) this garbage 
 This one's easy.  The lies start showing up even in the book description.  "The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories."  Actually the Zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially Israel, but the surrounding Arab nations attackeed immediately.  After the 1967 war, Israel offered virtually all the so-called West Bank, but without East Jerusalem, back to Jordan.  They offered Gaza back to Egypt.  They did not offer the Golan Heights back to Syria, because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for Syria's artillery.  Israel's offer of the West Bank and Gaza back to Jordan and Egypt was offered at a price: recognition, peace and negotiation.  At the 1967 Arab summit in Kartoum, the Arabs responded to Israel's offer with No, No and No.  Israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war, but under pressure from the U.S. and elsewhere, Israel did not.  After the war, in 1967, there was no talk of a Palestinian state in the territories.  For 19 years Jordan occupied the West Bank, and there was no Arab or Palestinian clamor for a Palestinian state.  For 19 years Egypt occupied Gaza, and there was similar silence.  There was no reason for Israel to talk about yet another Arab state when even the Arabs hadn't talked about it.  The whole idea of a Palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding Arab nations to make war against Israel by a new method: public relations.  If they could make the world believe that Israel was an occupier of lands not theirs, they hoped world opinion could defeat Israel where Arab armies could not.  Nevertheless, in 1973 the Arab nations tried yet again, but were trounced, and the war by public relations started to ramp up.  In my opinion, Neuman's solution, "The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.", shows real impoverishment of thought.  For almost 60 years the Middle East's Arab and Muslim nations have been trying, unsuccessfully, to destroy a nation that was recognized by the United Nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners, but it is Israel which must surrender?  At the time of Israel's creation, Arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee (at the request of the attacking Arab nations) were to be given full political rights, unlike, for example, Jordan (Transjordan at the time), in which Jews were not allowed to live.  In fact, although there is racism on the part of individuals in Israel, Israel itself is not a racist state.  It is the surrounding Muslim and Arab nations who are the racists.  In my opinion, Neumann's book, even if you consider only its Book Description, is trash in the spirit of the anti-Semitc Czarist forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 I tried to read this trash-book, here in Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read book about religion and history.And this is a trash-book.The core's idea of this trash-book is that, Popes were jew's enemies.   Well, even the most fanatic protestants recognizes, that there was a Pope in Rome, since at least 1,700 years ago.The RCC(Roman Catholic Church) claims that St. Peter was the first Pope in Rome an that he was living there in I Century.After at least 1,700 years, there's thousands of jews, living in Rome today.A comparation between Rome and Afghanistan( a country, bigger than France and England together, not a city) is that while there's thousand of jews in Rome, there was only two jews, in all Afghanistan in 2001.Both old, sick and poor jews.    Reading this book, we will see some "terrible" examples of anti-semithism from some Popes.In other words, because of Popes tragedies, came for all the mankind.This book is 100% biased and leads you, to absurds and bigoted conclusions.    The comparasion between Popes and famous jews, at the same times, shows without a drop of doubt, that famous jews were thousands of times worse than any Pope then living.To example, when Lenin(jew), Trotsky(jew) and a jewish-communist gang, promissed that the whole Chritianity will be soon, wiped out from the world, senteced to death tens of millions of christians in then Soviet Union.What "monster" was Pope living at that time?    Mussolini had enormous money's support from famous and rich jews.Mussolini also got power with a decrete from an excomunicated italian king.Mussolini went to eugenics movement, following bad advices from eugenicists (many of them jews) from Italy and also, from the USA.RCC was the biggest enemy of eugenics.In fact, eugenics was a jewish, protestant, marxist and feminist business.    Hitler himself got enormous amounts of money, from former USSR and famous and rich americans.The vast majority of them, were jews or deeply linked to jews.You can read a book about american money to Hitler, on the Book "Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler".The author of this excellent book is Anthony Sutton and this book is available here, in Amazon.    There's nothing showing any money's supply, from catholic church to Lenin, Mussolini or Hitler.At the same time, every serious historian, knows that famous and rich jews gave enormous amounts of money to all of these murders.    In the last century, while famous jews exterminated more than 40,000,000 faithfull catholics, not a single jew was mudered following Pope's orders.In fact regognizing the Pius XII's support to jews in Rome, the rabin of that city was coverted to the roman catholicism.The real title for this trash-book must be: The Jews Against the Popes.          
 What is this person trying to prove? Most of this book was created on a racist bent, not very professional if you ask me. Shouldn't we be enjoying their gifts to mankind, instead of crying about something so petty and childish? Egypt was a melting pot, GET OVER IT! Besides, the race of these wonderfull people shouldn't matter. Quit befouling a glorious culture with modern day "politics." 
 The producers of Lost once said that the reason the show has worked so amazingly well, is because the audience is keen, sharp, and aware of what's going on. They think of ideas that the writers may or may not have thought of on their own, they uncover secrets the writers were trying to hide - in summary, the audience is nowhere near stupid. Nor do they need to be hit on the head with clues or messages to heed what the writers were trying to say. And yet, this is exactly what Endangered Species did. It treated the reader as if he were stupid, as if he wouldn't be able to understand anything past the obvious. As a an avid fan of the show, I was a bit offended that the reader should be treated in such a... stupefying manner. And as a writer, I'm even *more* surprised at the book! The Producers of the show have such a cache of talented writers on their crew, would be able to find better ones if they wished to, and yet somehow they came out with *this*. A completely predictable plotline and a main character one can barely sympathize with. To be fair, the author had a lot to compensate for. The fact that Faith couldn't be part of the main mystery, couldn't have *that* much interaction with the main characters. No original mysteries of her own could be created unless it was kept completely separated from the main plot of the show, and was unimportant to the welfare of the lostaways as a whole. As a whole, it was pretty unentertaining. The only reason I would recommend reading it would be to idle away the time 
 This airbed leaked slowly from day one. I sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one. I do not recommend this product. 
 Banks can be forgiven for making his heroine unbelievable.  Unfortunately, she is also unsympathetic and uninteresting.  That's quite an achievement; after all, Hannah Musgrave is a terrorist, lesbian chimp-keeper who runs a farm, helps spring a Liberian dictator from prison, and raises three guerilla rebels.  Banks does a much better job with the real-life terrorist John Brown.  Skip 'The Darling' and read 'Cloudsplitter' instead 
 These illustration are mediocre at best and I wish I had realized that they were an artists interpretation of monsters from historical sources, not direct images. Darn 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 As a fan of the Amercian Idol who favor in R&B, I had some hopes for Clark's CD, sadly my hopes were destroyed with this CD. Clark's voice is falestto which should have worked wonders on his cover of Debarge's All This Love,surpsinsgly it sounds horrible. The only song worth anything is his duet with Sarah Stokes (Makin The Band). One would think that if a CD has  high profile superstar featured guest spots from the Black Eyed Peas, NE-Yo and Scott Storch it could be reedmed, sadly it isn't. 
 I have read certain books i'e Noel Jerkes, ASP unleashed which are for itermediteat to advance but they easy, clear to undertsand than this one. I have also seen reviews problem of custom dll's which abolutely write. Using Stored procedures like Noel's books make you understand the topic

 I was initially delighted to stumble upon this new series.  I love the premise of an older protagonist and the Cotswold setting; I even loved the cover.  Imagine my shock when I got to page 158 and read the following dialogue as spoken by one of the characters:  ".... the circumstances perfectly obeyed the rites of Wicca.  He had been impaled by a pitchfork through the throat, pinned to the ground so his blood would flow into the soil, to nourish it -"  I don't know what sources Ms. Harwin utilized in her writing of this novel, but as a practitioner of Wicca myself for 15 years, I can attest to the fact that nowhere in our religion does impaling - or ANY kind of bloodletting - "obey the rites of Wicca".  In fact it is quite the opposite, as the first and foremost rule of Wicca is `Harm None'.  Wicca is a defined, well-documented religion with very specific principles and practices, with strict rules against harming anyone, EVER.      Before I reached that page I'd actually been in Barnes and Noble earlier that day looking for a copy of the next in the series.  They didn't have it, and now I'm glad they didn't.    Harwin's careless, uneducated passing comments in this book are not only offensive but extremely irresponsible. I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a writer.  I'm sorry that this promising series has now been ruined for me. 
 For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested.  I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling.  When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, "I didn't think of that one."  The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters.  The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained.  There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended.  It left me wanting to know more.... 
 I'm very disappointed with this book.  It touches on some concepts that could be useful but there is absolutely nothing in this book a PHP programmer can put to use right away.  I've built several web sites using PHP/MySQL and there is not one single thing in this book useful to me.  The book is mainly a survey of concepts, NOT an advanced programming guide.  Nothing in this book is fleshed out completely enough to actually begin using it in programming your website.   If you want to actually use any of the ideas in the book, you will have to find a better source of information and documentation for the particular idea or technology.  For example, the book has a decent introduction to the Smarty template system but not enough info to actually start using it effectively.  There are no performance or feature comparisons between Smarty and other template systems so I'm not even sure how you're supposed to decide if Smarty is right for you (the author merely mentions that Smarty is popular, not why you should or should not use Smarty).  Another example: the book talks about three different load generators and gives examples of their use (about 1.5 pages each) but definitely not enough details to begin using any of them.  The only thing of value I got from this book is a conceptual understanding of reverse proxies.  Of course, if you actually want to implement a reverse proxy yourself, you're going to need a lot more information than you'll find in this book.  I gave this book two stars instead of one because it is a halfway decent survey.  The title, however, is totally inappropriate.  It has nothing to do with advanced PHP programming.  Instead, the title should be, "Shallow Survey of Concepts and Tools Related to PHP and Web Development" 
 You have to use the Speck USB cap if you use this skin, and it introduces noise to my iPod Shuffle, which I hate very much. It's good protection but you've got to give up some audio quality for it... 
 Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT... CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy. CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant. CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch?  Arrowroot?  Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores.  File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal. CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index.  Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book. PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts. PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.  
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 A neighbor gave me this book to read.  I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact.  Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line.  This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin "Orthodox" Christianity as the only true religion and the "Orthodox" point of view the only "true" history of the last 2000 years.  The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda.  One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or "Orthodox" Christianity.  The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered "Millions" of heretics.  The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand.  So which is worse?  Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered?  Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people?  (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the "heretics" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.)  Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud.  You should read how these "Orthodox" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus.  Here's what they say.  The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family.  This is a very "unorthodox" and "unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First.  What does Brother Paul say about it     11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   I think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a "new age" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story.  This spin also flies in the face of Christian History.  And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well.  So what?  Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is "true" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?   Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest.  Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing.  Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda.  However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in "Cracking Da Vinci's Code." 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 I like Bryan Peterson's other books (Learning to see Creatively and Understanding Exposure) and I was guessing that this would be a combination of the two with some additional tips towards digital photography. I expected a lot out of the book, and it didn't come out. First of all, the 'photography' part of the book is good. Many examples and tips on how to make better pictures. But the 'digital' part of the book is bad, really, really bad. Virtually every advice Bryan gives is wrong, or given for the wrong reason. You get the idea that mr. Peterson wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon without knowing anything about digital camera's in the first place. I bought the book to give it to a friend who just got his first digital camera, and I wanted to see if it would be a keeper for myself. I'm keeping it, but only because I'd be ashamed to give it to somebody. Again, the photography tips are good, and if it wasn't for the author, I would have given it three stars. But I was expecting something better 
 There is some useful information about composition and design in the first section, but the bulk of this book is full of generalities and common sense information that won't be of much use to the aspiring photographer. A better option is John Freeman's "The Photographer's Guide to Composition. 
 Sadly though, it does not even come close to being reanimated.  This book is laughable at best.  The only reason I could not put it down was because I wanted to see what cliche Wellington decided to use next.  The entire plot is non-sequitir.  The storytelling style -- switching between time frames -- is only complicated by Wellington's inability to decide on a verb tense.  That is, of course, when the plot is not completely ridiculously campy and predictable.    I knew I was going to hate it by the third or fourth chapter.  Granted, it wouldn't be a zombie novel without a corpse bride, but the pigeons and the undead Scottish zombie?  Huh?    I was honestly excited to read this novel, but sadly and sorely disappointed in the end.  If you want to rehash the same old tired zombie scenarios, then this might be the book for you, but it's definitely not "breakthrough" anything or "energetic" whatsoever.  If you don't expect too much, you might just barely escape being let down 
 I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else.   The two leads are so stereotypical, it hurts. Lastly, the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal French accents that actually impede understanding of what's being said, and then he has French people speak to each other in these accents - way overdone. Then, layered on that, they are explaining things to each other that any French person would already know (cle de voute, for example) for the reader's benefit.   Taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie Van Helsing for me - I'm watching that thinking "a werewolf, and vampires? and frankenstein? and hot chicks? why, it's got everything! what next?" Short attention span theater. The fact that this book is so popular makes me sad 
 George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie.  He is much better in light-hearted movies like "Fun With Dick and Jane."  The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter.  The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.    This spy movie is not even in the same league with "Day of the Jackel" and "The Odessa File."  I threw away my copy of "The Quiller Memorandum" after watching it once.  I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again 
  Great watch,manual very bad.All depends on how much time you have to invest.It will take it because of sorry manual 
 When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice. He is a criminal and must be treated like one. Christian Peper  
 Why do people seem to find it necessary to focus on the dark aspects of a person? I think that's an important question to ask of this book. Steel seems only interested in deconstructing Bobby Kennedy. No consideration is paid to the positive parts (of which there are many) of the man and his legacy. I felt that Steel was merely writing the book to sound clever or different. I really didn't see much substance 
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 I got this book to learn about noise for my upcoming post-doctoral studies.  Unfortunately, it is the worst popular science book I have ever read (and I read alot of 'em).  Kosko glosses over certain topics that require much more explanation to fully understand, while going in-depth into other, more uninteresting examples in a redundant and boring fashion.  He often throws out rather complex concepts as if the reader must know what it is, which makes for such a bumpy ride. Do you know the difference between positive and negative frequency is?  Kosko will assume you do.  I have been tempted several times to throw the book down and give up on it.  Want a good pop sci book, try Brian Greene or James Gleick.  
 I bought this because I liked the idea of having the water filter inside. You can't find replacement filters. You can't measure the water correctly. I tried just pouring water in from a cup. That didn't work because it goes right into the water filter so it looks like it is at level 3 when it is more.  The last straw was the other day as the water started to brew through the basket, the basket sprang open. I had water everywhere. It also seems to take a while to brew a small pot of coffee. I usually made a 3 or 4 cup pot and it took 8 minutes. I will never buy a coffee pot from this company again.  
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
      This book is full of superficial platitudes from the New Age Rainbow Coalition of the 1980s, John Marks Templeton, then Norman Vincent Peale (Mason and Shriner) and Robert Schuller ("Hour of Power" television program; do most weird things come from California?). This is the Gospel of Success and Possibility Thinking. His book, like "The Course in Miracles" teaches that "forgiveness" is simply recognizing that sin does not exist and therefore there is nothing to forgive. To accept the Courses teachings is to reject all Biblical doctrine, yet those who embrace it are able to call themselves Christians.        Like Courses, "A New You" is the  promotion to ignore our sinful nature, which is right in line with Schuller's philosophy. This non-offensive positive gospel of to "believe in SELF" is hardly new. This new reformation is not repentance or a renewed sense of dependence on God and his word. No humbling ourself before Almighty God. In fact it is the very opposite, a boosting of ourselves to a "divine self-esteem." (Schuller was helped into ministry by Masonic brother Billy Graham.) Schuller's salvation was one of eliminating the pain of fear. To Schuller, "faith" is visualization, a power of the mind; "God" is there to help one "believe" and activate our mind power which will change our environment. Schuller smiles as he says "now believe and you will achieve." He declares in "Self-Esteem:" "Christ was the world's greatest possibility thinker. Do we dare follow him?" Peale has said, "Positive thinking is just another term for faith." The Bible says "God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."       It would be better to define sin, demonic influences, hell, salvation, the gospel, and the term "born again." The Bible tells us that we are all sinners; our righteousness is like filthy rags before God, that we've all sinned and fall short of His glory, and that there are none who are naturally good or righteous. The Christian strategy is the attempt to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition. This book is psychology and it has come into the church disguised as a help to our self worth. But this is HUMANISN and is antithetical the very essence of the gospel. Read I Tim. 1:15. (Google search: schuller minister).       This book is full of disturbing thoughts: We should seek angels as our protectors and intercessors (207). Try nature worship! "Nature is nourishment for our souls" (197). We must turn over a new leaf (self-reformation); "this is a new day" (195). Imagination is the key to the door of  the future (62). You can have whatever you say if you believe in your heart and doubt not. Your imagination [not faith] creates your reality (59). You can lift up YOURSELF into the realm where all things are possible (245, don't give God the glory). We are Christians if we remain positive (173). Faith is though our own efforts of "persistence and determination" (79). God loves everyone, that's why He made so many unbelievers. Therefore everyone is basically good in God's eyes. You must bring out that love of God [whoever is your God] and the goodness within yourself to realize your salvation, because God is love, and love never fails (229). There is NO mention of Jesus as personal Savior, only the universal force "Master Map Maker" (241, so no faiths will be offended). Every member [every life form, including trees and birds] of God's creation is linked by a common thread; watch nature for the answers (233, shades of PANTHEISM). "We [all] are sons and daughters of the magnificent King" (173, NO Biblical salvation needed !!!). 
 Alfred McCoy's A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror, is a timely and informative book. The CIA's recent and ongoing use of torture, with George W. Bush's support and encouragement, is one of the most outrageous aspects of the so-called "War on Terror." I assume that much of the book's history of CIA torture techniques and practices is accurate. But I am personally familiar with at least two strands of that "history," and McCoy's discussion of those strands is wildly inaccurate.  The strand I'm most familiar with is Stanley Milgram's famous research on obedience to authority. I was Milgram's first graduate research assistant in those experiments, and more recently I've reviewed the Milgram Archives at Yale University to remind me of the details. Milgram died in 1984, so he cannot respond to McCoy's misstatements concerning the obedience experiments, but I'll give an indication here of their general drift. McCoy asserts (p. 47) that Milgram had "close ties" to the Office of Naval Research, which in turn was involved in a "close collaboration" with the CIA and with the field of experimental psychology (p. 31). I don't know how closely the ONR worked with the CIA (McCoy's evidence on that point is vague at best). Though I think the book exaggerates the CIA's collaboration with experimental psychologists throughout Chapter 2, it is true that some such collaborations have occurred and may still be occurring. But Stanley Milgram never had "close ties" with the ONR, or any ties at all with the CIA. Early in his academic career he wrote simultaneous inquiries to the ONR, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Mental Health, briefly describing his plans for research on obedience to destructive authority and asking whether one of those federal agencies might be interested in funding the research. At that time the ONR supported a wide variety of social-scientific research programs without insisting on any practical Navy components, so young social psychologists often saw it as a potentially soft touch. But the NSF was more encouraging to Milgram, so he didn't pursue ONR or NIMH funding further. When the NSF granted him most of the money he asked for, his obedience research was off and running. McCoy attempts to keep the ONR in the picture via a very shifty sentence: "...the NSF gave Milgram a substantial $24,700 grant - an exceptional mix of caution and largesse that hints at NSF reluctance and possible ONR or CIA pressure." Sorry, but such "reluctance" and "pressure" exist only in McCoy's mind. Milgram asked for $30,348 in direct and indirect costs to cover two years of research on obedience, whereupon the NSF gave him roughly 80% of what he requested - not at all an "exceptional" reduction in a beginning researcher's proposed budget.  McCoy goes ahead to characterize Milgram's research in consistently negative terms, even wondering "why the NSF would have funded an experiment of so little scientific value" (p. 49). He suggests, on the basis of admittedly "circumstantial" evidence, that "Milgram's experiment was a by-product of the larger CIA mind-control project." Though its scientific value was so trivial, according to McCoy, it answered "the key question the agency faced as it began global dissemination of its interrogation [i.e., torture] method": Would "ordinary police officers in Asia and Latin America be willing to practice what they had been taught?" (p. 49). Here I'd like to make several quick points, for which much non-circumstantial evidence is available elsewhere: (1) Plenty of "ordinary police officers" and military personnel around the world have demonstrated over and over again their willingness to torture prisoners on command; the CIA didn't need Milgram's results to be certain of that. (2) Far from being "of so little scientific value," Milgram's research has been recognized from its initial publication as one of the most important social-psychological experiments ever done; it continues to be widely cited more than 40 years after its completion. (3) The most important conclusion to be drawn from Milgram's research is not that most police or military officers in the chain of command will torture prisoners if ordered to do so, but that many ordinary men and women without extensive training will likewise torture fellow humans, if somebody in an even vaguely authoritative position tells them to do so. Milgram did not have the CIA's needs in mind when he conceived and carried out his research. He was instead concerned with why so many ordinary Germans had become (as the title of another book put it) "Hitler's Willing Executioners," and with whether or not (in the title of still another book) "It Can't Happen Here." His grim conclusion was that it CAN happen here. When his research results became widely disseminated, in the mass media and in many psychology textbooks, large numbers of college students and other US citizens became more attentive to the message of a popular post-Milgram bumper sticker: "QUESTION AUTHORITY." Surely that message could not have been popular with the authoritarian CIA types whom McCoy fancies as having plotted to support Milgram's research and his advancement in the academic world.  I'm also very familiar with the research of social psychologist Irving L. Janis, whom McCoy sees as somehow "recommending the sort of experiment Milgram now proposed" (p. 47), and as also somehow furthering the CIA's torture program with his own research on groupthink and other psychological phenomena. I won't take up further space here to discuss McCoy's exaggerations and misinterpretations of Janis's work. Instead I recommend that you read both Milgram's book Obedience to Authority and Janis's book Victims of Groupthink, to get a clearer sense of the anti-authoritarian agenda shared by these extraordinarily creative researchers. Meanwhile I'm left wondering how much I can trust the rest of McCoy's book - the parts that I don't have enough background knowledge to assess. Does anyone care to comment 
 I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.  Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.  They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.  DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.  You've got to be con artist to sell these things 
 Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
 I was given this book for my birthday and I tried to read it. I had such a hard time reading the book which seemed to drag on and on. Eco seems to go into tangeants and details such mundane scenes that I didn't get past page 30. I am an avid reader and have read everything from fiction to non-fiction to classics. I just couldn't get into the book and found it difficult to read 
 I made it about half way through this one before i said, "This is the worst book i have ever read".  (And i have read a bunch of books).  I am just sorry there is no rating below one star 
 I had high hopes for this book. There are too many parts that feel self-serving and pointless. I felt like I was reading the author's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation. The material on IDEO could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader. I found the preface by one of the author's former professors to be the best part of the book. I would not recommend buying this book 
 If you are trying to work through your depression, then this book isn't for you.  For the common layperson, this book is too technical. It tells about the history of lithium, it's full of charts, diagrams of the brain, and statistics.  There is a whole section on having someone committed and  costs.  I'm sure this information may be valuable to some people, but the  book should be titled something else. I don't see how it benefits someone  "Overcoming Depression".  Most of the pertinent information about  this illness can be found in other resources.  Save your money 
 This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
 After reading the book "Ask and it is given" and realy enjoying these wonderful teachings I was very excited to learn that a new book is available. I could not wait to order it and the day I received it I started to read right away, in excitement  to find more teachings. Much to may dissapointment I found out the the book "The amazing Power of deliberate intent" is almost a total copy of the first book, with the same storys and even the same excercises 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway 
 How can a group fall as far as they did?  "Who Can You Trust" and "Big Calm" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another).  Now with "FoF" it just went down hill...and never came back 
 I purchased this guitar for my young boys. The strings don't stay in tune long enough to tune them all together. I put lighter strings and new tuners on it, but that did not help. I didn't expect much, but it should at least be able to be tuned. 
 Everyone who reviewed this piece o' crap 1 star had the right idea. Now, let me drive the point home further: this song is pathetic. Billy Joe should really quit whining about how he "walks alone". After all, Green Day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame Nirvana retread. So sorry, but you don't walk alone. Maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money, I wouldn't be so opposed to this song.  I've heard it said that this song has emotion. That's great...where? I know it's not in the bored way Billy Joe sings his uninspired, typical "Nobody-loves-me-even-though-I'm-also-a-rock-star-and-I-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-I'm-a-sellout-I'll-sing-about-being-a-loser" lyrics. You want emotion? Listen to Bell Bottom Blues by Derek & the Dominoes. You can tell that Eric Clapton meant every word he said. With this annoying track, all you can tell is that Green Day is a highly overrated group. If they don't stop playing this song, and fast, I don't know what I'll  do. 
 This book might be helpful as a starting point for someone who knows nothing about lymphedema. It read like a tired retread of the information the American Cancer Society dispenses for free. Since I experience a direct  correlation between protein intake and arm swelling, I was hoping the  authors would go into far greater diet detail than their short chapter on  nutritional supplements. Save your money -- there is nothing new here 
 After original Jethro Tull guitarist Mick Abrahams left Jethro Tull following their debut LP, he formed Blodwyn Pig which seems almost like his answer to Tull. BP also features a flute guy, Jack Lancaster who doubles on sax. Music is a typical mediocre bluesey/jazzy prog mish mosh of this area that doesn't leave much of an impression(file with mid to late period Family) in comparisson to the heavyweights of the day (Crimson,Tull,Yes,Gentle Giant,etc.)I understand that their 1st album "A Head Rings Out" is supposed to be superior, but I've never actually heard it.One reviewer calls this "American jazz ?". They were a British group 
 The first Jonathan Kellerman book I've read... And my last.  Too slow.  I'm a big fan of the murder/mystery genre but this one is a big flop 
 Director:  Jamie Blanks Cast:  Denise Richards, David Broeanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel, Katherine Heigl, Hedy Burress, Fulvio Cecere. Running Time:  96 minutes Rated R for strong horror violence, some sexuality and language.  "Valentine", the over-slasherized version of the excellent Tom Savage suspense novel, starts with a pre-teen valentine disco set in 1988. A bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with. First he approaches Shelly (later played by Katherine Heigl) who embarrassingly rebuffs him. His charm doesn't seem to work with Lilly (Jessica Cauffer), Paige (Denise Richards) or Kate (Marley Shelton) either; they all send him packing quite arrogantly. His luck changes when Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw) actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand. They are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies. In order to save her own self from persecution, Dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge. They cover him in red gooey stuff ("Carrie" anyone?), strip him, and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up.  Fast forward ten years and the girls are now women; no one is sure what happened to Jeremy (the bullied brat from earlier) as he disappeared after that dance. It's close to Valentine's Day (of course) and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives. They soon realize to take them seriously when Shelly is found with her throat sliced. Before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving Kate and her boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz) to work out that she's next on the psycho's list.  The acting is standard horror fare. Denise Richards once again shows us her amazing and wide-range acting talents: Those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call "breasts." David Boreanaz gives a fair performance, but definitely shouldn't give up his day job on the WB's "Angel." Newcomer Marley Shelton can't do much with her underwritten role, and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part. The rest of the acting is close to pitiful. Another problem with Valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it's almost impossibility for them to win over the audience. In the beginning they're shown as mockers to any child that's unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain. This discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date, simply because they're not up to their high standards. How can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive? In a typical slasher movie, the `final girl' is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards, like Laurie Strode. These characters have no such power, leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway.  Director Jamie Banks ("Urban Legend") has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker; however this is his first feature failure. It's a shame that he couldn't have made more of the talented cast and competent budget, but in the end, Valentine just feels empty. A couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones. Cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart.  This one's destined to escape our memories in the not-too-distant future 
 This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.  Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality 
 Before clicking the link on this page for this film I knew that someone would say VERY BAD MOVIE, OR VERY BAD FILM, it is awful, but me and my friend use to laugh when we'd mention the title of this film and at the end when he's spinning around in a wheelchair. How can some of the best actors be in such a film, great cast, bad script, bad movie, it's stupid, and very violent, there are parts that are funny though like when Daniel Stern says "Have you done this before"? when he knew what to do with the body. Yes it is awful, it really is. The darkest "comedy" ever, they went way too far. It's almost as sick as the movie FREEWAY another movie with great actors in such a terrible film. Atrocious films. 
  This past November, I was in Reno, Nevada.  Mrs. Van Owen, the shuttle driver who picked me up at the airport (women are always picking me up) pointed out the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral as she was pulling into my hotel's parking lot, and she said, "That's the church they used in the movie SISTER ACT."  Had it been ANY other church, I would have thought, Great, now how much do the video poker machines pay out on four deuces here?  But it just so happens that when I was in Reno on August 12, 2001, Jesus sent me to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral  (although I'm not Catholic) where I was the only White person to be found in the pews, and where I observed a Catholic mass delivered entirely in Spanish.  (The only Spanish I know is "Si", "No", and some words that Ricky Garcia called me in junior high school.)  I kept thinking, Nice music, Lord, but why did You send me here?  It wasn't until the mass ended and I exited the church, that He revealed His purpose:  On the steps of that very cathedral, Jesus, with a "miraclette", answered an important and troubling question that I'd been praying about for an entire month.  (That's a story for another review.)  So when my shuttle driver mentioned that particular church being used in the movie SISTER ACT, I determined to rent the 1992, WHOOPI GOLDBERG vehicle upon my return to Airheadzona.  I'm back and I did.  Now, I grew tired of Goldberg's sassy, mononote thing a long time ago ("You want me to do WHAT?!  Uh-uh.  You got the WRONG woman, fool!"), so I wasn't expecting much, and my expectations were met but not exceeded.  I knew this thing was going to be nun too good when I saw Harvey Keitel mentioned in the opening credits.  (I have a rule of thumb: "Avoid EVERYTHING with Harvey Keitel in it."  But since there's an exception to almost every rule, I'll add, "except maybe TAXI DRIVER.")  SISTER ACT's bad habits started immediately:  It opens with a scene at "Saint Anne's Academy in 1968" (with the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral playing the part of Saint Anne's Academy in one brief shot.  Boo! I rented THIS movie for THAT?)  Here we find Deloris Van Cartier (later played by Goldberg) as a youngster being asked by a nun to name the apostles.  She gives a "Fabulous" (but incorrect) answer.  Cut to Van Cartier many years later performing as the leader in a girl group retro act at a Reno lounge, and showing great unhappiness at being ignored by the nearby boozers and gamblers.  Is it really unusual for free entertainment on a casino floor to go scarcely noticed? Would this REALLY upset a longtime lounge singer?  Wouldn't she be used to the lack of attention while on stage by now?  It would be the norm; just another day, just another paycheck.  We've got nonsense right out of the chute, I thought.  The two-bit Reno nightclub singer, Van Cartier, accidentally witnesses her boyfriend, Vince LaRocca, orchestrate a young man's murder.  (HARVEY KEITEL plays the evidently sight-challenged mobster.  He couldn't find a more attractive two-bit nightclub singer in all of Reno?  Please!)  Now Van Cartier is (a soon-to-be nun) on the run.  Until LaRocca's murder charge comes up for trial, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (BILL NUNN, who must have gotten the part based only on his last name) places Van Cartier in a convent under the Witness Protection Program.  The hulking Nunn is horribly miscast and gives a downright embarrassing performance as a lawman.  Trying to pass this guy off as a street-hardened, high-ranking law enforcement officer is like trying to pass off Garfield the cat as a police dog!  Nunn plays most scenes with this goofy "oh-you-kid" grin.  (Sit down Lieutentant before you hurt yourself!)  Meanwhile, gangster LaRocca - awaiting his murder trial, yet incredibly free to roam the city (What? Did he have a "Get Out Of Jail" card tucked into his "violin case"?) - and his two unintimidating, geriatric hitmen, are trying to locate Van Cartier to enunciate with gunfire their displeasure at her willingness to testify.  In the convent, Van Cartier's life is adhering to the typical Hollywood formula - "the outcast finds her niche and makes good" paint-by-numbers kit.  You know the gig!  And we're treated to all the usual: Tough and/or cool street people in ridiculously exaggerated "tough and/or cool street people" costumes (how about just T-shirts and jeans, folks?  You know, like REAL people on the street wear?); the gag where three guys simultaneously rush through a small opening and momentarily get stuck a la The Three Stooges (Har!-Har!-Har!); and of course, the obligatory and ubiquitous bit where the guys take it in the "family jewels" while the heroine makes good her escape.  (The nutcracker shtick ceased to be fresh and funny about 1976, but they're still feeding it to us regularly because, you know, there's little genuine writing talent in Tinsel Town.  Or haven't you noticed?)  There are about 101 additional problems with this act, Sisters and Brothers, but there's no point in listing them all; it's not like you're going to pay attention to anything I say anyway.  (The nuns fly to Reno to rescue Van Cartier because... uhm... there was no way to telephone Reno Law Enforcement?  That's just a guess on my part.  "Ain't nun of ya in the habit of keeping any spare change around, pray tell?")  I did enjoy the clever musical arrangements, and Goldberg's prayer before supper at the convent was appropriately inappropriate.  But I loved Mary Wickes in the minor role of Sister Mary Lazarus, the ancient but tough-as-General MacArthur nun.  I thought she had the best lines in the movie. ("I liked my convent in Vancouver, out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern like some of these newfangled convents.  We didn't have electricity - cold water, bare feet - THOSE were nuns!...it was hell on earth; I loved it!  This place is a Hilton.")  You go, Sister!  Discipline those Pillsbury Dough Boy-soft troops!  Still, I can think of better uses for my time than watching SISTER ACT.  (Sleeping, eating, reading, and writing a negative review of SISTER ACT all come immediately to mind.)  Hey, I love a fun, stupid comedy (e.g., The Pink Panther Strikes Again or Monty Python And The Holy Grail), but because it actually asks us to accept as plausible its preposterous scenario, SISTER ACT is dumber than a lobotomized moron with paralyzed vocal cords.  Making it, of course, the ideal movie for postliterate America.  Whoopi!  (I hear what you're thinking: Why is he always knocking America?  But I'm not!  I'm always criticizing America, and there's a difference: 2 more syllables and 3 more letters!) 
 I have been on the Beverly Hills Diet twice. I am pretty good about staying within the strict guidelines of diets like this. The first time was quite effective and I lost seventeen pounds over three weeks.  I tried this again a few years later and while I stuck with it and lost about thirteen pounds again, I have to say I cannot recommend this diet.  I believe the initial three week program is too difficult for most people and too stressful on the body.  I happened to be taking my first trip to Hawaii when I was into my second week. I was only thirty at the time and not in bad shape.  I was jogging a couple nights and felt an inordinate amount of stress on my heart so I decided to stop running on both days.  The diet is too fruit centered for too long. Some days are difficult because you may dislike foods like papaya so you can get into trouble. As for living the Beverly Hills diet lifestyle, it will be unrealistic expensive and difficult for most people.  As most doctors would probably tell you, you can eat an aweful large amount of fruit without taking in many calories. That is likely why the diet works.  Because of the kind of nutrition the diet provides over an extended period of time, my opinion is this diet is dangerous. That is the reason it was modified. If your personality is such that you must lose weight quickly, far easier, more nutritious and less dangerous is the cabbage soup diet. The insanity lasts only a week, you can lose 7 to ten pounds and by the third day you are already incorporating starches and protiens making it a breeze. Its simple and one page long that can be downloaded from the internet. It doesn't pretend to be a lifestyle. After that find a diet you can LIVE with every day of your life 
 not a great movie... someone made a comment in these reviews about.."Have you ever screwed up unintentionally in a relationship?".. and all i can think is please, the guy in this movie goes out with another girl cause he wants to sleep with her, even tho he doesnt want to admit it to himself, but he does admit it to his friend... he knew what he was doing when he went out with that other girl, it wasnt unintentional, he was a jerk, and he deserved what she put him thru, i found the main actress very funny, and i dont understand why she wanted this jerk back, wont she keep wondering if hes straying? its kinda sad, if a guy with a g/f that pretty strays, what hope is there? i suppose not all guys are jerks...  this movie was a rollercoaster, shes showing his whos boss, and he shows her they make eachother jealous, blah blah blah.. 
 I made an errant judgment by not reading the reviews about the DVDs missing the original soundtrack before buying the whole collection.  I'm totally pissed because the show just isn't the same without it.  The original soundtrack was such an essential part of the show and the cheesy replacement doesn't give it the same vibe or consistency throughout the show.  The people responsible should be ashamed for releasing this show on DVD without it's original soundtrack.  I wonder if the tapes that were released a few years ago had the original soundtrack?  If so, i'll just buy those and transfer them to DVD 
 After reading the reviews of this book here on Amazon, and running across mentions of this book in lots of other places that talk about comics & graphic novels, I was really looking forward to reading it.  But on the whole, I've been very disappointed.  Although the book covers a lot of relevant topics, it does so in a way that seems sloppy and self-congratulatory.  The book could do with a thorough proofreading to catch the numerous typos and other errors, and the author seems more concerned with impressing the reader than in making the topics easy to grasp and apply.  I'm really surprised to find that this isn't a better introduction to the art & craft of visual storytelling 
 After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder.   When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.  I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.  I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.  UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return) 
 Beware! This book is no serious science book, it's no more than a paper-incarnation of a big poor joke.. Unfortunately, it's the textbook being used in my fluid dynamics class and I had to buy this one. But if you have a choice, pick "Fluid Mechanics, Third Edition (Hardcover) by Ira M. Cohen (Author), Pijush K. Kundu (Author)"! It is easily understandable and nice to read and covers all important concepts and equations in a reasonable form!!  In contrast, this book by Bruce R. Munson does not even derive the heart of fluid dynamics, the Navier Stokes equation in general (just a washed down version in one coordinate system, written in components), nor does it derive the Bernoulli equation in an appropriate way to emphasize the restrictions and applicability.. Also, almost every equation is given in components, not utilizing vector (or tensor) notation... This hides the beauty and natural look of the equations and makes it just worse to read..  Overall, this is a really bad book, stay away from it 
 I'm mystified about how this can be one of the biggest selling HAND volumes. I think "Smoke From A Distant Fire" is passable 70s shlock, but the rest looks pathetically bad. I guess it's "Disco Duck", "Devil Woman", and "Get Closer" that reels them in 
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 This book isn't worth the money.  I bought it for my daughter who told me it was worthless.  I was upset at her attitude but then read it myself.  Sadly she was correct, if a bit ungrateful 
 this book has slowed down my guitar learning process enormously, basically because it took away the fun from playing. a guide that I would recommend to every beginner out there is found at http://guitar.about.com/library/blguitarlessonarchive.htm and is strangely enough free. 
 In the search and title it says Human Physiology: From cell to systems by Sherwood. It is not this is an study guide to accompany the textbook. Also when are reciever in the front page say clearly textbook not included. The name of this is Cram101 Textbook Outlines. I am very dissapointed because now I have to return this wait for my money back in the meanwhile order the texctbook elsewhere 
 When he talks about stuff I know he is so far off, misconstruing and mistating, that it makes me doubt his discussion of areas I know less about.  This is basically untestable philosophy, which you may like of not.  But it is way far from new, as any of us old 60s folks can recall.  To paraphrase an old article in psychology: what's true isn't new, and what's new isn't true.  Read some neuropsych instead 
 Boring, repetitious, snarky, unfocused, poorly edited, mistake-ridden, and next to unreadable.  The book is subtitled "The Black Death & the World it Made."  The (very) few points it made about the plague's effects on history and society--the reason I chose this book--were so deeply buried they almost slipped by me.   To say this book is poorly edited is to assume that an editor looked at it at all.  I wish I had the text electronically, though, so I could count how many times the author used the word "biomedical" (sometimes several times on one page.)  He also thinks microorganisms are "toxic" and that noisome means noisy.  The text is often internally inconsistant.  For example, in one place he explains that a plague sufferer can have internal abdominal buboes, and in another place says that the lack of external buboes means that another disease was responsible for some cases attributed to the Black Death. He refers to plague both by its scientific name Y. pestis, and by the outdated term pasteurelle (sic) pestis--in the same paragraph. In the bibliography section, he conflates (or confuses) biological weapons, banned by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in the 70s, with those banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which didn't enter into force until 1997.  He also takes a gratuitous swipe at the US government, implying the US only "claimed" to stop producing biological agents.   And plague caused by "cosmic dust" !!!?  Finally, the last chapter, Aftermath, does not sum up the book.  Unsurprisingly, it rambles.  There is quite a bit about Richard II, and the last two pages are inexplicably devoted exclusively to Chaucer.  I wish I had back the money I paid for this book.  I wish more that I had back the several hours I spent reading it 
 I'm not so sure about the integrity of the publisher of a book that serves an aid to the wallet but an adversary to the eyes of one who is not so accustomed to reading such an esoteric font 
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 Don't order this book from amazon unless you want to be told you will have to wait over a month for Amazon to deliver it.  Order it from Barnes and Noble and get it quicker 
 I did not find this book very useful.  I suppose I was looking for more of a book on Access and the application of relational databases.  I should have picked up "Grover Park George ON ACCESS" and avoided this one.  However, even if I only had only wanted to learn the basics of relational databases, I should not have bought this book.  It has about 25% of the substance that I would expect from a book of its length.  The author explains every little thing over and over, and explains why he's explaining things, then provides more examples than necessary.  To me, this book was an unfortunate waste of time 
 This is definitley Deborah Harrys worst solo album. It is overproduced, too slick and has no soul. Jocelyn Brown's backing vocals are also extremely out of place. The only decent track is the classic "French Kissin' In The USA", whilst the album version of "In Love With Love" is truly embarassing (the SAW version was by far superior!). I think Deborah has hit a bum note here. For a real masterpiece, buy her debut album "Koo Koo". Each track is a perfect gem 
 Myself, my peers, and my teaching assistant for my math class equally agree that this book isn't that great.  Topics have few examples, if none at all, and can be hard to follow. It only has one color ink, black; and with all the text so close together with nearly the same font and size it's hard to find key equations from previous chapters.  This may be the best book out there for advanced calculus, but it desperately needs to be revised and reorganized 
 Normally a huge Shannon Drake fan - this book dragged on.  Contrary to another reviewer I didn't start to enjoy the book until some familiar characters came back into play.  The main charcaters in this book did not have enough to carry this story on their own.  This was a big let down 
 I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.  For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:  TRY THIS ONE IF... - You have a very abundant milk supply - You only plan to pump one or twice a month - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period  INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... - You're going back to work - Your milk supply is medium to low - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)  Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one) 
 All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters 
 i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok. i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there. any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is. first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance. 
 Being a day late and a dollar short, I finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews.  I could not get past the introduction by Lestat (Anne) saying how stupid we all are for "not getting" his/her previous book".  She/he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get, to my satisfaction anyway. AND the religious aspect of it all...... well I will keep my own council on that issue.   My theory regarding Anne's later efforts is (please do not take offence Ms. Rice) that Anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died.  Could it be that he had some part (a large one)in her previous novels?  The beautiful prose is gone from her writing and I think as her writing deteriorated, her ego grew.   All I can say is - Anne, stop writing, retire, open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity. Kick back, bake cookies enjoy your life, just please do not torture us with any more writing.   
 I have started to program in windows and was hoping this book whould help me with it. Chould I be more wrong?  The wrighter sure know how to wright mutch about little, you can read 1 A4 without problems without even see any code, atleast thats what it fellt like. The only thing you actually can use this book to, are as a reference. But then you might consider to check out hte win32 api bible for windows 95 instead, dont bi chocked that it is for win95, it is no big difference and both use C ( not C++), the only difference are that they use cod as example, this guy doesnt 
 If looked as a parady of some other books it was some what  amusing. But very heavy handed 
 I don't like that amazon has pop up of Please Read To Me series in with Pictureback Readers and other formats.  They are all very different.  See Cranky Day review.  
 I did not like the book.  It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me.  I am more of a Love and Logic fan.  I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do.  I just don't agree with it 
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I bought one of these can openers today. The mounting screws stripped out even before I got it completely mounted. The screws thread into soft metal tabs instead of nuts, making it impossible to mount securely. I don't know if it would open a can, as I never got that far, but it looks difficult to locate the can properly. It's a piece of cheap Chinese made junk 
 The people rating this high must be paid to do so.  It's just riddled with historical inaccuracy ... Fuller's book on this topic is SO much better that I'm still kicking myself for buying this.    Just because I made the mistake doesn't mean you have to. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 SAY HELLO TO  queens of the stone age.personally i dont like bands as qotsa,but must admit that finch did an amazing job with plagiating many ideas from this band!!!!!!this record is tooooooooooo complex  and "unoriginal".rip,fnch.just another "one hit wonder" band 
 I smell a rat here. This book is obviously produced by someone who don't want the truth about the Roswell incident to come out 
 We should all be for Mr. Ravi Batri.  By selling enough copies of this book and its sequel ("Surviving the Great Depression of 1990"), he singlehandedly prevented worldwide economic collapse 
 Other than some quotes and perspectives to consider - nothing of new news or ah-ha's in the book. For someone looking to find ways to shake up the planning process - this book did not help muc 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 When I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.  Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.  There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.    However, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.  After a while, we began to think, "If Lonely Planet doesn't recommend it, it's probably interesting."  The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.  Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas.   There are much better guides available.  This entry has sworn me off the LP series for life.  
 At about a 5th grade reading level, this book does a decent job in explaining the basics of chemical reaction engineering.  Way too many typos in it, however, and that really annoys me.. 
 I found this book to be bland in the least.  It seemed to drag on forever, then when it finally did end it was so abrupt that you felt like the ending was an afterthought.  Not impressed at all 
 Total garbage for anyone interested in learning how to draw. I think another reviewer said you'd be better off getting pictures off the Internet and copying those. That's correct. This book is of no value whatsoever. A coloring book teaches you more 
 Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with 
 All I knew about MFK Fisher before reading this book was that she was a food writer.   This collection of essays portrays a self-absorbed, self-obsessed and self-indulgent silly woman of questionable character.  Since she is long-winded  and reveals sexual values likely considered loose during her time, it is only natural that she has been elevated to the faux status of fine American writer.   (I'm sure feminists love the fact that she walked out on her first husband, near as I can tell to avoid serving marshmallow salads to faculty wives, whom she apparently despised as beneath her intellectual superiority.)   I finished the book only because my contempt for the author kept me plodding through her essays.   This vain barfly thought she possessed divine insight, but I think it more likely that her insobriety prompted an abnormal amount of self-examination and reflection.   Her sentimental gushings reveal an egotistical, pompous, pretentious, shallow, and frivolous woman.   What astonished me is that she yammered on about suppers in France endlessly, but made only a passing reference to her second husband losing a leg and then his other three limbs prior to his death.   One would think this amount of tragedy and human suffering should command more discussion than a very good bowl of soup.  After reading the book, I read some bios of MFK Fisher's life, one of which mentioned her psychotherapist.  My insight into her personality proved accurate.   I'll think of her when I nuke TV dinners.  Celebrating life is not the same as celebrating oneself.   
 I thought reading this book was a waste of time. It largely preoccupied with its overdone sex-and-gender research and sometimes becomes downright obscure eg. when the writer of the first chapter was just interested in the way certain "scripts" he believes to exist can be or not be found in the dating stories of some boys he interviewed. What's sad about this chapter is that he ignores the obvious dilemmas some of them were in. One told him that he wanted to try out anal intercourse in a public restroom in order to "find his identity" or something. The author does not comment on this glaring misconception of what sexual orientation is and is not about (eg your personal identity) and how anal intercourse or other sex techniques might be wrongly linked with same-sex attraction or a contrived "gay identity". Anyone interested in this particular problem should read the papers and essays of Chuck Tarver and Billy Weintraub (both are available on-line)!  In another chapter its writer concludes that some gay men actually think they basically don't differ from straight men just because of their difference in sexual orientation. Now that's something that should be emphasised, but the whole collection of essays seems to be rather about how gay men are somehow special or different while straight men are all the good old emotionless blokes.  Another funny thing was when in a chapter its writer complained that there are some gay men who object to a link of feminism and the gay rights movement or try to prove they are not chauvinistic when she thinks they obviously are. I thought that made the whole intentions of her article clear.  The only good chapter was the last one: its author researched drag queens and concludes that the gay men who do that kind of cross-dressing don't do it to actually become a woman, but just as straight men might try to make fun of certain feminine role-models. That was an interesting read.  Still, the only book I can wholeheartedly recommend on this subject is Bawer's A Place at the Table 
 I ordered this book because I am extremely interested in the untold stories of the Partition of India even though the reviews told me not to.  I wished I had heeded the advice.  The book is incredibly repetitive--to the point of being unreadable. I learned very little.  Not worth the time to read or money to purchase.  
 I think I only liked one of her recipes.  The rest of them weren't original 
 My son is a Junior in High School and brought this 5th Edition book home last week.  I spent an hour going through this book and I have to tell you that I am disappointed in the content.  It lacks historical information and focuses on Social issues.  I want my son to know the historical information behind these social issues.    It is sad that so much of our history is no longer being taught in our schools in favor of diversity 
 Published by the Disney Corporation, not exactly an objective source for a biography of Walt Disney. You'll learn more about the man just wandering his parks and watching his films than you will from this extended press release, which completely ignores key individuals and events that helped shape Uncle Walt. The photos aren't very interesting either -- pass on this one. 
 For those of you put off by the negativity of most of the Amazon reviews of this book, let me suggest one concrete reason why this book is not worth your time. The story of the 2004 Red Sox was a story of great players. Certainly, Theo Epstein deserves much credit, but it was David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez and Keith Foulke and Bill Mueller and...on an on, and most definately Pedro Martinez. A tip off to the problem with the book is to look up Ramirez, Manny in the index. The dearth of references told me immediately that Shaughnessy had not gotten past his personal animosities. On the subject of Pedro, he is pathetic. There are no good stories like one would expect from an "insider account." Yet again we hear how huge the Varitek-Arod fight was. Yet again, he spews about Nomar. A few quotes here and there but mostly a glossy distant portrait by a writer who sounds deeply unhappy. If you followed the season as a fan, you won't learn anything you didn't already know. Stick with the videos until a better book comes alon 
 I work in finance and create many charts and graphs. I figured a book like this would help me to design them better. I was really looking for a practical guide rather than a long, rambling academic textbook, but that's how this book reads.   It seems aimed at college underclassmen rather than business professionals. Few spends page after page discussing the most basic mathematical concepts and things that you simply don't need to know in order to create a graph. For example, there is an entire chapter on basic statistics such as how to calculate a mean, median and mode. There is also a lengthy discussion of how the human eye works.  As I went through the book I found myself thinking: "Wow, Few has so little to say about tables and graphs that he needs all of this filler material to make this seem like a real book!"  There are some valuable chapters at the end of the book, but it takes a lot of patience to get there.  The page format is also really annoying and too textbook-like. It is a really wide book with citations (90% of which seemed to be from Tufte) in the wide margins.  I give this review one star for the 15 or so pages worth of good advice it contains. Unfortunately that wasn't enough content to warrant an entire textbook If you're a business professional looking for something you can use, this book is VASTLY overpriced and oversized.  My final comment is on the cover: An eye. A Brain. A sun. Bars coming out of each. It says very little to me, and that seemed to be the theme of the book. I wish I'd have seen a real review on this book before I shelled out $30.   
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 I can see Jessica doing something this lame, but Nick?  He's usually the level headed one who can tell when something is just lame.  But you see him up there dancing along with the choreography like a puppet.  It's kinda sad.  The Nightrider thing was embarrassing, and Jessica is a horrible actor.  The weirdest thing was when she sang with Jewel. She's a good singer, but looks absolutely ridiculous doing it.  You can actually see Jewel trying not to laugh.  The rest of the show was just bad jokes.  Like the baseball skit where Jessica hit someone in the audience (supposedly), that was the punchline?  Seriously?  Kinda ruins the Newlyweds series for me 
 After reading this book I have concluded Albert Gore is quite possibly the most arrogant politician since Richard Nixon. The country is lucky he was not president, hopefuly Bush will do better than previously predicted, allowing opportunities for true public servents rather than know it alls like Mr. Gore 
 I have to admit that I enjoy Arnold's movies and even like the ones that are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO UNREALISTIC like Commando. But, this one was absolutely horrid. The plot is lame, the action is lame, the suspense is lame, everything is lame. It was terrible! Arnold plays a firefighter bent on revenge after his son and wife are killed in an explosion. And of course, he kicks but. Anyway, I own this terrible movie and think about throwing it out of my window a lot. It's horrid! It's not interesting, boring, repetitive and there is no suspense. Oh my gosh! Is the terrorist attack going to work? Of course not because Arnold the firefighter will save the world! I hated this terrible movie 
 I regret to inform that Anne Rice has been reduced from an open minded author with original ideas, to a narrow minded christian.  This book will be interesting for: * those who have never read or heard about the time period Jesus grew up * christians and other book-religious people  Otherwise, nothing really interesting happens in this book. At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.  I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side. I give it 2 stars for the research work, 0 for the story.  Sorry, Anne Rice. I will still read your old book 
 Beware -- this unit does not work with Toshiba laptops.   Tech support is non-existent.   You will never get through on the phone.   Email support is non-existent.   You will have to wait weeks to hear back.    If it does work with your laptop, this unit does a great job of recording and playing.  
 One minute training is being based on max heart rate, the next it's based on your lactate threshold.  There are just too many contradictions throughout the book 
 I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal. I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing. BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature 
 The first CD in the package is a "Greatest Hits" CD.  The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it. Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it 
 These things are just getting worse. Why do I buy them?   The first hint should be that the back of the book names the main character as "Nick Hadley" and throughout the actual novel the main character's name is "Jeff Hadley". Is the publisher paying any bit of attention to these books?  The book is about a man who is stranded on an island after Oceanic Flight 815 crashes there. The characters names are the same. However that is where the simularity with the show of Lost ends. None of the characters act or talk like themselves and the author can't decide if the caves are somehow an evil place where no one goes or if some of the castaways live there.  There really should be a rule that if you write a Lost novel you need to actual watch the show. It's a popular show, how hard can it be to find a halfway decent author to write these things?  I don't recommend buying this book. The only reason why they can get away with such poor quality is because they stamp the word "Lost" on it and stupid fans like me buy it. Don't be like me 
 After using this case for a while, I found the top cover did not close properly as it did when I purchased it.  The top cover can either slip inside, or to the outside of the lip on the top left hand side of the case. I am referring to the small metal tab, that supports the case cover when closed, located to the left and above the Axim device lock button, when your Axim is in the case.  This poor fit causes the Axim to get squeezed a bit, at the point where the Axim microphone is.  The case is not properly designed to ensure that this pinching or squeezing does not occur.  The case also has no secure locking mechanism, to prevent the case from popping open if you should drop it.  This would potentially expose your Axim to screen damage 
 While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 I had a crush on a chick that liked this cd....then i found out how she was....hmmm oh yeah slut! anyway yeah garbage good thing i never considered buying or downloading any of her music....oops she did it again create a garbage. Oh and to add on for my not so well absent minded avril lavigne fan. "which sucks" she bought the cd and got spyware on her computer.....thanks again britney!!!  P.S: Another girls gone wild britney and madonna....lma 
 This is a scam.  For example, the most useful number he gives is 202-555-1212 YES! that's general information for D.C.  Please, do not buy this book......it is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book is published by the organization which also produces the NA Bird field guide considered "best" by most avid birders, the National Geographic Field Guide (Geo guide for short).  However it is absolutely NOTHING like said field guide!  It is very small (6 inches by 4 inches) and consists entirely of full page color photographs on the left page, and brief descriptive text with a Texas-only range map on the right page.  At the bottom of the text page are even more brief notes, usually about another similar bird, and often accompanied by a tiny painting of that bird (which appears to be taken directly from the Geo Guide).  The photographs are quite good, and really are the only saving grace of the entire book.  They appear to be chosen for their artistic value more so than to illustrate field marks, however.  The selection of species is extremely superficial - for example, the only species of oriole shown is Bullock's Oriole, despite the fact that in west Texas Scott's Oriole is routinely found, and for birders in the lower Rio Grande valley the target species is likely to be Altamira Oriole (not pictured), or, if coverage was as exceptional as I had hoped an NGS bird publication would be, even Audubon's or Black-vented Oriole - and one also wonders why Orchard Oriole, found throughout the state, is left out!  The book description here on Amazon is "generous" in its pronouncements.  The "guidance on where to look for key birds" consists of a one-page, incredibly simplistic commentary on birding in Texas ("The Texas coast is well-known as a place for migrant birds to rest and feed on their way northward."  "Other regions of the state include the High Plains where Lesser Prairie-Chickens still strut . . .")  Turn the page and the most specific location data provided is a map of the entire state with numerous parks and refuges depicted.  But it is left entirely up to you to figure out how to navigate to Anahuac NWR to look for those migrants (where's High Island?), and, since Lesser Prairie-Chicken isn't even included in the main text, how are you supposed to know that Muleshoe NWR might be a place to try to see them?  My greatest hope for this book was that it would give additional insight into the Texas specialities of ABA area birding, but even here it is basically incomplete.  Plain Chachalaca, Least Grebe, White-tailed Hawk, Crested Caracara, Common Paraque, Buff-bellied Hummingbird, Ringed Kingfisher, Great Kiskadee, Black-capped Vireo, Green Jay, Colima and Golden-cheeked Warbler, and Olive Sparrow are all here, but missing are a few regular species which make Texas birding so unique, such as Groove-billed Ani and White-collared Seedeater.  Since only in south Texas can a Muscovy Duck be counted (as opposed to being labelled an escapee from you local park's pond), why not show a wild Muscovy instead of another photo of a wild Mallard?  And what about every birder's favorite dump denizen, the Tamaulipas Crow?  Overall this book is not recommended, at any level of birding, for any use other than its collection of photographs.  For a beginner in the field (or even in the backyard) it doesn't provide the necessary comparison images to differentiate even the most obvious field marks so as to allow identification.  For the intermediate birder trying to locate target species in Texas, the guidance (or essential lack thereof) to places where the birds can be found is woeful.  And for advanced birders - well, they really don't need something this small in size or detail.  Be aware that there are several other titles in this series, for other states, and I suspect that this review's basic criticisms hold for all of them.  As for me, I'll hold on until November when the Fifth Edition of the REAL Geo Guide comes out 
 It's a good thing I watched the movie before reading  the book or else I wouldn't have known what the heck was going. I was stranded at a bus station in Philly and "Beloved" was the only book I had to read to pass away the time. Dull, dull, dull. Torture, torture, toture. I had to re-read each page more than once just to understand what was happening. This book is too long, too boring, and extremely overhyped. It leaves you braindead. I enjoyed "The Bluest Eye" more than this. Skip this book at all costs and watch the movie instead. The movie's just as boring and confusing, but it's visual and last only 2 hours and 52 mintues, which is less time than a week of reading 
 i ordered this release last week from amazon and couldn't wait to hear it, but when i got it yesterday, i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd, instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised, i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads!  oh, my lord, what in the world happened!?  well, i guess you can't hear 'em all, can ya?  i'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time.  oh, by the way, the one star is not for the flirts music, for that is 5 star material anyway, but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music 
 I kept hoping and hoping this book would get better, but it didn't. The threat to the Scoobies was not intriguing, the characters, while not terribly written were also not at their most accurate, and the ending was quite anticlimactic. I found myself skimming most of this dull novel. Only read if you're a huge Buffy fan, and do not make this your first Buffy novel 
 I read the blurbs from other writers, some I really enjoy, like Jeff Vandermeer, and was excited about this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  A lot of the writing is very good, but a lot of it is just terribly over-written.  The opening was strong, with the two main characters fleeing across a desert, but once they reach the city of Ashamoil, things deteriorate.  There is only really one sympathetic character, and I expected her to be the main character; she isn't.  Instead, it's the other of the two from the opening.  He is gradually revealed to be a vile person, and frankly, just not very interesting.  There are echoes of China Mieville and Jeff Vandermeer and M. John Harrison...maybe even a little Fritz Leiber.  But while I would love to visit cities like New Crobuzon or Ambergris or Viriconium or Lankhmar, I have no desire to visit (or revisit) Ashamoil, despite its vivid depiction 
 I was excited when I purchased this ear thermometer because I had an ear thermometer years ago that I loved. I was unfortunately very disappointed with this one's performance. The temperature seemed innaccurate when we were testing it right after purchase. Then about two weeks ago my daughter came down with a fever. I could feel that she was burning up, but the ear thermometer read 97.5 when I checked it (twice). I got out the oral thermometer and discovered her fever was actually 102.1!!!       Needless to say this thermometer went back to the store. I won't buy another ear thermometer until I can afford to get a better brand, like the one I had years ago (ThermoScan). :o 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.  I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.  I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.   
 Farai chideya grapples unsuccesfully about racism in her latest book. She claims that racism is not a black and white issue, however throughout the book she repeatedly comes back to sole black and white issues. She has her  concepts right- education and experiencing racism can help rid society of  this maggot that is racism- however she does not illustrate these theories  in the stories she has gathered from traveling cross country. She does not  go in enough depth for any of the mini-biographies from the people she  interviews to have any impact. She also writes that teenagers are the  future of racism, and that it is up to us to determine what role racism  will play in the next century, however she does not offer any realistic  ideas and suggestions on how to go about educating people. while the  concept of this book is a positive one, the resulting take on the book is  negative. The color of our future leaves you with an unpleasant aftertaste  in your mind, people are better off reading another UN-BIASED book to  educate themselves about racism 
 We would like to send this item back.  The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome.  One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled.  The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble 
 This woman put 23,000 people out of work. Poor thing, she got fired, received a huge severance and a book deal. Now all she can think about is herself and how bad they did her. I fell asleep reading it. 
 Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Luke Wilson) reunite to recover the Imperial Seal of China and avenge the death of Chon's father, the Keeper of the Seal.  They are joined by Chon's sister, the beautiful and equally dangerous Lin (Fann Wong).  The chemistry of Wilson and Chan is as delightful as ever, but that (and the beautiful and talented Wong) is about the only reason to watch this tired comedy.  Even the action scenes are uninspired.  A disappointment 
 the premise was great, a really nice idea for a book.  there were a few interesting statistics in the book, but overall i found the book pointless and rambling.  i'm still not sure what i was supposed to have taken from it.  was there a point?    i agree wholeheartedly with a previous poster who wondered about eisenberg's definition of "middle class".  despite a couple of charts breaking assets and earnings up by quintile, his anecdotes and stories clearly predominantly focused on the top fifth or top tenth of americans.  
 ....This new one is not really an encyclopedia. Instead ofcompletely alphabetical it is alphabetical by subject, i.e.,chemistry, botony, etc., and made topics very hard to find.  The 2000version also left out definitions/explanations.... I don'trecommend the 2000 version at all.  Sorry.  As usual the second remakeof something never seems to be as good as the first.  EN 
 This book should never have been re-released.  It is that bad.  Save your time, money, and vision.  None of the characters are believable or likeable.  Meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to Billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  I have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an MBA.  Not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.    Cy is totally appalling.  Why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   And yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  How stupid.  How could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  How could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  And what about the mysterious Mr. Smith?  Although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  He could have been interesting.  Wasn't he worth a story line?  He did not even rate a first name.  Unbelievable.  This book was too, painfully long with characters I never cared about.  It was torture to read.  Even the sex was bad.  For people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  Put this one back in mothballs.  And Diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  Love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35 
 This franchise is for fools like all of you who buy it and give it five stars. The songs on this Cd are the reasons of fools who listen to them. Plus, Kelly Clarkson should be lying in a pool of her own blood by now. Music like this is what deserves to die. This franchise will be destroyed by fire and blood, and then the music world will be safe.  Did you think that the song of "Since You've been gone is so good that kids would listen to it? It is music that strikes fear and terror that does the trick. Did you even think that the song of "Incomplete" would be great for kids as well that they should listen to it? I have enough power, that I would use it to destroy the Kids Bop Franchise, and the fools who listen to them. I will create a reign of terror that will destroy MTV, American Idol, Kids Bop, and yes, put the music world under my total control.   To the fools who buy this franchise, as well as the fools who make this franchise.  You are against me. You have tried to rob me of bliss and nourishment, but I have eaten in spite of you, and slept in spite of you. I hereby promote the music duos known as Nox Arcana, and Midnight Syndicate in my reign of terror. There has been one execution, by nightfall there shall be another. For what you did to music by releasing this franchise will never be forgiven. You may lock yourselves away, surround yourselves with security guards, but death is coming. You want music? Nox Arcana and Midnight Syndicate are the forces of music that will rule the radio and television airwaves 
 I bought this book to help me plan the space for a home theater I am planning to build myself.    Big mistake.   It contained nothing useful for me.  This is a book written by someone who only knows home theater from the perspective of rich or trendy clients who pay big bucks to have someone else do all the planning.   It's also something of a advertising piece to show off very big and expensive (nothing under six figures) home theaters designed by two firms the author repeatedly gives credits to.  At the very end she even has a brief interview with the head of one of those firms.     If you're really rolling in the dough and want to see lots of  glossy pictures to see how to spend your money, this book is for you.  Example: "John and Jane have a wonderful theater space with arched alcoves along the walls.   They display their collection of antique vases in each alcove, and use accent lighting to enhance it.   They install a crystal chandelier for ambient lighting..."  For everyone else it's a waste of time.   It's so limited in text that it didn't take more than a couple hours to read through.  Instead of giving you some real planning guides, the author limits herself to glosses of the obvious along with references to the type of professional you'll need to hire (so many - I've never heard of an acoustician before.   He came somewhere after the cabinetmaker you'll need to design the housing for the projector).  This is a book that bows to wealth and trendiness.   For those of us who want to tap our own creative ability as well as our more typical budget, we'll have to look elsewhere for inspiration and information.  
 Will Young, the guy who fooled the voters into the fact that he had a girl all the way through the competition and then announced he was gay.  The singing is alright.  But I prefer a musican who is more thruthful than this guy 
 DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!  This book was a disappointment. It promises insight into why Black men choose White women and does not deliver. Instead of empirical evidence,the book presents myths, stereotypes of both races with pieces of historical facts. For example an entire chapter is based on the Willie Lynch letter. A letter that has never been authendicated, yet it is presented as empirical evidence to explain the hostility between Black males and females.   According to the text the mental abuse and the destruction of Black marriages and family structure during slavery accounts for the low self esteem within the African American community(29-36). It is true that slavery destroyed many Black families and marriages. The problem is the book places the blame for the break down of  contemporary Black marriages and families solely on the application of the Willie Lynch letter. The book does not take into account contemporary economic and social conditions that affect Black marriages and families.  Sexually the African American male and African American female are not compatible. This is due to religious training,playing games-hard to get-and because of the legacy of rape by the White man. It prevents her from opening up emotionally to her husband emotionally and sexually. The Afican American male having failed at other areas seeks to dominate the female in the bedroom. Sexual contact is the last expression of true power and release  of frustrations derived from his own ill treatment. Therefore the book states Black men choose white women because the man does not want to play games and the Whgite woman is submissive to his will(chapters 5-8).  One thing the book does is offer herbal medicines to combate high blood pressure, E.D.(erectal dysfunction) and encourages the African American community to take better care of their health and not depend totally on prescribed medication(pg.59).    In the end the book is a disappointment concluding that Black men choose White women because they have brought into various stereotypes. Stereotypes like the White woman is the sole picture of beauty and African American female is unattractive and is a golddigger(chapter 9-10). This book was a disappointment. It promises insight into why Black men choose White women and does not deliver. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!    
 The product is great, calling tech support is a task though. Intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone. If this product wasn't preffered by my CPA I would never buy it ever again. Boycott companies that outsource to other countries, keep our jobs at home! 
 Poorly written, boring - I got to about page 30 and gave up. Too many GOOD books, too little time. Someone PLEASE tell me how this boring piece of tripe got published 
 I made the mistake in buying this book. I thought it was about Filipino Martial Arts....it's about how a supposedly avid practitioner of the FMA keeps refering to Japanese and Indonesian arts trying to lump everything and anything under FMA.  It's really sad because these so called 10th degree grandmasters let these guys crap all over Filipino Martial Arts and get away with it.  It's not Japanese or Indonesian..it's Filipino....The author wrote a book with nothing but his own opinion...he probably never been to the Philippines.       Sorry but Sarongs and Kerambits are not Filipino...Guys need a reality check.  Stop bastardizing the art!  I'm sorry I bought this book and I'm sad that this is how some Filipinos are teaching the art just to make everybody happy and to fatten their wallets 
    This book is not really a commentary but an explanation of Tim LaHaye's view of the end times which is not thorough and leaves tons of holes. The whole Rapture movement is based on almost no Biblical grounds but is popular just because it makes for exciting books. For a thorough, well-researched, understandable, and Biblically sound commentary on Revelation, pick up Herman Hoeksema's outstanding work, Behold, He Cometh! 
 John Barnes can do better. Rambling plot threads, links to concepts in previous books not explained for a new reader to this series. I was unable to connect to the characters, and thus finally gave up at page 200 (out of 400) after many attempts to pick it up again, threw on the fire. Sorry Joh 
 I was 17 when this film came out. My girlfriend and I had just invented sex. We were enthusiastic about our invention. After sitting through this movie, we didn't have sex for more than a week. We were seventeen years old, had access to a sex partner and didn't have sex for a week!  Pretty typical Warhol/Morrissey stuff: Self hatred, guilt, shame and money. How these people got tagged as the avant-garde is beyond me. Warhol and Morrissey were reactionaries through and through.   I gave it two stars because it is sort of 'interesting' if you've never known people like the characters. They're around. If you're watching the movie to look at Joe D'allesandro, I won't hold that against you. 
 I purchased a Brita after being a devout pitcher system user for years. I'd had a faucet system from Pur a few years back and it leaked. I was hesitant to go the faucet route again. I figured I'd pay extra for this most expensive Brita model, assuming mechanical integrity.  Here's my overview:  The installation (to the sink) was easy. The unit has not leaked at all. This is great.  The filter installation is easy. The battery installation was also easy.  I have owned the system for 4 months and replaced 2 filters. The Aquaview display in BJs shows a clearly worn filter needing replacement. This worn filter is shown through the Aquaview window. My own filters look as clean as the day I installed them at the point when the unit indicates yellow and red LED lights. This , by Brita's own definition, is when you replace your filter.  The cost of these filters is $25 a whack. I would not mind this price if I felt the filter's proverbial time was up. I'm feeling that I'm replacing good filters. I taste test the water each day. The tap water defintely tastes worse than the Brita water. Noticeable. This gives me confidence the unit is working. The Aquaview feature is supposed to be away to say--Hey look my filter is really dirty, it's capturing the contaminants I'd drink. My town's water is dirty. If you leave sheets wet in the washer, you will get a brown tinge.   Why are my filters clean in the Brita unit after two months. The LED says change the filter (RED Light). The aquaview shows me a clean filter to the naked eye. The price of use for these filters is $150 per year, with this red light going off every two months like a clock alarm. Brita is there a chance that the filter is still good, even with your LED light on? Can you let consumers in on this? I realize many contaminants may not make your filter elements dirty, but then why make something called an Aquaview filter, if the view shows  a clean filter and I'm throwing away a clean filter.   So fellow consumers, beware! The proof is not in the pudding. Taste alone does not insure that harmful contaminants are not reaching me---this means the system may not be working even on week one. The LED light system, at least in my household, does not correlate even slightly with the naked eye  Aquaview condition. My filters look like they could go another month or two without dirtying. This may be testimony to a really good filter. The taste test does not correlate with the Red Light. The water, even with a replace indicator, and a clean view indicator, still tastes better than tap and equivalent to the filter being a day or two old. I would say my filter is still good and Brita has me over replacing good filters but we're dealing with the world of microbial contaminants---who are they to go liberal on filter conservation. On the other hand it's a big hit to consumers and environment to be throwing these units away good.  So.......beware on this machine. You will probably, even with a dirty view, find yourself replacing filters sooner than the manufacturer describes. You may find yourself like me and  another reviewer on this site, with LED lights going off and filters not looking dirty. I am curious about the New Jersey person who claims they have not changed it yet, seemed like about 6 months. This is disconcerting because the LED light is a timer or volume control and would go off regardless of your Aquaview filters visual condition. 6 months on a filter seems too long though and I'd conjecture you're getting some bad stuff in your tap.  Brita please provide much greater detail on your website (which doesn't work tonight for registration or support email.  Regards 
 This watch looks so real, my grandson was thrilled. However there is no way to view the images on the disc that come with the watch (or the Ben 10 character toys) because the watch is not back lit.    
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 Mr Heinrich is touted on the inside back cover as a scientist. Maybe so, but he didn't bring much science to bear on this book. It is a thinly disguised peon to Barry Sears' work on the Zone, with a lot of personal  anecdote and opinion thrown in. The bibliography is telliing - too many  popular articles and not too much science. I have nothing against Sears'  work - in fact I'm a fan - but this adds nothing to the genre. And boy did  I get sick of the phrase 'pasta, pasta, pasta' 
 I'm not impressed with this book.  It was written quite a while ago.  It's not as true to life as most of Heinlein's work... this is just low-brow work for him...  Don't read it.  It's not worth your time 
 This book should be named "Beginners Broad Overview of Mac OSX Programming Topics".  If you have never even heard of Bash/C/Python/Perl/OOP/Cocoa/Frameworks - this book may be of some use.    The first few chapters on Interface Builder/Xcode have you follow along with the simplest of instructions, creating Projects, and working with .c and .h files, and then into building and running a few simple applications. These high level concepts in themselves quite easy to grasp but the descent into actual cocoa programming/c language/frameworks/OOP in succeeding chapters is quite difficult and the authors take the same tone as many other 'how-to' books do in remaining quite technical about technically abstract concepts.   Here you will find the going quite rough, and the 'why' factor (eg, why are we doing this) is definitively absent. I can see why I have a .c file but why do I need a .h file ? The mind's natural intuition is to say "why *ever* make things more complicated then they need to be.... so why not combine the content of .c and .h files together ? The mind wonders "did the programming guru's who created XCode/IB/Cocoa/C/OOP just create a huge mess (cause thats what this looks like), or did they formulate something elegant ?" How did they arrive at this overtly complicated scheme ? Why does it have to be so complicated just to multiply a few numbers together in a small window (the Calculator tutorial from ADC).  One doesnt know when one is just starting out. There's no answer from the authors in these first few chapters, if ever. Perhaps there was some temerity at commenting 'in the margins'. This small example of a 'hey why are we doing that now ?' mental query, natural to process of learning, is just but one of many opportunities missed. Granted, nobody said programming was easy, but imparting an understanding being the ostensible goal of how-to books, the audience is definitely looking for clues about 'why' and not just the 'how'.  As a result of so many omissions, grasping the 'why' of it all is decidedly difficult. The book if it were to be improved would need to dig into this 'why' aspect much more deeply than it now does. Am I learning a big huge mess, that nobody has ever bothered to truly rethink/streamline or does this XCode/IB/Cocoa stuff combine into something truly efficient ? If its efficient, show me why, Im here to learn and want to know...  The languages chapters do a reasonable job of explaining to the never-heard-of-it-before audience the concepts of Bash, C, Perl, Python, and Applescript. The book provides decent examples and discussions as to their various capabilities and pro's and con's. The book also provides many "now you do it" type functions and you will find yourself wanting to launch a Terminal session and get going right away.  The book does not necessarily bode well for the programming novice at "rung 2 or 3" who already has some knowledge of broad topics and wants to actually learn the how-to of programming- which would quite naturally be Cocoa, since Cocoa is the basis for all modern Mac programs that run with any GUI at final output. Unfortunately,  I could only weakly recommend OReilly's "Learning Cocoa", itself quite technical and also very much missing the 'guide voice' or 'why factor'.   Because I feel the 'why factor' and the 'voice of the guide' were so notably absent from this tome, Im only giving it 2 of 5 stars, there's lots of room for improvement imho. I also despise when authors provide aliases to explanations found on the internet...and this tome is also guilty of this phenomena. Hey, I paid for your book, *I expect a decent explanation* not a link to a website where I could read with little understanding until my eyeballs fall out 
 I have never received this product.  It has been sent to me in 4 separate shipments over the past 3 months and has never arrived.  Tracking the items indicates that the USPS receives it damaged and returns it to Amazon.  It's been very disappointing, inasmuch as I asked my friends to give me Amazon gift certificates for my birthday, so that I could buy it from Amazon.  It's now carried by Target, and I could buy it there, but Amazon won't turn my gift certificates into cash, so that I could use the cash to buy the items instead of waiting for it to arrive at my local post office damaged again.  I have re-ordered using my gift using my certificates again.  Let's keep our fingers crossed 
 I bought a pair of these at Target last week and went to install them in my PUR branded Water Cooler (made by Kaz, Inc. under license).  Well after installing the new filters the first thing I noticed is that the orange filter life indicator at the top of the unit was gone.  I looked in the box, and there is now a sticker that, long story short, is just there to remind you to buy new filters in 2 months.  Okay, while that may work for the faucet mounted kind (which I also have) I was not happy about that.  But the worst was yet to come. . .  When I placed the water tank on top of the filters (which is what you do with the PUR water coolers) I couldn't get the tank to sit on top and dispense the water properly.  The new filters stick up about 1" or so higher than the old design.  Could I have installed them wrong somehow?  Nope.  THE IDIOTS AT PUR DIDN'T BOTHER TO NOTICE THIS REDESIGN OF THE FILTERS MADE THEM INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR OWN WATER COOLERS!!!    Needless to say, the tank fell of the top of my cooler, cracking and then spilling water all over the floor - and worse, making me now in need of a new water tank.  I called PUR.  They were closed.  Called the next day and spoke with a lady who I swear knew very little english.  I explained the problem and I think she tried telling me that she had seen a memo about this, and the solution was to send out 2 complimentary filters (presumably with the old design.)  She also instructed me to return the 2 new filters I just installed back to the store (in this case Target, who I'm sure is going to think I'm just bringing back my old, used filters.)    This still doesn't address the issue of the broken water tank,  which means I also need to call Kaz and explain and hope they send a new one (which they won't, as it's now out of warranty since I've had it for about a year and hey - look - they are now discontinued.)  BUYER BEWARE

 Benyus' degree is in natural resource management and all her previous work has been with wildlife.  She isn't qualified to write about many of the topics in this book.  At one point she attempts to describe things like the conversion of sunglight energy into ATP in plants and obviously she doesn't understand it so the reader understands even less.  Additionally she admits to not understanding and not trusting gene transfection.  How can you write about something that you don't understand and don't trust?  I was halfway through the book when she started getting stuff wrong about molecular biology (my specialty).  At that point I asked myself how much other stuff did she get wrong that I didn't catch?  Finally, the author spent too long talking about the scientists and places she visited.  How nice they were, what their labs look like, how much wheat is growing outside, and in general a lot of fluff that does little to excite someone about the science.    That aside I have to agree with another review who said this would have been a great book in the hands of a different author.  There are a lot of great ideas in here but they're not hers; they're the scientists' and they should have collectively written the book instead 
 If you're a fan of this series, do yourself a favor and re-read Life Its Own Self.  I started Rude Behavior for the third time and ground my way through because I was DETERMINED to see what had happened to Billy Clyde 'n them.  Now I want back the hours of my life I spent reading it.  It's at least 100 pages too long.  The idea for the plot is good, (Big Ed and Billy Clyde buy and manage an NFL expansion team) but between the wooden dialogue, the two-dimensional characters, the anti-PC fulminations that even I tired of, and the lines recycled from other novels, the finished product is awful.  The only thing that saves this review from getting one star are the occasional original Jenkins-ism, like what he has Jim Tom Pinch say to the Golden Domer out in Hollywood 
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began.  However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life.  The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not.  Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time 
 As far as acting, story line, directing, casting, and sexiness, it's a dud. Another ultra-hyped mediocrity. Enjoyable to a degree for just how incomprehensible it is 
 I was very excited to see this one. It looked really scary in the previews, but when I watched it I thought it was confusing at times. There are some scary parts in the movie but it is one that I would not watch again. 
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 Like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub-par music to a new generation of viewers.  The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line.  The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000.  The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie.  To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for.  My advice?  Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead 
 If current readers want some sense of how academic writing can serve the interests of those who have and want to hold onto power, they should read this book.  They can take it as a fine example of how government and their intellectuals produce stories to support their own positions and find in them the words and language they need to justify and 'explain' their actions.  Kagan's enormous attack on John Kennedy (nicely refuted in recent writings on JFK) aims to shatter the idea that there are other ways of dealing with power than those recommended by the chicken-hawklets in the Bush administration.  Also, there are other things to say about Thucydides than those Kagan chooses as essential to understanding war and the preparation to 'deter' it.  Surely readers notice how often Kagan offers accounts of 'pre-emptive' wars 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 I have taught mythology at the university level at various insitutions for the more than a decade now.  Indeed, when I first began was when the first edition of Powell came out.  At that time it was quite useful as his prose is modestly engaging, and the large swathes of original material and the occasional illustrations he includes is quite useful.    However, as he has progressed through four editions and doubled his price (!), he has become less useful.  To his credit, the online materials are good for the novice, and, as I previously mentioned, there is a fair amount of translated primary text.  However, his deficits now outweigh his benefits.  When Powell summarizes plots of texts in the middle of a longer excerpt, often his interpretation of events occludes what actually happens.  As he has progressed through various editions, his own ideas are now more confident in his eyes and some of his more controvertial claims which in the first edition were presented as "some scholars believe [historical situation] may have contributed to [textual effect]" are now presented as "[historical situation] caused [textual effect]."  As another reader notes, some of his historical contextualizations are either suspect or absent.  Lastly, the cost is prohibitive.    Now that I have learned a fifth edition is soon to be out and my students will no longer be able to purchase used copies, I have declined to order his book for this fall and don't foresee returning to him in the future 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 Man what happen to Eminem. He just droped the ball on this album. Wack lyrics and weak beats is what sums this album up. I never thought Eminem was the greatest rapper(MTV veiwers say that) but he had good songs.  Eminem always has that funny or catchy single like The Real Slim Shady or Without Me, but Just Loose It was a terrible song. It looks like Eminem just didn't have anything else to write about. The Marshell Matthers LP and the Eminem Show were good albums. Not classic albums but they had some good beats and good lyrics. The Slim Shady LP had good Beats but some bad lyrics except for Guilty Conscience and Bad Meets Evil. But thats his debut album so whats Eminem's excusse for putting this trash out. Puke, My First Single, Rain Man, and Big Wennie are stupid and annoying songs. The beats in this album also are weak. I don't know how much Dre had some input but this isn't Dre's best work. Dr. Dre needs to slap eminem for putting this album out. It gives Dre a bad name and Aftermath. I only liked two songs on this album. Never Enough featuring Nate Dogg and 50 Cent was pretty good, and Encore Feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent was good but not great. Eminem do yourslelf a favor. Listen to your old albums, have Dre do all the production and you do nothing but rap. Don't have anything else to write, than let Dre write your lyrics. Sorry but this album dosn't deserve 5 stars. It dosn't even deserve 1 star but that's the lowest I can go 
 First let me start on a positive note: acting is superb.  Story? Not much of a story. I could not believe review on the back of DVD--something about dramatic twist at the end. Give me a brake! Half of a movie shows us how her life is really so average, just going around, doing her chores, work and family--boooring! Here and there it shows how she "help" women who are pregnant to abort. At the end she gets arrested and goes to jail. That's a whole story. No dramatic twist, no character development, no historical backdrop that would tell us something about views of the time--this one is a big miss, because movie might have been more interesting if introduced views of politicians, church, judges, average women. If you have 2 hours to spare, you might put your feet up and stare at the blank wall-time better spent. 
 He gave it all he had, but there just wasn't much of interest there.  He's a self-described, turmoiled loser, and not very interesting one to boot.  Kafka, Roth, and Jeremy Leven (Satan, et al), write about similar troubled Jews, and are much funnier and interesting. I like his honesty, but, it's not worth the price of admission 
 When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.  Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind" 
 Locking your parents in the basement just to work out their marrage problems what a joke! I think my parents would be so incredibly pissed off and would kill me if I ever locked em in the basement like that with no food and treating them like they are prisoners you don't do that to your family if they want a divorce and move on with their lives that's their business. You can't change people like that it just doesn't work. this use to come on all the time on HBO and HBO is a huge waste of money nothing but worthless re run crappy movies on all the time. I give this crap 0 stars it sucked 
 I bought this book 2 months ago and I am still kicking myself for spending the money. I found this book to be condescending, preachy and at times, down right irratating. I was looking for practical, sensible tips on how to live my life in a more frugal and environmentally friendly manner.  All I got from this book was pie-in-the-sky, warm and fuzzy, painfully trite prose.  It became increasingly obvious as I forced myself to plow through this book, page by sappy page, that McBride spent far too much time researching quotes as headers for her chapters.  Had she spent anywhere near as much time writing about tried and true, honest to goodness money saving tips and techniques,  this book would not be such a waste.  To anyone considering this purchase, check it out of the library first to see if you like it, I sure wish I had 
 A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far 
 I was looking forward to reading this book (as a former trackie). Unfortunately, the "interviews" appear to be unedited, with repetition and typo's abounding. Very little coherent material. 
 I have never been one to go with reviews so I ignored the ones that I had read about the bike tipping over and bought it anyway for my 2 year old's birthday. What a mistake! Within 5 seconds of getting on the bike, it tipped over and did so every 2-3 minutes thereafter. Definitely not a safe bike. It may be cute and smaller than some of the others out there, but you'd be better off buying a kettler. Frome now on I'm going to pay more attention to the reviews. What a disappointment 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 I ordered the regular size, they were to big, the smaller size? too small. neither one fit well but both did one thing well, hurt the area under my eyes. Buyer BEWARE 
 In the item notes for this DVD it claims it is remastered. Though it is not as poor quality as the 2004 DVD, it still has black dots and white scratches in the picture. Is CBS the only place you can find the completely remastered version? This is NOT worth $14.99, more like $4.99. Remaster the thing or don't supply it. : 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it 
 I just could not get into this book. After several attempts to read I had to finally say that I just did not feel that the characters had enough depth to be enticing. However, I sure was captured by the cover 
 I learned quite a few interesting things about life from this movie.  This movie seemed to have quite a lot of plot holes.  Anyway, here is what I learnt about the world from this movie -   1) The yakuza (they play the bad guys in this movie) have nothing better to do than race cars.  2) If you are a car racer, you will never have to do jail time for any crimes you commit.   3) If you cannot drive at top speed and make hairpin turns through a car park without crashing into something, you are a loser.  4) Only gorgeous girls and guys with perfect bodies can drift.  5) Everyone in the school is either rich, gorgeous or a gangster.  6) It is perfectly okay to offer your car to a total stranger in a race - just to see what he's made of.  7) Even if you get in a race containing three cars and drive at top speed through a full city, and end up killing someone, then the police will do nothing about it.  8) If you are beautiful and blonde, it is a good idea to offer yourself up as the prize for a race, so your boyfriend gets involved in a race with another guy and almost kills all three of you.  9) It is an even better idea to scream at your boyfriend that he doesn't love you when he is neck-and-neck with another car, so that he rams into the other car on purpose.  10) If you walk away from a fight, you are a loser.  
 I am constantly amazed at what can get published.  The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality.  In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody.  The characters are not believable at all.  The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie.  Um right.  And I am the queen of Spain.  This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one.  I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid.  Almost too embarassed to donate this book.  I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this 
 I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times. 
 After waiting so long to see some of these great films in widescreen DVD, it is a major disappointment to see the quality of the transfers in this collection. As another reviewer has noted, Naked Spur is not good and Cheyenne Social Club looks like the entire film was transferred out of focus. Low bit rate to make two features fit on the (two sided) DVD? Who knows. Hard to believe the source material is marred in this way. I bought the collection; Cheyenne and Firecreek are available on their own as a two-disc set that may or may not be better. I've seen Warner features 30 years older that look much better. Shame on you Time Warner 
 Watch the mini series, skip the book.  If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.  The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was "dripped" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.  Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book 
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 I was confused by the range of reviews for this item, so I went and checked it out at a local bookstore before I ordered.  I'm really glad I did.   This book is clearly drawn by, and for, the people who think Star Wars films are great because they have lots of chases and fight scenes and techo-gadgetry. The woman who comments on what was left out of this "Complete" Guide strikes a note with me.  I'm a guy, but a guy who loves Star Wars for its archaeological richness and mythical roots.  The buildings which really interested me in the movies were the ceremonial ones, not the mechanic's shops.  I can't believe that the Galaxies Opera House was left out completely and that only the hangar of Naboo's royal palace was drawn. That said, I still found things to interest me.  Jabba's palace was well covered, and the illustrators showed a Wookie tree, which didn't really enter the films much at all except as background shots.  The podrace stadium and Geonosis battle arena included areas of sociological quirkiness.  Mostly, though, my eyes glazed at the minute details of hyperdrive cores and droid factories 
 I bought this battery as a replacement for an old Canon BP511A.  It lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge.  Complete waste of money 
  Your only option is to get this album. Tears of joy will stream down your face when you listen to this masterpiece. The lyrics are rich and full of meaning that any everyday person can relate to. You will fall to your knees listening to this, and you'll thank God for letting you purchase it. Go out and buy it now, you won't regret it. The lyrics, instrumentation... everything about this album, and this band in general, is brilliant.        OH! I thought I was reviewing an album from Pink Floyd! Not an album from a talentless, manufactured boyband! Avoid N*Sync like they were a plauge, and get the latest album from the Rolling Stones instead. Oh, and make sure you don't listen to that retard Banned And Censored, his mother was drinking while she was pregnet with him 
 I guess if you love country this cd is ok, but for those of us that came to Dolly durning her "9 To 5" peroid..this is really horriable music. Sorry dolly....I sold it back to the stor 
      This book has some interesting hypotheses but I don't believe it makes the case for the "Rape is the Last-Resort Reproductive Strategy" hypothesis as well as the Ghiglieri book does.  It is known that rape is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, or something resembling mating by forceful coercion at any rate.  I expected to see more of that kind of discussion than just a bunch of old statistics regarding us boring old homo sapiens.  Keep in mind, though, that among humans the majority of rapists are men in their sexually peak years, and the majority of victims are those women in their peak reproductive stages as well.  Sure, there are super-psychos that rape old women, kids or men, for example, but the mere existance of those datapoints do nothing to blunt the force of the evidence in favor of the theory that rape is the last-resort reproductive strategy.  In fact, it is well-known that the majority of rapes that occur: a) are date rapes! and b) an overwhelming number of the victims tend to be college aged women!  Also, let me say that explaining why something happens is NOT the same as justifying it.  Given that Thornhill's wife is actually a rape counselor (!) it would be quite odd if he wrote a book justifying it, to say the least.  What Thornhill and Palmer seek to do is take something that is a norm (yes, a norm!) of human culture, and try and figure out why the hell it's been going on for as long as anybody knows, and why it still is!        I do not believe that there is much scientists or anthropologists can say about a human nature: but they can say that men enjoy forming groups of men to go and kill 'outsiders' (however they may be so designated) (aka "war"); that many youngish men don't mind raping women, and in fact studies have shown that many men are turned on by depictions of rape in movies, magazines, etc; that most men are turned on by lesbian sex, and most women are NOT generally turned on by homosexual sex (i.e., men-on-men); and, finally that people like to congregate in coastal areas to consume cheap alchololic beverages when they have spare time (aka "vacation").  That's about all that can be said about a 'human nature.'        Let me end by noting that even if rape is a reproductive strategy for the lowest of the low- who have no other chance to mate- well, it is a very very UNSUCCESSFUL strategy when compared to normal one of picking up some tramp in a bar; or say, meeting a women around town and having an actual relationship with her, or meeting a girl in HS or college perhaps.  Whatever the case may be, rape is seldom successful in impregnating women, that's why most men don't do it!  In one behavioral ecology study, if I recall correctly, a study on scorpion flies, it was observed that out of 74 scorpion fly 'rapes', or matings that appeared to be forced, only 2 resulted in female scorpion flies being successfully impregnated!  Dung flies also engage some brutal tactics, every bit as brutal as some scumbag beating a women or drugging her drink at a bar or something.      I by no means intend this review to be comprehensive, but only to convey the fact that there is some substance to Thornhill and Palmer's claims, but they do a poor poor job for making their case.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying this book, buy Ghiglieri's instead and read Alcock's The Triumph of Sociobiology to get an overall better feel for Thornhill and Palmer's argument.  Finally, however, I believe that one thing that helps us humans out is that we can actually critically evaluate our thoughts and actions: if somebody says, "I couldn't help raping so-and-so, (or maybe just 'random woman')," then I would simply reply: "Take some bloody responsibilty for your actions, of course you could help yourself!"  A dung fly may not be able to decide, based on complex cognitive functions, to not rape a female dung fly, but a man can certainly decide not to rape a woman.  
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 It's not because it's so slow that I hate it, it's because Microsoft has decided that I'm too stupid to know what I'm doing so they've decided to protect me from myself and won't allow me to even look at what's on my hard drive. Every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing. It's so confusing to look at my documents folders, I can't figure out what is where. I can't view web pages on my own site because they aren't in the security frame of safe. All my USB WiFi devices don't work on Vista and the only ones available are extremely expensive. My cousin bought a Vista installed laptop and with customer support couldn't get it connected to his WiFi router at home because of security issues, so he took it back and got one that has XP Media Center on it for less. I was given a full, licensed copy of Vista Ultimate and I will not install it on any of my computers. If MS stops supporting XP and I have only Vista available in a PC, I'll buy an Apple 
 Once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover.  Unfortunately they've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising.  As the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual "content" in about an hour.  The rest is advertising and BS.  This magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago.  Just let it die already like it's supposed to 
 Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded.  He critizes Western music too much and sometimes his arguments are just plain stupid 
 I just wasn't impressed with the detail of this book.  Unless you know NOTHING of raising pigs, don't buy this one.  The "Storey's Guide to Pigs" by Kelly Klober was much more informative, buy it.  Sorry 
 Why did I think a book about a blue shoe was going to be an interesting read??? I can hardly give this book a one star. I've read some pretty awful books, but this is the only one thus far which has compelled me to write a review.  First of all, where does Mattie live? I live in Seattle and it doesn't rain as much as it does at the Ryder house. Why is it always raining and why is it so important to tell about? Every time the author wrote about the weather it was, ho-hum, here we go again. It pulled me right out of the story. There were other times too, that I was painfully aware of the writing, like with some of the author's bad analogies. The one about the cats being like Secret Service agents was definitely one of them. I am a cat lover and owner and don't get where Lamott came up with some of her descriptions and actions of the cats. While some of the analogies were very cutesy, they certainly didn't have any ring of truth to them.  Overall, Lamott's characters were only two-dimensional at best and I found none of them to have any redeeming qualities. Lamott's descriptions throughout the book , were awkward and redundant. How many times can you use the description "nuzzling"? It came to be that every time I saw that word I had to laugh. When Mattie isn't "nuzzling" her children or smelling the back of their necks she's totally neglecting them, or wanting to peel them off her like starfish, or whatever that other bad analogy was.  Mattie is a horrible person and a horrible mother. Sorry, I just couldn't relate and didn't want to. I haven't always had a perfect life or the best moral judgment myself, but, my God, get over it Mattie. Grow up and quit your whining!   I do have to confess, that this book wasn't so bad that I had to put it down midway through, like some readers, though I easily could have. Yes, the writing was bad and the story and characters lacked substance, but it was plain and simple enough that at least it was an "easy" read. One you could pick up at random if you had 5 or 10 minutes to spare.  Maybe I only read the book in its entirety, so I could justify writing a review about it. Halfway through, it was making me so crazy that I went on-line to read some reviews...I'd heard amazing things about this author and I had to know, "Is it just me?" It was reassuring to find that many others felt the same way that I did, kind of a support group for the mundane journey Lamott was trying to take me on.  Like many other reviewers, I read Lamott's Bird by Bird. A friend who is an avid fan of Anne's gave me the book as a gift and I fell in love. I wanted to read everything by Anne Lamott, now I'm not so sure. I will most likely give her another shot, sticking only to her non-fiction. There is so much truth and humor in her non-fiction that just doesn't seem to translate well into a novel.  I feel like this book never should have made it to print. With a lot more work, it might have earned a full one star rating.   
 This guide is written in French and is utterly useless to anyone who does not speak French 
 i WAS HOPING THAT I WOULD HAVE TIME TO READ THIS IN MORE DETAIL WHEN THE Y2K BUG WAS SUPPOSSED TO BITE. Since it didn't ,I have not had the time to get deeper into this book. I like it though and maybe when the children are grown I will try some of those recipes for bread.The storage info. is neat. I always wondered how the old-timers did that stuff  
 THIS WAS THE MMOST BORING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY.IT IS CONFUSING AND DID I MENTION BORRING.   P.S. MS.D PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFF MY GRADE SPELLING ERRORS  SIGN_  THE BOY WHO DIDN'T LIKE STORY TIM 
 There are instances where the translator includes things which Ibn Ishaq had not written about, and he does not, as mentioned earlier by someone, clearly demaricate this.  For example, the entire section about the Satanic verses is no where to be found in the original Arabic work, yet it somehow is in the English "translation".  There are other such descrepancies, so the reader should know that some of what he/she might be seeing is external to what Ibn Ishaq wrote 
 I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined. 
 After a fine opening, another look at adultery in academia, the plot goes crazy with a soul trapped in an emerald and a revolution on an island. Totally unbelievable. Silly dialogue. Where was the editor? Definitely this is one of the worst books I've ever read by an acclaimed author 
 "If a nut on the wall is a walnut, what is a nut in the bathroom?  A pee can."  "Why did the baby cross the road?  She was stapled to the chicken."  Billing itself as "the mother of all joke books", The Jokelopedia has the apparent goal of turning your child (or grandchild, etc.) into a comedian.  Categorized by subject matter such as a monster jokes, classroom distractions, family funnies, etc., the book contains riddles, jokes, cartoons, and tips from famous comedians.  Many of the riddles have pun-ch lines consisting of puns:  some that I consider funny, and many of which adults will consider groaners, but will get a lot of giggles from 8 year-olds.    Although I tend to like puns more than the average person, as a practitioner of non-violent communication, I don't recommend giving this book to children.  I am concerned that roughly up to 10 to 20% of the laughs come at the expense of becoming desensitized to the suffering of animals and humans.  For example, there's a joke about a woman who buys a parrot, and to get the bird to talk, she buys a mirror, a ladder, a bell, etc.  She goes back to the store and reports that the parrot died.  The clerk expresses his sorrow over her loss and asks if the parrot ever said anything to her.  The woman replied that just prior to dying, the parrot said, "Doesn't that store carry any food?"  So the joke is that the parrot starved to death because the woman was too stupid to buy food in addition to all the accessories.  There are riddles that have punch lines at the expense of animal suffering, for example, "What's black and white and flat? A panda that's been run over."  And the tacky frog in a blender joke, mentioned by a previous reviewer, could give a child the idea to actually try this (likely very few children but it's possible).  Although much of the egregiously tacky material is in the "Snot funny" section, there is some in other sections of the book.  Another reason I don't recommend the Jokelopedia is because of the practical joke recommendations.  The child who tries out these suggestions will probably think he or she is being funny, but those laughs come at the expense of being rude and crude to other people, and insensitive to their feelings.  For example, one of their slumber-party jokes is to pour cold water over the shower curtain rod on someone using the shower.  Another is to put another child's hand in a glass of warm water to get him or her to wet the bed.  Yet another is to put some fake plastic vomit in the sink.  One of the elevator practical jokes is to bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter in your nose.  Yuck.  Another joke encourages lying:  "Tell [your big sister] that one of her friends called (for this to work, be specific--use the real name of someone your sibling is close to and say one of the coolest kids in school is having a party tonight, but you can't remember all the details."  In case your budding comedian runs out of practical ideas to play on siblings and parents (yes, a parental practical joke idea involving the kitchen sink sprayer is provided--don't say you weren't warned!), there are five suggestions for tormenting the pizza guy.  One could, as another reviewer did, rip out some of the pages prior to giving the book to a child, or perhaps cross out portions with a thick dark marker like it's a government document.  (But if you rip out the page of slumber party practical jokes, the blurb on Lucille Ball is on the other side.)   Had I received this book as a child with pages ripped out, I would have been extremely curious about what was missing and sought out another copy!  Unless the authors write a new edition that takes out the practical and insensitive to suffering jokes, I don't recommend rewarding them by purchasing this book.  That's unfortunate, because I think some of the puns are very clever, and encourage children to have fun with the language. 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 I was sorely disapointed with this book.  I was hoping for the majority of it to be background and detail that wasn't covered in the series.  Unfortunately, other than some "physical data" on many of the star systems, a few in depth histories and one or two other tidbits, most of the information in here is directly from the trilogy, just repackaged.  This book was a waste of my money 
 Neil Mcallister's review says it pretty well, but I have to go on a tirade of my own here, if anything, to let off some of the steam built up from my anger at how dissapointing this book is.  Let me start by saying that you are probably a 30 something skater.  Yes, Phillips had an art career pre and post dating SCS, but face it- the screaming hand, the Indy  logo, that Grosso toy box deck you wanted so badly but by the time you saved your money up, the shop was out and you went with that Lucero instead... this is what we we all know and love the man for.  And, it's us who is going to be buying this book.  But, now before you buy, let me tell you that only a tiny portion of it is devoted to his SCS days.  There are some generally small reproductions of a few of the decks and other assorted graphics, and a few words which amount to not much more than random blurbs.  The portion on him in "Disposable" is way more insightful and comprehensive, this is just totally sparse.  As for the rest of the book- yes, page after page is devoted to his concert posters, and the bulk of the writing was about his early days- stuff which I didn't really care about, and I'm certain you as well aren't overly concerned with.  Yeah, I'll take the man's life story, but make it short and devote the meat of this to his experiences at Santa Cruz.  This book totally fails to deliver.  Really weak.  I think as well that it's just another money making scheme for someone.  Us 30 something skaters are a nostalgic, passionate lot, and there are many out there who would take advantage of that and try to rip us off.  Don't get taken for a ride by purchasing this!  Just reread his chapter in "Disposable", ride your Jessee reissue and leave it at that 
 I had to return this item because it was incorrectly represented on the website.  It is advertised as the book but, in reality, it is a study guide that it made to accompany the book.  It is important that Amazon make that distinction on the website 
 Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not  baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is  exciting . 
 I felt sad that this information Was actually  in hands of over million people,yet I know that Creator of Nature and it's powers in herbs will prove to be otherwise than described in this "book". There's some good info in it,almost as if you give enough good to trick the public in beliving the bad.  It is as if it was written by the FDA agents themself or Allopathic Medicine so called "Modern medicine".As if it was written to "label" herbs for not more than decorative. Almost Every herb that is truly amazing is somehow at the end of these authors "descriptions" darkened,and when you KNOW and PRACTICE herbalisam you know that iS not truth,and also I find it little "sticky" that there's a so called "miracle" drug out there that is a better choice? Man will never conquer the VERY CREATOR OF NATURE AND IT'S POWER,and no greed will ever rule over it! So KNOW that there's NO miracle drug out there,Nature with it's powers teaches us PATIENCE and that everything needs IT'S Time to Heal. Decide for yourself,please on this book. I pray that you enrich yourself with many books out there that HONOR MOTHER NATURE FOR ALL IT'S WORTH!PEACE BE WITH YOU! 
 If you are looking for a cutesy book you won't be disappointed.  If you are looking for information on identifying cattle of various breeds accurately - keep looking.  This book has a cut out mask that you can hold in front of your face so you can moo at cows over the fence.  There are no photographs of cows or anything else.  Black and white sketches only.  Buyer beware!! 
 As a practicing Odinist, I find this book to be extremely persecuting. Because of this author, and many like him i might add, many people are misled to think that all Odinists are White Supremacists, which just is not true. I think authors, like this pud, should be more wary in there choice of words and make it known with even the vaguest acknowledgement that a small faction of Odinists is of an Aryan mentality. I had to say my piece in defense of all my indiscriminate Odinist sisters and brothers in the world, so farewell 
 While this container holds nipples in place nicely and the basket is good for the standard infant goodies, the unit made by Munchkin I always use first.  The lower portion of the basket is awkward to open, and the placement of caps above the nipples means leftover water always gets dumped on the nipples.  Flipping the unit upside down does help both these issues, but then the nipples don't drain the right way 
 First of all, the statistical part of machine learning is JUST a real subset of mathematical statisitcs, whatever Bayesian or frequentist. Secondly, the non-statistical part of machine learning is not systematic or well developed yet.  We have used it as a textbook for a half-year course of Machine Learning. I think  [1] this book is a collection of many methods from Pattern Recognition, Statistics, Coding Theory, etc. [2] anyone who wants to make clear the algorithms of EM, ME, etc, DO NOT read this book. [3] it is suitable for undergraduate students in light of its simple mathematics. [4] the examples in this book are very very naive 
 Positive:  -Size, good surface area  -Chipping net  Negatives:  -Poor instructions  -Very hard to set up by yourself.  Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out.  -Nothing locks in.  Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly.  The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.  I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable.  I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners.  I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug 
 This is my second Daniel Silva reading, having read The Marching Season first.  This book spends far too much time and energy on character development and overly-detailed visuals.  There's way too much "atmosphere."  I'm halfway through it, and it is truly trying my patience.  I've checked out A Death in Vienna and Prince of Fire from the library, and have better hopes for them.  Marching Season was more action-packed than this one.. 
 Very nice, trendy little coffee-table type book, with pretty pictures and a small amount of general information you could easily find just about anywhere. Not a book for the serious researcher in spite of the glowing reviews obviously submitted by friends and relatives. It would make a nice gift for a favorite aunt or grandmother or a pal met at the spa. Do not purchase, however, if you are trying to find serious and detailed information concerning the history, lore and making of rare or even classic incense blends or you will be sorely disappointed 
 This book is composed by Prof. David Rutledge.  His class required the book, which is the sole reason for the book entering my hands.  This book, and the related course EE20 were the bane of my existence.  The book is useless at explaining the basics of electronics.  The book solely serves as a cookbook for the construction of a NORCAL radio.  It fails at teaching important conecepts, and could only be used by the most faint-hearted hobbyist.  On a related note, I have a spare book if anyones interested in buying one.  As for now, it just holds up one end of my dorm room bed 
 The Movie is great, but the used DVD is garbage. The DVD skips and stutters. I feel like I got taken to he cleaners 
 Before you get your hopes about the intellectual adventure Sokal & Bricmont have pretended to engage in, you should know what constitutes "scholarship" to these showmen by digging into their prior work a little.  Sokal, of course, wrote an article with many silly assertions, which he attributed, falsely, to French philosophers like Jacques Derrida (hence the "hoax") -- and he later tried to claim, with a straight face, that this pure fiction somehow "exposes" writers like Jacques Derrida.  His fans find this method of argument and analysis to be perfectly rigorous and logical.  Most real scholars who don't traffic in fictionalized hoaxes disagree.  Later, Sokal was forced to admit that he can't actually demonstrate anything wrong with any of Derrida's arguments.  It is fitting that Sokal chose Jean Bricmont, of all people, to co-author this book.  He needed somebody with a history of stretching the truth.  In his essay, "Postmodernism and its Problems with Science," Bricmont pretends to "argue" against the philosopher Gilles Deleuze with the following strategy: Deleuze at some point had made a historical reference to Hegel, and Bricmont writes:  "Of course, the reference to Hegel itself is amusing. Throughout his 'Greater Logic' [a work of Hegel's], one finds quite nonsensical remarks about limits, derivatives, and mathematics in general."  The logic is clear: anybody referring to Hegel in any discussion of mathematics is necessarily making a "nonsensical remark" because Hegel himself (according to Bricmont) has been known to make nonsensical remarks about mathematics.   Bricmont goes on to say that "the English translation [of Deleuze's book] inadvertently" mis-transcribes the mathematical formula he had originally written, an "error that thoroughly mangles the logic of the argument." In other words, Deleuze has written nonsense because his English translators had written nonsense.  But it gets even better.  In the very next sentence, Bricmont brings up the philosopher Michel Foucault to demonstrate the foolishness of that writer's work as well:  "And, in a comment on two previous books by Deleuze alone, where similar confusions about mathematics can be found, Michel Foucault wrote: 'I must speak about two books that are great among the great ones: _Difference and Repetition_ and _Logique du sens_ . . . But, maybe, some day, the century will be Deleuzian.'  Thus ends a major section of Bricmont's article. Bricmont has asserted that Foucault is clearly a charlatan because he approves of the "confusions about mathematics" that can reportedly be found in two *other* books by Deleuze, books which neither Sokal nor Bricmont have ever discussed. You might wonder why they never discuss Deleuze's well-known _Difference and Repetition_ to demonstrate the mathematical confusion that permeates the book. The answer: Because there is not a single mathematical formula or discussion of mathematics in _Difference and Repetition_. (And I am almost positive there is no such material in _Logique du sens_ either, but I haven't read that one in a while and don't have a copy.)  The reason Bricmont produced this lie is obvious: With Sokal, he is always desperate to draw the "big names" into his ring to give the impression he has "proven" something about them. But he can't do his normal operation of cutting and pasting some random excerpt -- carefully eliding all explanatory context -- because he knows too many people have read Foucault and will easily be able to call him out if he performs that maneuver. So he creates a ridiculous ad hominem argument by pointing to Foucault's praise of a couple of Deleuze's *other* books. And yet he knows that this is not good enough.  He knows it doesn't mean a thing if Foucault praises a couple of books that neither Sokal nor Bricmont can find anything wrong with; So he caves into that common undergraduate temptation to simply make up a lie to forge the necessary link: He invents the "fact" that these other books treat mathematical subjects, hoping to God that nobody in his audience has ever read those books -- just as he himself has never read them.  This is the Sokal affair in a nutshell. Aside from the "cut and paste" theater that makes no logical argument of any kind, it is entirely a matter of "scientists" making up stories about authors they have never read.  Let us remind ourselves about the only "positive" operation that Sokal and Bricmont have performed throughout this entire debate: That is, the operation of their "cut and paste" routine that supposedly demonstrates the meaninglessness of all these "prominent French intellectuals." Let us apply this operation to a random writer who penned the following statement:  "The elementary proposition consists of names. Since we cannot give the number of names with different meanings, we cannot give the composition of the elementary proposition. Our fundamental principle is that every question which can be decided at all by logic can be decided off-hand."  This excerpt -- which any man in the street will tell you is just as nonsensical as any of the excerpts Sokal cuts and pastes from other authors -- was written by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the _Tracticus Logico-Philosophicus_. According to the Sokal/Dawkins argument, this proves that the _Tracticus_ it complete and total nonsense, and that anybody who claims Wittgenstein writes anything more than meaningless gibberish is simply lying.  It is astonishing to me how quickly the ability to think logically falls away from ideologues like Sokal and Bricmont. It is understandable, however, if you recall that their project all along in this "affair" was to arrive at "truths" that they had already determined before they ever began their "investigations" -- truths about a whole range of authors they continually name, but have never actually read.  It seems fairly obvious to me who exactly are the charlatans and snake-oil salesmen in this entire "affair. 
 (Maybe 2 stars is a little harsh, but I'm not sure I can change it)  The book is relatively thick. It's full of the kind of detail I find somewhat tedious and a deterrent to reading cover to cover - but what to me is tedious might strike you as comprehensive. In any case it seems reference oriented.  There's a little too much pointlessly obvious and irrelevant detail (e.g section on the difference between a scanner and digital camera; a line drawing of how to set up an item of folding furniture which isn't even referred to in the text). Frequently sprinkled contact details for particular companies give it the feel of advertainment at times (eg the page dedicated to detailing modular furnings available from one retailer, complete with price tags and the supplier's web and phone details). It is in all ways US-centric, which is either an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your location.  Though on first look (I do own it) I found little to make me want to actually read the book, it might also as a passable 'wide but shallow' quick reference, especially if you're in the US.  It might also make an OK first book on the topic. I would recommend however, that the prospective reader preferentially (or at least additionally) purchase a number of more succinct, specifically targeted books which explore key topics in depth 
 I use to buy this magazine every mouth when I was much younger which was just a big waste of money all the stories and pictures can be found in any other teen bop magazine. This magazine is not for people who can actually read or understand any of the stories 
 I have to agree with a previous poster that most of the projects in here are pretty tacky.  Examples- decorating a pumpkin with mardi gras beads, or putting glitter on coin rolls to hand out for Halloween.  And there must be 7 or 8 diferent examples of the same painting of candle holders, just for different seasons of the year.  In all I found 3 or 4 itmes I may be interested in making.  Not very creative.  Not worth buying in my opinion 
 From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book.  However, this is not the case.  I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:  The laws are obvious.  Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list.  The reason that the author says the laws are "indisuptable," is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.  Don't waste your time with this book.  Instead, check out "First, Break all the Rules," which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork) 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 If you want to kill your time without learning anything, this book is absolute right for you 
 If you thought "BE HERE NOW" was their drugged up period, take a look at this, its terrible.  "Standing On The Shoulder of Giants" songs just don't cut it with their best tunes and Liam sounds awful. The guitars are pink and wacky at timed, Noels ones, and the wacky and abstract visuals just don't really make it look like the real Oasis, which is a shame.  ".....THERE AND THEN" beats this by miles, straight forward rock n roll played on guitars.  A very bad time for Oasis 
 I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst 
 Another disappointing Stephen King miniseries.  For some reason, lately I've been rewatching some of the older Stephen King miniseries that I hadn't seen since they originally aired.  Maybe I thought they'd be better without all the commercials to drag them on and on.  The cream of the crop is THE STAND.  The dregs is THE LANGOLIERS, with the worst special effects ever...Ed Wood would have been proud.  TOMMYKNOCKERS falls somewhere between.  Basically it tells the story of how one lady (Marg Helgenberger) stumbles across a mysterious little object in the woods, and is compelled to unearth it.  Turns out its some sort of alien craft with the power to exert its "will" on the people of the little Maine town nearby.  These people undergo gradual (or not so gradual) personality changes which allows them to "suddenly" invent impossible machines, read each others minds, and also to gleefully kill anyone who seeks to thwart them.  That's all well and good.  Sounds like it could be good, clean, gory fun.  Certainly, the book it's based on was.  I know that King himself is not terribly fond of the book, mostly because he wrote it during the height of his drug and alcohol additions...but it contained some of his most disturbing scenes too, and a believable, ultimately heartbreaking romance between the two leads.  I have always liked it myself.  (To me, King's nadir was THE DARK HALF.)  Back to the "movie."  Jimmy Smits plays Helgenberger's boyfriend, a formerly successful poet now awash in alcoholism...but trying to climb out of his hole.  He's immune to the power of The Tommyknockers because of a steel plate in his head, but goes along for the ride for much of the story because of the guilt he feels over his own behavior.  Eventually, things get bad enough that he finally musters up the courage to take matters into his own hands...with rather serious consequences for himself.    But the story is told in a plodding manner.  For every compelling scene (for example, early on Smits is at a reception where he's been drinking too much, and has a gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment) there's two clunkers (Cliff De Young and Traci Lords as two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky in the sorting room!!)  Helgenberger and Smits are fine, as are Joanna Cassidy as the local sheriff and E.G. Marshall as a kindly curmudgeon.    But the lengthy novel has been condensed so awkwardly, and the subplot with DeYoung and Lords given FAR, FAR too much time on screen (De Young is one of the worst actors EVER to get more than one role) to keep make even the gamest performances worthwhile.  I guess the producers were so tickled to have former porn star Lords on their set, they just couldn't help coming up with more ridiculous things for her to do.  Also, we are forced to see how far Robert Carradine (so good as the "head nerd" in REVENGE OF THE NERDS all those years ago) has fallen...he turns in a perfectly dreadful performance.  The special effects and makeup are quite cheesy.  But many things could have been forgiven had a decent adaptation been managed.  But THE TOMMYKNOCKERS was doomed from the start with a pitiful script, not helped by uninspired direction.  If you're a big fan of Smits, Cassidy or Helgenberger, I guess you might want to take a gander.  If you're a fan of Stephen King or horror/sci-fi...stay away! 
 I found the book heavy-going. Points are hammered home and I could not help wishing the book were much shorter. I do not think I as a reader would have lost much if there had been less detail. 
 this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?!  you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 Once thought of as a women's health magazine, Cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. At one point, Cosmo seemed to be a must-have, along with water and oxygen.  More and more lately, it seems that the magazine is posing the question "how can we survive on ONLY water and oxygen, and still be sexy while we do?" Ocassionally, a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics, but few and far between.  They don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article, is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself, thinking that she must conform to some "heroin-chic" fad.  Fun Fearless Female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. It shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful, but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world, without needing a man. If the magazine featured more of these things, maybe it would be worth my subscription fee.  But tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover NOT featuring the phrases "mind-blowing sex", "how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here)", or "barely-there", which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore, but EVERYTHING.  This isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. It's all about how to keep your man happy, while still conforming to social standards in fashion, weight, and financial standings. I'm sorry, but the "girl on a budget" can't afford a $430 skirt, or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+.  Cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status, pant size, and bank account 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 The book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories. Finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory. Unfortuanately, the don't offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good PC therory. Too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another PC mistake.. 
 And Suddenly, there was a flash..   and so starts at least 4 battle scenes.  We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan.  Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.    The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.    The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old. That is not to insult any 14 year olds, just a comparison to the language that you would expect from a young teenager of today.  Overall, extremely poor written book and boring cartoonish action. 
 This was the first novel I've read by Sydney Sheldon.  The character development, plot development and prose is drivel compared to books by Greg Iles, Joseph Finder, Nelson DeMille, Richard Crais, Michael Connelly, Sheldon Siegel, and Richard North Patterson.  Its so bad, I'm throwing the book out so I won't make the mistake of rereading it.  Raise your standards people!  
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 this movie is the consequence of matrices of impossiblities all occuring at the same time! can anyone say: basketball parachutes?, monks with catacombs made of human bones (which is secretly a labratory) and the monks are watching pornography, where did that guy get a tiger from, why try to sufficate someone underwater with a plastic bag, why was van Damme squatting a bathtub, why does Dennis Rodman carry plastic explosives a detonator and a coin Smoke bomb in his pocket at all times, where did Dennis get a dirt bike, why did Dennis take his shirt off after killing that guy, why did Dennis hide the baby? why doesnt hIS care for the babies mom?. . . . . .  the main question is why was this movie created 
 The first chapter piqued my interest by describing an encounter of the author's with some Middle Eastern businessmen peddling old documents.  However, after finishing the book, I am still wondering what this had to do with his story.  And I am also still wondering if he considered these the "Jesus Papers" of his title, or whether he meant the Dead Sea Scrolls or other old documents.  His premise, which takes over half the book to get to, is that Jesus studied in Egypt, was initiated into a mystery religion, and then went back to Judea to spread the word.  This is not really based on research, just his opinion, and some oblique references in Roman histories and the Bible.  The first half of the book was a rehashing of "Holy Blood, Holy Grail," but with some distinct omissions from the original (which of course support his latest theory, and he never explains).   This is a book for which I would read a synopsis - it will have in it everything that was worth reading.  The book itself is not worth your time 
 The cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it.  Makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments.  Design issue could be fixed easily 
 ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WAS PURE UNADULTERATED BS. I GUESS I EXPECTED AS MUCH BUT MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF ME. AFTER ALL DON'T FORGET SHE IS A CHIROQUAKER 
 I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 This frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter. The idea was great but the frame wasn't. It was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand. She sent it back and bought one she loves from Sam's Warehouse. 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 I really did not enjoy reading this particular book to the series.  I know it was intentionally disjointed but it was still annoying.  You get interested in a particular story and BOOM it stops.  No ending.  grrrrr . .  
 Be sure when you order this book you are getting the version you wish to purchase. The full size paperback is a gem. The minature edition is a waste of money. Be aware that the postage on the minature edition costs more than buying a second volume of the book on line used 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 Frankly, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I originally bought it for a Data Structures class and soon found that it was never of any use.  The book is extremely hard to follow and, at times, fails to include enough information.  Such as Big-O notation.  I count a total of 5 pages that show no useful examples but constantly talk about Big-Oh (notice the "h") while providing no solutions to finding the bounds 
 I appreciate and like Johnny Lang's music.  There is no doubt that he is amazing.  However, this CD is awful.  It does not demonstrate his true abilites and should have the "kid" still in the title.  The CD is good if you want to complete your collection, but this CD is not one worth listening to twice.  Save your money and wait for his next CD release 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 This is a good example on how to market a dead man on his miss fortune and cash out on his miss "fortune like Rick Rubin did on this one. If you want to cry buy this discs because it will make you cry because it is highly depressing. I hope that Mr Rubin that God punish you for this one I do not want to play it again and if you could read my mind Rick for this job on a dead great artist like Johnny Cash. I hope you walk the line to his grav 
 There are simply too many mediocre songs in this collection. It seems to be an error in judgement on the compiler's part. They're not underground classics, either - just vaguely experimental disco songs. They often seem pedestrian, with poor structure. There's also a lot of early synth pop in here - rather mechanical German-sounding disco. When you come across a good song, like BBQ's 'On the Beat', you realise how disposable much of the rest of the material is.  The quality of the transfers is very high, there's no doubt about it. And to a certain extent it is a fun collection. But there's probably too much forgettable material here. Would it really be any great loss if we didn't have Macho's 'I'm a Man'? I haven't heard the first volume, and there seems to be more classics on that ('Get Down Saturday Night', 'Superfreak' and so on). Part of the problem may be its European origins - they often prefer inorganic sounding dance music, more urban-industrial stuff.  There's one more problem - I think. I might be wrong about this, but when the CD was mastered, the volume seems pitched a bit low. I noticed this one other time with a CD from the Netherlands - it's a bit irritating to have to turn it up. If you listen to Soul Jazz's CDs you realise how good a CD can be. Overall I'm tempted to say skip this. There are better disco and Old School collections out there - I'm looking forward to hearing Soul Jazz's "A Tom Moulton Mix. 
 I bought the "Essential Heart" cd from Tower Rercords this weekend. I just tried listening to it but Track #17 SKIPS and shuts down my media player.  The store (TOWER) is closing down & they refuse to even EXCHANGE IT! They told me to contact the ones who release this album.  All the info. & links on the back of the cd are no longer valid.  I went to SonyMusic and even their links to this cd are defunct.  I was able to find [...]which links back to SonyMusic - but when I call the two "QUALITY MANAGMENT" phone numbers they have, both are defunct and refer me back to the store I bought it from.  I am extremely angry and want my $15 back! No wonder Tower is going out of business with such bad customer service.  All I'm going to be more careful before I buy a Sony/CapitolRecords cd 
 Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes.  Sorry!  I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks.  Needless to say it's going back to the used bin.  Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now.  What's the point?  These songs are derivative with a capital "D".  The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there.  The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB!  It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary.  Even my friend said "It sounds like these guys are about one year too late."  The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were "manufactured" to be popular.  Absolutely soulless.  
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 Monica Keena's colagen lips were bigger than this movie's budget. The acting was decent considering its poor script and dialogue- Way to go Monica. No monsters. No darkness. Heaven and Hell consists of nothing more than recycled scenes. Nothing is scarier than realizing how much time you wasted watching it. There's no deep spiritual realization that everyone else claims. - Overall this film was lame. Rent "High Tension" if you're looking for fright or "Kolobus" for lower budget horror. Both  are great!!! 
 I appreciated this book on modesty because it is an often over-looked subject among Christians.  The book is really short (only 74 pages), and I wish that Pollard had gone into more exegesis on texts like Genesis 3.  I thought the criticisms of the swimsuit industry were valid, but Pollard didn't offer any kind of solution to how a Christian female should dress if she wants to go swimming?  Should we just avoid it all together in fear of causing men to stumble?  Which brings me to another point.  Pollard seems to place a lot of blame on Christian women for wearing clothes that cause men to stumble and on pastors who refuse to teach their congregations about modesty.  On the other hand, he doesn't really place much blame on the men who give the women attention for wearing bikinis.  What is a girl to do?  As far as clothing options, she is already limited by the options availible.  Women's jeans are always made to fit tight in the legs, it is hard to find shirts that aren't tight, a modest bathing suit doesn't exist (according to Pollard), the fashionable skirts are the short ones.  Women my age don't wear these kind of clothes to stand out (at least at my age), but to fit in.  I bring this up because Pollard believes that our clothes should draw unnecessary attention to ourselves.  Overall, I am definately for modesty.  My mom and sister even say I dress like a grandma most of the time, and I agreed with the major premises of this book.  My only complaint is that the book is obviosly directed to men (with greater usage of masculine pronouns and more references to godly men and modesty), but it doesn't criticize the actions of the men as much as it does the women.  Rather than go on and on about how a Christain woman shouldn't dress to cause a man to stumble; I think the book would have been more effective if he also stated that Christian men should stop giving attention to scantaly clad women.  It really bothered me that he compared the issue as another incidence of Eve bringing Adam into sin.  Men should stop expecting women to dress immodestly, and they should also stop objectifying women by referring to the images as "hot" to other men or in the ear-shot of women.  Women do not dress immodestly because they like it, they usually do that because men want them to and its expected of them.  Both men and women should work to fix the problem, and I believe Christian men are just as much to blame as Christian women and the fashion industry. 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 This book in my opinion left a lot to be desired.  Tamara usually has more on the ball than she did in this book.  I know she's no superwoman, but really her deductive reasoning was way off base here.  And, does Basil DuPre have to show up all the time.  I'm honestly a little tired of him 
 I've read hundreds of business books over the years and this is probably in my top 3 worst books of all time.  I consider myself a fairly sophisticated real estate investor and this book gave me absolutely nothing.    Not worth anyones' time to read. Take a pass on this boo 
 The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.  But of course  you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer. The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash.  At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy.  
 I bought this book after hearing the author on NPR. I just can't finish it, it's heavy going and I keep being distracted for the concepts by the idea that the author uses a lot of obscure words to prove how smart he is. Informative but certainly not entertaining 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 The zipper on these bags will not stay zipped, therefore the air will not stay out of the bag and the bag will not stay compressed.  The first time I tried to zip the bag, the zipper holder fell off.  I put it back on but it didn't help zip the bag.  I then zipped it by hand, making sure I tightly zipped every bit of the zipper. I used two extra large size bags, one for a queen size comforter and the other for 4 accent pillows.  Neither bag would stay zipped. They are a waste of money. 
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.  This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.  Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I think this book is of, literally, only academic interest.  The author's premise:  capitalism will only be "safe" when protected by (Ta Da!!) -- more government regulation!  Only an academic (or a socialist) could come to this conclusion!  The fundamental premise of this book is that the danger to Capitalism is exclusively from "crony" Capitalists.  This is surely tantamount to blaming the victim for the crime.  The authors take tremendous pains to footnote a variety of statements, and then make a totally unsubstantiated claim of price-fixing against modern business by dredging up an ancient Adam Smith quote!  They point to the correlation between market regulations and higher stock valuations, mistaking it for causation.  Not one single time do they even mention the danger posed to capitalism by the MSM, socialist NGO's, lawyers, or the tangle of local, state, and federal regulations.  Only twice do they mention, in passing, the arguments of libertarians.  We are not a politically powerful party, but our opinions on capitalism surely must deserve, at the least, a vigorous rebuttal.  And finally, the recommendations are ad-hoc -- there is no flow of evidence or argument to support them.  Indeed, the conclusions are, in typical academic fashion, sadly naive.  An example is their belief that property taxes are somehow less onerous than income taxes.  This is a position in opposition to the authors' defense of property rights.  Indeed, Texas just passed a law to begin taxing business income because the previous system, based solely on business property, imposed no tax burden on doctors, lawyers, accountants, actors, authors, college professors engaged in sideline businesses, etc.  Little wonder that "old line" businesses were moving overseas or dying out -- they were supporting the parasites, doubly.  The reader is engaged only on the occasions (and by accident?) when the authors reveal insights derived from their experiences with other cultures, or when they review certain lesser-known historical facts.  In conclusion, I was disappointed in this "apology" for capitalism.  To give the authors credit, I would say that it must be very difficult to write a book espousing capitalism and still expect to get or keep tenure at a private, U. S. university, even one with Hayek and Friedman in the pedigree. 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 ... the extended version of the film has some serious problems. I bought this dvd after waiting years for a more complete version to come out. Sadly side two of this single disc release has some serious errors. Around halfway through the film my copy would pause for a few minutes, eventually skip forward, pause,play, pause, skip forward, and then it would eventually play normally with a few more pauses. After looking online I found that this problem seems to be very common due to how the disc was made. So to wrap this up, I'm a fan of the movie, but this DVD is sold to you broken thanks to Universal Studios messing it up 
 Quickly: FM reception stinks as others have noted.  It is truly horrible if you live near an FM transmitter as I do.  The 6 or so stations broadcasting from that tower come in all across the dial, totally washing out all weaker ones and all of the weatherband channels as well.  I've since learned that the fix for this is an "intermodulation filter".  Clearly this Sony unit does not have one.  Even my $15 battery-powered hand-held manual dial FM radio does a far superior job.  How stupid of Sony to not get this right!  CD sound quality is OK, no mechanical probs so far (2 years old).  TV and AM bands are OK.  Timer is minute-based countdown only - no alarm.  Daylight savings button to quickly adjust clock twice a year is convenient.  Clock is accurate.  Looks good 
 I expected alot from this book, and did, indeed, glean some useful insights. I am sure there is much, however, that I did not get from the work due to it's style. There is no focus in the composition, and most of the time it seems to ramble with no clear direction. The author does not state her thesis and present her supporting evidence; rather, she has an almost stream-of-consciousness approach, pulling in seemingly unrelated materials and ideas, depending upon the reader to make the connections. Her scholarship and love of the material are evident, but the author's style doesn't allow the reader to assimilate nearly enough of what she has to offer 
 My daughter just entered the toddler years so discipline has become an issue for us. A friend who is an educator gave us this book as a baby present so I thought I would take a look. I was interested in their approach until I read their take on mom's return to work. Basically, they say that children "thrive better" if a parent is home with them until they are three years old. I found this broad generalization to be both offensive and unhelpful. These authors are so clearly biased in favor of stay at home moms, it undercuts everything else they have to say. Moreover, there is shockingly little evidence to back up their various claims. There are two pages of footnotes for the whole book. If they are going to throw around such concepts as inner unhappiness, the all-powerful self and the competent self and trash working parents this way, they should at least have some studies to back up their claims. 
 These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans 
 I was interested in this book for 2 reasons: to understand what worked and to see the rantings and ravings of a madman. I purchased this book similar to the way people slow down to see car accidents on the side of the freeway. Mostly, I found the book the same way German found it when it was initially published - long winded and boring comservative rethoric. Before putting the book down, I made the distinction that if Hitler were a plitician in modern America, he would definately be one of the staunch Republicans who are afraid of science, social progress and their own shadows. On a positive note, the book further reveals the idiocy of his following as it reads a bit like the book of Mormon...not interesting.  
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 This DVD is unnecessary.  All material on this DVD is found on others.  The Series 8 & 9 DVD has the special and the three episodes are on other Series DVD.  This was released prior to the Series 8 & 9 DVD.  Don't waste your money.  If you are a true fan but the complete set 
 I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.  Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be "sexy", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).  But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so.   Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase "your breasts are wonderful"?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties "up her crack" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).  More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a "turn-off".  Bottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is "advanced bedroom skills" (Gray said that!) that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.        
 This was expected. A fanatic relativist dismembers absolutist views into little irrelevant pieces. Our civilization has been jumping between absolutism/universalism and relativism ever since its decline, with only a few people realizing a third alternative. With this whole book based on a flawed definition, it is a pointless and utterly tedious read 
 If you are looking for some insight into the history of terrorist networks and what motivites these peaople then keep looking.  If you are looking for a short book of facts about al-Qaida then this is the book for you.  I found this book extremely dissappointing.  For one it is a mere 52 pages. (excluding the bibliography and long appenices).  The rest  of the book is little more than a list of facts.  ie 27 pages listing known or suspected members with a brief paragraph about each and 15 pages of a timeline listing several dates with a sentance or 2 about each 
 I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable.  I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters.  The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library 
 Knowing the region described in the book quite well, as I am from that region, AND reading this book, I was surprised with the way author (who is a historician !!!) puts the outdated information about the certain countries of the region and their cuisines. Seing the map with the wrong names/borders in the book was just shocking!!! The author have not done enough research on INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED facts on the region, it's history and geopolitics, and therefore is misrepresenting the region and may actually be offencive for the people like me, who grew up in that region.   The names of some culinary dishes are misperperented and misclassified, too.   Instead of spending money on this book, I'd recommend searching the information available online, where you can find more truthfull and up-to-date informaiton, and a variety of recipes for free!  
 That was pretty much how I felt after finishing this terrible book.  I'm a Buffy fan (something of a purist - as I don't like the Angel spin-off), and only an occasional reader of BTVS novels, which - except for The Lost Slayer - always disappointed me. They were like McDonalds food - good to have around when Buffy's not on TV, but never satisfying.  So when I saw this novel, I thought it would be good. Holder is a four-times Bram Stoker award winner, and I figured the first novel set after the climax of the BTVS TV show would be of a much higher quality than previous novels, to satisfy the BTVS fans who want the story to continue.  But I was very wrong.  This book is absolutely god-awful.  I'd give it zero stars, if I could.  It's hard to pick on thing that makes this book so bad. Unscary and cliched villains; Regular Buffy characters acting out of character (since when does Oz give speeches?); Terrible dialogue (unrealistic, and with none of the wit or intelligence that's the hallmark of the TV show); The Yet Another Apocalypse plot, (something which Whedon and co. acknowledged was a cliche when the TV shows were running within the shows' storylines); Ignoring the continunity set up by the final series of Angel; during which this book is set (unless the worldwide Apocalyptic weather systems featured in this book decided to skip LA, and no one at Wolfram and Hart thought to tell Angel "A Hellmouth in Cleveland has opened"); Borderline racist characterisation of non-Americans (all Italians speak-a like-a this-a and are obsessed with clothes, while girls from Indian are all shy and hide behind veils); And there's the uncountable number of unnamed new Slayers who are casually slaughtered (it seems a new Slayer has a shorter life expectancy than a red-shirted officer in Star Trek).  But the worst thing about this book are the events Holder skips - battle scenes, action sequences, and major dramatic events she set up earlier in the book - they're just skipped and you're told the result of what happened.  For example, early in the book Buffy and co. encounter a pack of shapeshifters and go out hunting (doesn't have any bearing on the main plot). Only I think they do, because Holder skips the entire hunt. Buffy and co discover the monsters.  Turn the page, the critters are all dead.  The same thing is repeated again, and again, and again. Big set up. Expectation raised of major drama/action scenes. Turn the page and the events already in the past - sometimes by days.  Admittedly BTVS jumps around genres with wild abandon, but action is a major part of the series and the novels. Something that Holder either doesn't want to handle or can't write, so skips.  Even major events in the story - including the final battle, are skipped.  The only good thing about this book is twist at the very end, which completes the "Journey to adulthood" arc Whedon and co have been running since the start of season 4 of BTVS.  However, its execution makes me think Holder got her idea from reading Buffy slash fiction, and too many reports of angels visiting the dying in hospitals.  Only BTVS fans would buy this book, but they'll end up hating it.  In my view Holder took the publisher's money, handed in a first draft, and then legged it.  That all said, I found this book inspirational.  Because after reading it I thought, "I can write a better novel than this piece of junk!"  If you're a BTVS fan, avoid this book and spend your money on the new Buffy comic coming from Dark Horse - it's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 8 written by Joss Whedon 
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 If you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions, then this book may not be for you.  Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them, including plot points in 3D movies and so on. The book also leaves a lot out in other areas, such as dining (little coverage), getting around Walt Disney World, and off-site hotels and dining.  For me, the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (by Bob Sehlinger) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides. That is, it told me what might frighten a youngster, what might bore an adult, and so on, but it didn't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions. Just generalizations about the ride, then specific warnings for different types of people.  The only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide doesn't are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing. If you have an Internet connection, you don't need the pictures.  And as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps, you can't beat the Passporter book on Disney World.  So, for me, the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the best trip planning library for Walt Disney World.  If you like, you can also pick up the EZ-Guide, as it also has some interesting maps and info.  As for Birnbaum's, it really doesn't have anything to offer.  I wouldn't recommend against buying it, though, except for the "let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go" mentality. I hate spoilers, and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book 
 A waste of money and time.Information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it.So called expert tips are common knowledge...tips for a succesful email...1 be responsive to customers tip2 be honest all times,tip3test tip4 have a good mailinglist tip4 have a good offer or quality product.... WELL WELL that's great news. This book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling....You can easly see the book has been made in a few day 
 This is a movie so transparent, so pandering, so homophobic, so simplistic, so cynical it is really only for someone who finds re-runs of "The Jerry Springer Show" too intellectually challenging.  If you truly want to waste 90 minutes of your life, go ahead, but don't even expect one laugh: unless you think jokes about pedophilia are funny.  I wish that Amazon.com would allow me to give some things NO stars whatsoever.  This movie didn't bore me, it angered me 
 Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves gameplay, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predescessor.   I bought this game for one reason and that reason was that I was addicted to Baldur's Gate II and needed to expand my party based rpg addiction to another realm. Icewind Dale II seemed to be the logical option. I was wrong. I was immediately confronted with a story so corny that it is almost embarassing to take part in. I was confronted with gameplay that caused me to run back and forth from one place to another constantly. I was confronted with battles so easy that I was soon bored.   I tried to play it again, but again I was plagued with the same problems. I installed a bunch of unofficial patches, but those did not solve the problems with the terrible puzzles and whatever else.   The overload of puzzles and corniness would be ok if you could diverge from the one path as you could in Baldur's Gate II, where you could accomplish quests at the order that you wanted to. Here you had to accomplish everything in a linear order and could never diverge from the path. Furthermore, the story seemed to be a retread of the story from the original Icewind Dale. In fact, the design of the game seemed to paralell it completely.   The final problem with this game concerns the fact that it is difficult to play if you have no knowledge of dungeons and dragons rules. If you do not know how to use rogues or are unfamiliar with feats and the like, this game will pose a very high learning curve that you may not want to climb. I was mostly familiar with the rules, but it was easy to see that someone who did not know them as well could easily make mistakes or be unfamiliar with the use of certain classes (even though the rule book was pretty exhaustive).   All in all, I do not think that this is a good game. I would just go with Baldur's Gate II or Icewind Dale I instead of this game. 
 Read this book with several other classmates and found it ridiculous.  Zlata's only concern for several pages is that her canary might die because it's too picky to eat what they have.  
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 i've decided not to view any film from this director again. it seems to me this director and some other well-known chinese directors are all totally LOST and didn't know what they're doing. they all preferred cinematography to the integrity and solidness of a good story. all they did were putting exaggeration and pretentiousness into their movies, throwing away the simplicity and directness of a storyline that should be the main concern of a  watchable, worth watching movie. they are using cgi, post production, special effects computer manipulation as the dominant directing guideline. making all the movies become a slides show-like products, either with weak storyline or without any story at all. they are all addicted to transform the simplicity into over-killed complicity or overdone complications, everything turned into chopped up tidbits littered in a loose knitted film, edited together with constant flashbacks, like poorman's quilt, patched up whenever they could find a piece of cloth to patch up the falling apart quilt cover; like poor writers using italic sentences, paragraphs, even chapter after chapter to make up the storyline they failed to deliver more skillfully, blocking the natural flow and tempo of a story that should have been told more fluently. they've spent tons of money in carpentry, welding workmanship, construction more unnecessary settings, more technical gimmicks, meaningless stunts, more explosions from the controlled dynamite....to them, materialism is everything. superfluousness and hollowness have become philosophic depth and nobody dared to say anything negative to these directors. this 'three times' has reached the 3rd and the last strike to my limit of this kinda movies 
 I bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant. Unfortunately after about half an hour, the "memory foam" gets totally squished down and it's almost useless. Don't try to save money by getting this cheap one - spend the extra money and get one that doesn't suck. 
 On one hand, I give the movie credit where other movies have been unrealistic and phony, ADAM & EVE had the guts to make something very real. At times, TOO REAL. At times, unnecessarily TOO REAL.   They just had to slip in the gross out jokes to please all the immature goofballs out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a time and a place for gross out jokes, pubes in the shower etc., but they're less funny then something that takes execution and timing. Not to mention, they alienate the audience. The people that find that thing disgusting, are put off, and won't return.  Okay... back to the movie. ADAM & EVE is about love and sex. It's about a young HOT college girl, EVE (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and a typical college guy, ADAM (Cameron Douglas). They meet, find each other interesting, Adam tries to score and then Eve tells him that she's a virgin, and is being patient with her standing.  Then, as I said before, the movie is very real. All the things that come into play: the ridiculing friends, the things you do when your girlfriend looks like Emmanuelle Chriqui and you're being made to wait, the criticisms, the other girl that ISN'T holding out, etc. etc.   Although, I question one thing. Why in the world would a girl looking like Emmanuelle Chriqui be interested in this guy? She seemed like a nice girl. Smart. Nice room. Nice, wholesome girl. Yet, Adam is a partying bum. Lazy. Lives in a pig-sty. His yard looks like a trash dump and he goes and lays in his bed all day. His friends are the epitome of bums and womanizers... but then... I thought about it, and realized... actually, when I was in college, yeah... that was about right. Women liked these type guys.   Although, I do give the movie credit for being real, there wasn't enough going on. There weren't enough side plots and not enough to keep the movies pace going. When the movie deviated from the MAIN plot, it just went and told gross out stories with Adam's loser friends, or showed little side stories that never really explained themselves.  Ultimately, the only good thing I can say about ADAM & EVE is that it was realistic. Otherwise, the movie was less than average, and pretty forgettable 
 This book is a good idea. But there is room for litterature that can tell the same in a more lively way with far fewer words. ...or can tell four time as much with the same number of pages. - The language of most of the authors is such that you wonder WHY they have chocen to say what they attempt to tell in such flowery ways. After a paragraph it's hard to remember "What did he try to tell me now." It's easier to think: "Yes. I can see that you have learnt a hole lot of words, and adjevtives in particular." - I have found litterature about the same topic, put in a different language that manage to do this far better. In fact I've found public reports that with regards to the ability to convey a thought is far more readable 
 Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine.  Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant 
 The original Jungle Book was inventive, whitty, uplifting and charming.  The characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful.  The original Disney Jungle Book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child.  I can honestly say the original Disney Jungle Book movie was the only movie I loved that also touched my heart.  Jungle Book 2 is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the The original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching.  You will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of Jungle Book 2.  Don't Waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money.  It gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
 I have read the Book of Mormon more than 12 times in English and once in Chinese. If you plan to use the Mormon missionary methodology (read, ponder, pray) to find out the "truth" of the book, at least read Mr. Grant Palmer's book Mormon Origins first so you will understand the origins of the book about which you are reading and praying. Personally, I won't be reading this version of the Book of Mormon or any other version again. There are too many other fictional books that are more worth my time. Don't drink the Koolaid (unless you know how it was made). 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 WARNING!  My Oxford World's Classics paperback copy had pages of Thoreau's "Walden"  inserted after p.158 of the story "The Room in the Dragon Volant."  Missing are approx. 50 pages of the LeFanu story, so it's not like it's a bonus.  I'm letting Amazon know about it, but check your copy on receipt!! Very disappointing to not know what happens, kind of like watching a thriller on TV and then the power goes out, but the broadcast stays on so you miss the middle.  I do rate LeFanu's stories 4-5 stars though.  Really well-written page turners 
 You can't write a mystery without a solution and call it "pulp" or "noir" in my book.  Those of you who are fans of King's writing will find this readable, but hardly enjoyable.  Those who are not would do well to stay away.  We're halfway through the book before we're even introduced to the "mystery", and we're finished the book before we're told that there's no solution to it.   And worst of all, none of this seems to bother the Downeast characters narrating the tale 
 This novel seemed like a rush job. The characters are so prolific that you barely get to know who's who - is it human, animal or hunting history being shared. Too much to sort out and too little meat to make it worth it 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 He said that it is mostly filled with advertisements for boats and fishing equipment and rambling talking by his director 
 I found the DVD to be completey inappropriate for children.  Too much violance and too much swearing.  My kids watched 5 minutes of it and its now in the garbage 
 I have to say something about this Cd...I mean,I know Marc Anthony tried to do something different this time and he did it,but pop is not his thing..."MENDED" is a weak album,with 2 or 3 good songs as "Love Won't get any better" "She mends me" and maybe even "Tragedy" that's all. I used to be a fan of Marc Anthony's Salsa albums...but this is actually pop from hell. Sorry Marc...Just do your thing 
 It's useless... I bought one last month and started to use it for preparing the AP Exam... but it's useless... the tricks are "common sense" and the practice problems are too easy... if you really wanna buy a good review book... use Barron or Princeton Review.. 
 I am extreamly disappointed with this product. The icons do not give an indication of the type of weather you can expect. Instead, they provide an indication if the weather is getting worse or better. The fluff on the out side of the box states: "Forecast Icon Based on Changing Barometric Pressure." The way I read that is the Icons will provide a forecast, but they do not.  I do not understand why you would have a rain Icon, a cloudy icon, a partly cloudy icon and a sunny icon if they are not a forecast. I was so surprised at reading this in the manual, I called La Crosses tech support. Tech support confirmed what I read was accurate. As stated, in on of the other reviews, the station is difficult to read when it is stand mounted. You will have to bendover or be in a seated position in order to see things clearly. Adjusting the contrast does not help. Wall mounting might be a better option. The buttons, as stated in another review, feel mushy when pushed. The outdoor sensor is not compleatly weather proof so you will need to mount it where it will not get wet from rain or snow. A potentially great product that is poorly executed.  
 I am not a fan of the band, I have listen to this cd a couple of time and I am not very pleased with it.  There is just a couple of good tracks, not enough for me to keep this cd.  I will use it as a gift for somebody who will listen to it, because I won't if I keep it 
 Don't but this little book! It has less information than most of the magizine articles that are the basis of the author's knowledge base.  It is unclear if the author has ever meet,interviewed or seen Mr. Waits preform.  Huge omissions and years of information are not present.  Some facts like the fact Tom had a relationship with Ricky Lee Jones or the first 3 albums for Island are a "Trilogy" are mentioned numerous times in a attempt to pad this books 150 double spaced pages.  It looks and reads like a bad high school term paper 
 I had pretty high hopes for the book Changing Minds: The Art And Science of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds by Howard Gardner.  It looked like it would be a good book for learning the art of, well, changing peoples minds.  Instead it was an academic journey that I found difficult to draw applications from...  Contents: The Contents of the Mind; The Forms of the Mind; The Power of Early Theories; Leading a Diverse Population; Leading an Institution - How to Deal with a Uniform Population; Changing Minds Indirectly - Through Scientific Discoveries, Scholarly Breakthroughs, and Artistic Creations; Mind Changing in a Formal Setting; Mind Changing Up Close; Changing One's Own Mind; Epilogue - The Future of Mind Changing; Appendix; Notes; Index; About the Author  Gardner puts forth his theories of mind change based on three factors...  four "entities" of mind change (stories, theories, concepts, and skills), six "arenas" of mind change (from nations down to one's own person), and seven "levers" of mind change (all words that start with "re", like reason, resources, and resonance).  He uses a number of examples from history to show how ideas and people were able to move others from one mindset to another.  On the surface, it sounded like an interesting premise that I could apply in my day-to-day activities.  And at times, the writing almost succeeded.  There'd be glimpses of the person behind the writing, almost as if there was a conversation going on.  Then there'd be a retreat to academic analysis and pacing that made it a chore to slog through.  His attitudes and preconceptions are also quite evident.  For example, he seems to hold Darwin and his theories in high regard, while denigrating "fundamentalist" Christianity.  Granted, this wasn't a book on keeping an open mind, but I didn't quite want to be labeled as ignorant if I don't happen to agree with him or hold the same views in life.  Someone who is heavily into academic theory or the study of the human mind might well find this interesting.  But if you're a busy professional looking for practical insights to work with, this is going to be a real stretch.. 
 Any blurb that begins: "We think of Europe as the charming continent of windmills and gondolas..." signals a book that doesn't set its sights too high up the evolutionary tree. It's like saying "We think of America as the charming continent of cowboys and obesity". It's treating the reader like a five-year-old.  Yes, Europe has problems. But it doesn't hold the copyright on riots, minorities that can't be assimilated or no-go zones in ethnic ghettoes. If more citizens of your wonderful country actually shifted their butts out of their air-con SUVs, got passports and came to visit Europe, you wouldn't need silly, patronising books like this. And, yes, we've got windmills and gondolas, if that's what makes you happy. 
 I have been a Patty Griffin fan for a few years now. I LOVE her slow, lyrical ballads... her voice is just beautiful. BUT... when she picks up the pace and starts with the guitar banging and endless warbling, I just stop listening and skip to the next track. Unfortunately, with her last 2 CDs, I find myself skipping more tracks than I listen to. 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 Quite possibly one of the most poorly-thought out rants I've read yet on the whole "entertainment is destroying America" controversy.  All arguments he presents are simply straw men that he's created to bolster his point.  None of the serious criticisms that have been laid against him and his work have been seriously addressed.  Don't waste your time with this drivel.  One star 
 Girls in this movie are portrayed as underdogs struggling against stupid boy bullies. It's a pretty way to boy-bash and promote sexist stereotypes that girls are good and boys are bad. 
 The Pros: Tracks 7-12 are listenable.  The Cons: Where oh where do I begin...  1) This is a Chicago album right?  This album features session cats more than it actually features members of the band.  When I buy a solo album by a favorite musician I expect him/her to be backed up by session cats.  When I buy an album by a band, I expect the band to play on their own album-- not predominantly outside musicians.  Am I expecting too much here?  A band that traditionally kept things "in house" and only occassionally brought in guest musicians-- is it too much to ask and expect them to actually go back to keeping their music "in house"?  2) The track order.  Okay whose bright idea was it to stack five or six ballads in a row?  Tracks 7-12 are at least respectable and listenable but the listener would never know that if he/she started listening to the album from the beginning as it would put him/her to sleep well before it got to the meaty stuff.  3) The production.  It's clean, it's polished, it's pristine... Trouble is, it's SO clean, SO polished, SO pristine any and all emotion is stripped completely from the music.  There is no feeling here.  It's all superficial, the depth and emotion of the album is completely AWOL-- this I don't blame on the band, but on producer Jay DeMarcus, who over-produced the album to the point where it was/is emotionally STERILE.  If you want to listen to Chicago, they did put out some pretty good albums, this isn't one of them-- it can't be, because it isn't even really Chicago (if you read the liner notes you'll realize that).  Don't waste your time or money on this.  It's better than Chicago 19, but then again getting a filling is better than getting a root canal-- I wouldn't exactly be rushing off to my dentist for either 
 I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself 
 My rating of 2 stars applies to the SACD version of this record and not the CD.  I consider the CD to be a 5 star recording.  After carefully listening to both the two channel SACD mix and the CD stereo versions I could not discern an audible difference.  I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and found the rear surround to be tasteful and subtle, not at all distracting, but, again, no significant improvement in detail except that created by spreading the sound around to five channels.  A recent article on the "Stereophile" website suggests that the SACD mix in fact shares the same 16 bit lineage as the CD, which would explain why the two channel mix and the CD mix sound identical.  Norah's label has cheated its customers with this one and should go back and do an actual DSD mix and replace these "CDs" for free or give us our money back.  There is no reason to purchase this SACD in addition to or in lieu of the CD unless you are interested in listening to a standard resolution 5.1 mix 
 This book was just awful. If you are curious, get it from the library. 
 I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work. 
 Another simplistic, generic, super conventional, template-derived, power-pop emo band. If they had any respect for music they would stop what they're doing right now 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I'm sorry, but I find his vision of America implausible.  I suppose the United States could turn into a third-world fascist country in the next ?20? years, but I'd need more explanation or back-story before I could willingly suspend my disbelief.  That would be enough for a 2-star or 3-star review.  What, frankly, offended me about the book was the psychopath in uniform and the Homeland Security monsters.  I'm a veteran, I know other veterans, I know people in the service right now, I know people who've been to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The psycho and the "Homesecs" are an insult to our troops.  The afterword says the book was inspired by the events of 9/11.  I'm afraid my sympathies are with the people risking everything to keep more innocents from being blown up by terrorists.  I was really looking forward to this book.  I have almost everything Varley's written, and have never given anything less than 4 stars, and usually 5.  But not this time.  An immense disappointment. :(  If you liked this book, I hope my review doesn't offend you.  Maybe I took it too personally.  I just want to warn others who might react as I did.  I wish I hadn't bought this 
 With so much great potential in this project, it's a shame it had to be so terrible.  Can you imagine if the author had talked to people who had a functional understanding of Springsteen's music, instead of just people who were like, "Yeah, I listened to him back in the eighties!  'Borrrrn in the USA!!!'"?  The author is remarkably uninteresting, and his subjects not much better.  Even the cop, commenting on "41 Shots," could have been engrossing had they picked a more interesting cop.  This one was just like, "How?  How could be betray us?"  Not even giving a moment's consideration to the real question of whether they were betrayed or whether those cops really were racists and murderers.  Would have been nice to at least touch down on that point 
 I was excited to learn that S.E Hinton had published a new book, and greatly looked forward to reading this new novel by one of my favourite authors. I think ultimately, S.E Hinton should have just left well enough alone. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found this book hugely disappointing. It was limp and boring; the plot "twists" were obvious, and the characters were transparant. It almost felt like she was trying to channel Bram Stoker but ended up with Anne Rice instead...I do not recommend this book 
 I dont know what the other 30 people who reviewed this book thought was so great about it. I couldnt even finish the first chapter. It was so dull, boring, and frankly a pathetic attempt to be a "hip writer". I wont lie, it had some good information, all of it common sense. I have 2 kids and I got it for the first one. It was a huge waste of money and time. I still have it, probably because I cant just throwing it away. Maybe I'll sell it on Ebay to some other pathetic fool 
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 Navy airplanes. Viet Nam. Minor love interest. This one stuck pretty close to form for the genre. It started off a little bit slow, and the technical details were overemphasized a bit. Overall it isn't a book I'll remember a month from now 
 My biggest problem with this book is that the characters are just not likable. I found it extremely hard to relate to any of these guys, and didn't find any of their lives extremely interesting.  I would hope that not too many young people just coming out really expect life to be like this. Every guy in this book is a beautiful, musclebound man who hops in and out of bed with different partners. *Yawn*  The subplot with the mother and son (just coming out... and also a fabulous stripper) dating the same guy seems either ripped off or an homage to Gordon Merrick. Either way, it doesn't really work.  The guy they both lust after is a creep of the highest degree.  If the quality of the writing on this book were perhaps a bit higher, this plot may have been pulled off.  Instead, this is a lifeless, dull and rather unsexy book that has not inspired me to check out any other books by this writer 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 The plastic is really thick and hard to get an iPod mini in and out of. If you move your iPod between docking stations and speakers, this is too cumbersome to deal with 
 in the picture it shows the jacket plain black with orange inside. when i got it it patches all over it saying the name brand, that were velcro so when i pulled them off i had velcro patches all over the outside of the jacket. i had to take it to a seamstress to have them removed. the kind of material would have been easy to damage if i had tried to remove them myself. i was very disapointed and will never order from them again 
 Before you vote this review down, I ask that you fully read it, so you can understand why Sin City does not function as a good film.  Sin City unfortunately is an absolute mess.  I sat down to watch this provocative disaster about a year ago, and it has stuck with me ever since.  It has lingered for so long because it is representative of everything that could possibly go wrong with a production such as this.  I am fan of Robert Rodriguez's directing. I also absolutely love everything that Quentin Tarantino has cranked out since his inception as a director.  I grew up with interest in the occasional Frank Miller graphic novel.  This is why it is so sad that Sin City fails on so many levels.  Within the first 23 minutes of watching this film, I was praying that it would be over soon.  I only stuck it out so I could one day write this review.  Let's break it down to its most basic levels.  The film has great directors, great actors, a great story, and a great production design.  With all of this going for it, one expects "Sin City" to be a landmark movie experience, and it is -- though, for me, the experience is a negative one, and the attainment it achieves is in the depths of pointless, mean-spirited exploitation.  The film tells three stories (with a fourth vignette as a framing device): Bruce Willis battling a child-molesting monster; Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk out to avenge a girlfriend's murder; and Clive Owen as a private eye helping a band of imperiled hookers.  The three segments transpire more or less in sequence (with some confusing overlapping) and all take place in Sin City: a super-corrupt, super-violent, super-shadowy, and in every other way super-exaggerated caricature of a '40s Hollywood film-noir world.  It's a caricature of a caricature.  No one would ever confuse this world with reality. The heroes shake off multiple gunshot wounds, devastating blows to the head and other lethal overtures like slaps on the cheek; the hookers all look like Victoria's Secret models; the scenes are ugly day dreams.  And, to be fair, the stylish blend of CGI- exoticism and continual chaos generates a certain visual fascination. Sin City, however, can't sustain it, and after the first segment it's hard to imagine how anyone could find its trashy excess anything but tedious, obnoxious, and repetitive.  Everything that happens in the movie is an calculated cliche. The stories have a minimal narrative drive or interest, the banter is banal pseudo-Raymond-Chandler babble and the performances are as shallow as most "SNL" skits these days.  Rodriguez is rather vain because of his pride in the way his movie so faithfully bows to the "genius" of Miller and re-creates his comic-book world with the same kind of religious devotion Gus Van Sant paid to Hitchcock with his frame-for-frame "Psycho" remake.  Is comic-book art some special invention that deserves such recognition? Aren't movies already enough like dumb comic books without actually trying to BE one?  Though it's not immediately obvious, "Sin City" is a comedy, and its aspiration is to pull off the Tarantino trick of making its audience wearily laugh at the outrageousness of its sadism at the same time it subtly gets off on it sexually.  And it's out to one-up Tarantino by basking in the pornography of brutality on a large scale, a giddy spectacular in which we sit back like Romans at the Coliseum watching people being decapitated, disemboweled, dismembered, castrated and humiliated.  Check out Fellini's Satyricon if that is what you are really after.  The publicity has made a big deal about what a "risky" commercial venture this is, and how heroic it was for Rodriguez to insist on putting Miller's name in the title and above his own in the directing credits. But this all stinks of the worst Hollywood insincerity.  For one thing, can anyone doubt that such a violent, low-budget movie with such a lineup of stars will make a ton of money? Given the distance "Sin City" pushes the envelope to on sick movie violence, and given the recent Columbine-like massacres, such a backlash from the Christian right and other voices for movie censorship seems likely (and Rodriguez may even be hoping for it).  I don't support these voices for a minute: I don't believe in censorship and I don't think movies motivate mass murder. But I do think that a film like this, especially one made by a major director under the flag of artistic integrity, adds something ugly to the air for which critics must hold it accountable.  Sitting through the thing, watching scene after scene in which I was being asked to be entertained by the spectacle of helpless people being tortured, I kept thinking of all the other horrible acts that are being committed today and how we, as an American society are taught to think that it is all so gruesome and atrocious.  I suppose some people don't find it that bad. "Sin City" is their movie. 
 Okay, so I know its a harmonium, but jeez is that instrument tough on the ears.  Nusrat's vocals are powerful and inspiring, the tabla sets a nice beat, but the harmonium ruins the show.  A little harmonium, OK, but not the WHOLE CD.  What you get is Nusrat drowned out by the extremely annoying off-beat, wailing, choppy drone of that awful harmonium. If it wasn't for the passion that Nusrat brings to the recording, this cd would be no better than one star.  If it wasn't for the grating harmonium, "Shabaaz" would be a four star effort. For Nusrat's inspiring vocals with a more soothing backdrop, try "The Prayer Cycle".  Or buy "Shabaaz" and groove to the agitating vibration of the harmonium 
 Be advised that after 45 minutes of the movie my 8 year-old son and I gave up. Goodman seems to have been given the license to "go for broke" with a "larger than life" approach, that leaves little for the viewer to consider of Ruth's actual life.  With the broadest of strokes, Goodman  plays Ruth self-consciously; the mis-en-scenes are without any surprises and Hollywood-predictable.     Too little was shown to give us the sense of Ruth-as-athlete and the milieu of early 20th century baseball, a fascinating story that awaited telling but missed the opportunity here 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 This EP is very curious in that most of the trademarks of Death Cab's sound are nowhere to be found.  I can't say that I know that Bjork song that they've covered, but in general, I don't care much for Death Cab's cover songs because they tend to play them as fans, rather than playing them as if they were Death Cab songs.  20th Century Towers is a fairly forgettable number, and while Stability is a good song, now that we have a more concise reworking available on Plans (The Stable Song), its lost a bit of its sheen.  If you love everything Death Cab has done, there's probably something for you here.  But if you're looking for an entry into what the big deal with these guys is all about, I would start with something else 
 Ok- so I can see there are some die-hard Julia Roberts fans out there.  Too bad.  Just raving about her will never improve her acting skills (an oxymoron). Actually, the poor quality of this movie is astounding, considering its director, the cast (excepting our girl Julia) and the book upon which it was based. Though he's done some much better work, when Pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing:  "Hmm, 'Presumed Innocent' was a winner. Let's follow that same formula and do another one. It'll sell." Unfortunately, by the time the story from the book by John Grisham got to the screen, it lacked any of its original punch.  As for Denzel, he should be ashamed of himself. He's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach. I guess he probably needed the cash for another house.  Then again, he's opposite Julia. No further comment needed  -other than, save your money 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 I bought this book, and several others in the whole french chic genre.  I agree Frederik Fekkai's book, A Year of Style, and Genevieve a Darieaux's book are supreme.   So is Things a Woman Should Know about Style by Karen Homer.  Leah Feldon's advice on dressing rich and dressing thin is along these lines and really good value if you are trying to create a core or capsule wardrobe along french chic lines. Which translated simply stands for quietly elegant.  Anne Barones 3 Chic and Slim books have a few gems in them too, available on her website, although not for the inflated prices on the web. Google her name and the title, and the site should appear.  Finally Entre Nous was a great book discussing a lot of different aspects of french life including the diet, wardrobe, manners etc.  This book in comparison comes up WAY short. The pictures are outdated already, which wouldn't be such a problem if the text had anything of value to say.  The classic perfume list was interesting,   but you can figure that out using Karen Homers tiny but terrific little book Things a Woman Should Know about Style (which is a terrific companion to Genevieve a Dariaux's A Guide to Elegance-- it updates Genevieve quite nicely).  all in all I'd say hang onto your money, and buy:  Things a Woman Should Know about Style by Karen Homer and  Genevieve a Dariaux's A Guide to Elegance along with  Frederic Fekkai: a Year of Style (out of print now, but worth getting!) and  Does This Make Me Look Fat?: the Definitive Rules for Dressing Thin for Every Height, Size, and Shape by Leah Feldon   Leah has good advice on shopping for quality, and if you want more, she has an out of print one that dates back 20 years that still has good advice in it.  If you are still thirsting for more, go to Anne Barone's site and order chic and slim and see if you like that,   as well as Entre Nous by Debra Olliver.  That little "bookshelf" will net you a thousand times better advice on learning grace, style and chic than this little photo essay book 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 I am one of the biggest fan's of Friends in the whole world , i am right now trying to collect them all , i have so far season 3 and 4, they are very very funny, but season 5 i have to say is probably one of the worst. Now for it to make sence you would probably want to collect them in order, well not really, cause i think all get season 5 in last, so all go right over to 8!!!, lol yes 8!!, i herd that its one of the best. If your a big fan wait till the end to get season 5 cause its the crapiest 
 The main argument of the book is simple: as countries go from dictatorship to democracy things get worse before they get better. This has been a central argument of political science, and Mr. Bremmer neither acknowledges what others have said nor does he add much to them. All he book has to say comes in the first ten pages. After that it is snipets of histories of countries which do not add much 
  Was a bit disappointed, I was at least expecting a Raw, unadulterated version of the original film. Since it was a straight to video release. No lesbian action, no nudity and Allison Lange is a very attractive girl. They did her no justice  in this film with that wig on her head. This writer could have taken this to a new level like "Poison Ivy 3 : The New Seduction ! Everything was just reacted and poorley executed ! I will give it 2 stars because there was a lot of eyecandy Kristen Miller is a beautiful woman. And I have always thought Allison Lange was cute since "Christina's House".There isn't much more to say on this one. Was entertaining just didn't deliver anything new ! U can tell they were operating on a very poor budget.    
 Somewhat interesting, but I should have known that there was trouble brewing when I spotted a typographical error in the second paragraph of the dust jacket of the book.  The main character's name was mis-spelled.  The book reads like a dream...disjointed, rambling, and out of focus...probably best forgotten the next day.  Good for a flight across country, but only if you have already read the day-old Tribune that you found at the airport.  This book seemed to have been created from the cuttings of the editing floor of another book and stitched together with a very fine piece of twine.  Two stars if you have little else to read on your journey 
 The author gets way of course on various subjects. The book, in my opinion, is a bore. I have read several publications on area 51 and this book was a real struggle. Very little substance and a lot of hype. I couldn't finish it. The silly cover should have tipped me off.. 
 I was so excited for my Groovaloos DVD to come, but I was very disappointed. The dancers take 5x more effort showing off then actually teaching steps. There is no step breakdown, no counting, no different views. They basically do the dance 1 time at a medium pace and expect you to just catch on from there. I watched it twice and decided to throw it in the junk box 
 Hatsumi is right up there with scientology.  Complete fabrication that people can't wait to pay for.  Not one useful piece of information is this book 
 This book comes with a RECORD!  I haven't had a record player in a decade so the usefulness was limited.  It could be terrific but without a record player I will never know 
 There is no objective advise here.  While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based.  Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book.  The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store.  If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you!  But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Buchanan's witty prose and charming dilect. He is obviously skilled in "spinning a good yarn" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries 
 A fun read, but you'll finish it in under an hour and it doesn't really lend itself to a re-read. Even the pictures are more glance at them once then move on icons than bits of art you'll ponder for more than a second.   On the other the book would make a fun gift for the guy that fixes your computer for you. If you're already yelling "Hey! I take care my own computer. Sheesh!", then you probably already own the book. Heck, I bought it. So if you don't already own it and just have to buy it, read it carefully and then wrap it up as a silly gift to someone else 
 I rarely ever fail to complete a book I've paid for but after about sixty pages of Edward Klein's docudrama I don't know if I'll be finishing.  Instead of a historical summary about Hillary Clinton's life and policies, Klein elected to open with a series of tenuously credible accounts from interns who witnessed marital strife between her and Bill, accusations that she's a secret lesbian and obvious observations such as criticism of her seemingly inborn political nature. I didn't see the makings of any ruminations on the real reasons to question the merits of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy (i.e blatant nepotism in federal government, her relative lack of charisma to inspire the masses,  the failure of the first Clinton administration in response to the USS Cole bombing etc.)Instead Klein seems content, at least in intoductary chapters, to make glib carpet muncher referances about Mrs. Clinton his thesis for why she would make a bad president.  The minimum price of this book is skyrocketing upwards of twenty dollars.  If you don't like money then buy it. 
 Conrad's comments are completely re-inforced by my experience with this book. Oh with the addition of the fact that there are numerous spelling errors throughout 
 Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money. 
 Though this item may be a piece of junk, I just wanted to clarify something for everyone. Steel will always rust, even the "stainless" steels. However, it is more resistant to rusting so long as you care for the item. For example: Dont leave in a the sink for too long, dont leave it outside in the rain or a puddle of water because it will rust. 
 This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders 
 I am one of a growing number that find Larkin lame and flaccid. You read, you understand, you move on. There is little to struggle over, nothing one wishes to reread. Simple poems of a lost England 
 I love Lee.  I mean his stuff is just so much fun.  When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked.  Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read.  I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road.  Then I read the Messenger.  This is the worst I have read from Lee.  It contained none of the fun of his other novels.  Stay away from this one.  
 This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions 
 This book deals with a very important and timely topic.  The Cold War had a major impact on academia, and Price is to be applauded for undertaking such an extensive archival research project to document how these dynamics were manifest in anthropology.  His greatest weakness, however, is an uncritical acceptance of the egalitarian rhetoric of the  Soviet Union and the US Communist Party as signifying a genuine committment to humanitarianism and equality.   This grossly inaccurate assumption underlies Price's key theme in the book:  that the FBI and other security agencies in the United States (aka the bad guys) persecuted leftists and communists (aka the good guys) solely as a means to maintain existing race and class hierarchies in the United States.  Anyone with a passing familiarity with the violence and aggression of communist party politics in the 1930s, or the history of the Soviet Union (including its genocidal approach to ethnic minorities within its own borders) should realize this is quite a crock.  Price is certainly not alone in his myopia in this area:  his assumptions reiterate many cherised illusions of the Left.  While these shortcomings may have been forgivable in the past when knowledge about the Soviet Union was more uncertain, any contemporary scholar who ignores the overhwelming array of evidence and testimonials that have emerged from Soviet archives since the end of the Cold War renders himself and his work largely irrelevant to contemporary academic debates in this area.  In that sense, Price's work fits in well with earlier anthropological activists, such as those who militantly defended the Rosenbergs as innocent victims of anti-Semitism and US Cold War hysteria.  Soviet archives have shown, of course, that the Rosenbergs were quite guilty and their defenders in academia were willingly duped by the barrage of Soviet propaganda released on their behalf.   Price continues to reiterate the same theme in his work, never once considering that a peek in the Soviet archives might offer interesting revisions to his assumptions.  Did the KGB maintain files on Franz Boas, Margaret Mead and Gene Weltfish?   This book would make a much greater and more lasting contribution to Cold War scholarship if the author had even a token awareness of the Soviet side of things.  Unfortunately, like so  many leftists, he is more intent on using FOIA to bash the United States rather than to undertake a serious analysis of the way anthropology became suspended (or distorted) between rival superpowers during the Cold War.  For an insightful and disturbing account of how these dynamics have influenced other social sciences,  see Harvy Klehr and John Haynes recent book "In Denial:  Historians, Communism and Espionage."  It is much more enlightening than Price's work 
 We bought also the keybord and the adapter (as recommended) and it does not fit. I already tried to buy a new one, but it is not available 
 How many times can I say pompous?   These authors have so inflated their egos that I can not imagine sharing a room with them.  I certainly would not want to share an office or any job with them.  The authors love "technology" - and that can be a good thing. However, they so completely mix up the means and the ends. In teaching a well educated student is the "ends" or our product.  Give me a tent and something to scrawl on and a good teacher will put out a good product: a well educated student.    Technology is a tool we can use.  Just like any other tool when people see someone using it, AND it improves the job in some manner they will switch over to the new method.   The emphasis on technology is wasteful.  All, yes 100%, of the information this book is devoted to can be picked up by anyone in a single semester course.  This is from a teacher who: always uses an electronic grade book, posts assignments and other information on my web page, has converted almost all of my lectures into PowerPoint presentations filled with pictures, QuickTime video shorts, links to current events in the news.  My students have assignments which require internet research.  Some of their assignments they can access from anywhere (on vacation in New Zealand!), at any time, with or with out partners, and can use a wide variety of resources.    My students score well on state tests, actually really well.  However, with no "technology" (a tent and some chalk and slates) they will still do well.  Let's not confuse the tools with the real job, and these tools are VERY easy to learn.   If it makes sense people will do it, use it - if not - they SHOULD not 
 I usually enjoy James Pattersons' Alex Cross stories. I am not a die-hard fan, but I have always found myself entertained when reading most of the previous novels. But London Bridges hit rock bottom almost from the very beginning.  The story is made from the same formula the past 3-4 Cross-stories has been, and you can almost guess what will happen in the super-short chapters.  First we are inside the mind of one or more of the villains while they commit some gruesome crime, and the plotline is laid out. Then Dr Cross enters the stage, usually semi-depressed over something in his private life, a condition not made any better by the crime he is called in to solve, again usually with a bunch of colleagues, who can be detectives or federal agents, depending on where you are in the series. This time he is upset because of his youngest son, who lives with his mother in Seattle, a long way from Washington DC, where Cross resides with his older kids and his grandmother. Cross is also upset because he has to break up a date with his girlfriend Jamilla, a detective living in San Francisco, in order to get to the scene of this novels 'basic' crime.  This time the villain The Wolf has blown a trailerpark community off the face of the earth, and threatens to do the same to some of the world's major cities, if he is not paid a gazillion dollars and if some political prisoners are not set free. A deadline is given, the clock is ticking and Cross travels from America to Europe and back again and then to Europe and then to USA again within a week or so, in order to catch The Wolf and his fellow thugs, each of the thugs acting out their piece of The Wolf's big puzzle and way to world dominion.  The last 10 pages are utterly confusing, there is no tail nor head, the story seems to be all over the place, and at last you really could not care less if Cross and his whole family will actually survive the ordeals.  This book is not recommend for anyone excpet die hard Patterson/Cross fans. It does not live up to the expectations, but if Patterson can write 5-6 novels a year, then maybe there is an explanation for this book's lacking in quality 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 I bought this for my 9 year old without looking at it. There is a picture of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake and the wardrobe malfunction. When did that become a world record? I wish I hadn't bought this 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 I have been a huge fan of the original "Mad Scientist's Club" since I was a kid.  I continued to re-read it as I grew up and read it to my children.  Needless to say, when I found out that another Mad Scientist's book was coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  None - and I mean none - of the stories reached the level of any in the original.  As an example, The Flying Sorcerer was nothing more than The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake "gone airborne" or The Unidentified Flying Man of Mammoth Falls "light".  My advise is to stick with the original, save your money and skip this one 
 I fell in love with the Boccherini piece when I heard it in the movie, and bought the soundtrack mainly for it, but what you get on the CD is a very short arrangement and not very satisfying.  It was also a disappointment to find that the soundtrack doesn't include the end titles music from the movie, which I enjoyed.  It's still a good CD for listening, just not what I hoped for 
 The storyline of this novel is ok. Having read the Da Vinci Code, it pales in comparison, both in the actual line of "thinking" and the fleshing out of the mystery around the Magdalene myths.  She also has the additional struggle of working with myths that are not as woven into Christian mythology as the Da Vinci theories. The audio CD is not so great. The narrator sounds older (more mature) than the main character of the novel is supposed to be, so I am constantly having to remind myself that she is a younger woman.  Also, the narrator's attempts at accents are mediocre at best. A rolled "r" does not a Scottish accent make, ya know? I find myself distracted by the lapses in her accents 
 If you know the physiology, and want to review, get a little deeper, then OK, BUT COME ON. Have the other reviewers used this book to learn physiology from. The writing is horrible, the book needs an editor. Perhaps the writers should have taken some more writing classes, and less physiology when they were in college.   Don't use this book to learn physiology! It just bombards you with facts (like I said, a reference manual) but is horrible at explaining concepts, so then you just sort of memorize, memorize for exams, and a month later you can't remember anything, because it's such a mess in your head.   
 This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker.  There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised.  While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives 
 For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested.  I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling.  When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, "I didn't think of that one."  The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters.  The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained.  There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended.  It left me wanting to know more.... 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them 
 This book is for a school student doing their studies.  The information is very general and there isnt any information about salaries!  It really doesnt help if you are trying to descide what type of amimal career you are  trying to get into 
 The Tenant is a film that wastes time and loses viewers.  Long stretches of time where nothing happens, something quickly happens, then we are back to the monotonous pace - excruciating to watch.  Never have I checked and checked to see how much of a film was left.    The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide.  He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants.  Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl.  But the pace is so slow.  The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with.  He has a beautiful girl interested in him - why?    The end - which I won't reveal - is absurd instead of unsettling, mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point 
 We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not "up to snuff." If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.   Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.   Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort 
 This is LeCarre's most pedestrian work.  It starts well, getting one involved with the two major characters.  But then it seems to tread water for much of the remainder of the book, at times making very little sense.  One character becomes a caricature and unlike some of LeCarre's main characters in other books, I found I didn't really care what happened to him.  He behaved in unexplicable, erratic ways that simply were not convincing.  The denouement at the end was equally unconvincing.  Sorry I cannot be more positive, but this book was a real disappointment 
 I bought and returned this after using Navigator 2,3,4, & 5.  The problem seems to be TomTom has pressed some defective DVDs.  I was unable to install the North America map or activate the Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico maps.  TomTom support could not provide a reason as the states and regions installed without problem.  There also seems to be two continental maps, a 0.9gb less detailed US and Canada map, and more detailed 1.3gb North America map with more POIs and richer map features.  I think the US & Canada map was stripped down so it would fit on the pre-installed SD cards they are selling.  It didn't seem to me that TomTom support had a clue as to what was supposed to be on the DVD.  Maybe TomTom will straighten this out but I would sure avoid Navigator 6 for now.  TomTom is a great product until you have a problem.  Then you are on your own 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours. 
 Don't buy it.  In the 6 months I had the phone, the screen burnt out so I can see the numbers, the answering machine is horrible, and I get better reception from my baby monitor.  I had a cheap Panasonic beforehand which was much better.  This was a complete waste of $$.  Hooking it up to your PC to get those "cool" features is just a pain.  I'm having a tough time returning this.  Be careful 
 I'm in the process of confirming the rumour that Rod was being seriously considered for a knighthood until the royal family was accidently subjected to listening to this CD.The rest,as they say,is history. Let's get serious, Every performer of Rod's stature has the right to dress up and sing like a lounge lizard once and awhile. But like every good joke you only have to tell it to the audience once, not three times and counting.The only group that applauded the release of this CD were chronic insomniacs. Rod needs to emerge from the "counting room" of his Graceland mansion in St.Tropeze and get serious about the music instead of the bottom line. Forecasts are not promising. The music industry is abuzz, that his next project under consideration is a tribute album to the legendary Harry Reser and the Clicquot Club Eskimos orchestra. It's being leaked on the web,that through the state of the studio art, Harry's instrumental tracks are being combined with newly created lyrics for many of his best selling tunes. The standouts include,"The Old Town Pump" and"Send Me Back My Honeyman".I have serious reservations concerning the project's success, particularly given the weak performances represented on the American Songbook Vol.3. However,hope springs eternal. 
 I'm sorry to say, I didn't make it through the entire book.  I got lost in all the Vale's, Abbotts, and priests, and a new type of religion around every corner.  Ana was a hunched over witch of the forest in one chapter, living in a cave and speaking cryptically.  The next chapter, she was a sweet grandmother who lived in the basement of the church, and spoke directly, plainly, and gently healed all the sick, while engaging in secret rituals, a'la Da Vinci Code Priory of Sion.  After that, I had no idea how to take her.  The good and evil religions were difficult to differ, and the at first evil Jamon is proved to be a turncoat brought to the good side in about two paragraphs .  There are a plethora of excellent fantasy books.  I can't recommend this as one of them 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table.  Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.    "A Fine Balance" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601).  By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel. 
 This is the first and only Denis Johnson book I've read, and it wasn't a good one. I'd heard such great things about the author that I was very very excited to start reading this book. I was more than let down by this book. I didn't even finish reading Angels, and that's rare for me. Don't get me wrong, the man's a talented writer, but a horrible storyteller, and if you don't have both you're worthless to me. I've been told that Denis Johnson's short stories and poems are better than his novels, so I plan on checking out Jesus' Son. If you want to learn how to write reading Denis Johnson would probably be helpful, but if you want to say something ignore this book. Read Ask the Dust by John Fante for great writing, and great storytelling 
 A very scholarly and authoritative work to be admired by academics everywhere - almost useless as a quick means to look up what a botanical name means.  If you were to take a semester or so studying this work, it would probably turn out to be very useful.  For example, the chapters are broken down into Habitats, Geographical Names, Colour Terms, Greek words, Descriptive Terminology, Chemical Reactions and Tests, etc.  So, if you happen to already know that sagittatus is a descriptive term, you can go to the chapter on Descriptive Terminology and find out that it means arrow-headed.  If you don't already know this, good luck finding out what it means in this book 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 I consider my completition of Herlitzer's COMEDY WRITING SECRETS to be one of my greatest accomplishments this year, as I can remember fewer more arduous uphill battles. The first problem with this book is how old it is. Published in 1987, he refers to rising stars of comedy like Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. Since comedy is like any other fast-paced media, these guys are practically the wise old men at this point.   With the way he breaks down humor in here, into such contrived formulas and over-simplification, it seems he could never have imagined the popularity of stand-ups like Dave Atell, Mike Barbiglio, Lewis Black, Jon Stewart or the atrocious Colin Quinn. Humor has simply changed too much since he wrote this book.  And while this book may contain little gems here and there, he consistently uses the most TERRIBLE jokes for his examples (like: "wife to husband, opening present, 'It's what I always wanted! Did you keep the receipt?'").   I hate to disagree with every other reviewer, but I think that this book's advice on comedy only applies to the select few of us blessed with time machines 
 The bean is small, battery efficient, and has a nice overall look to it. Thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product. This is NOT an mp3 player, it is a TRAC player. You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take. If your looking for an mp3 player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mp3s into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you. This device is the Stalin of mp3 player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 I checked this out of the library & only read about 1/3 of it. That's about all i could take of this mean-spirited, one-sided, repetitive diatribe.  Please read the Pub Weekly review above. It gives a fair picture of this crappy book.  I have no problem w/ criticism of hollywood & celebrity, as long as it's fair & intelligent criticism. This book is neither. It's just a biased, unoriginal rant.  The worst thing i can say about it is that the tone is that of a smug, intolerant, finger-wagging, self-righteous hypocrite of the worst kind. Of course the authors, while condemning these  celebrities, have no problem making money off of them (& their misfortunes). These guys are the worst kind of blood-sucking insects.  If you're really curious, leaf through it at the library & then put it back. Please don't give these narrow-minded idiots your hard-earned money. 
 IT'S A REAL SHAME & COMPLETE IDIOCY THAT NUMBER 1, THIS SHOW ISN'T SOLD AS A SEASON PACKAGE & NUMBER 2, THAT THEY CAN'T SELL IT AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE.  For example, if there was a dvd that had a complete season for around $20 or a dvd that had the complete seasons 1-3 for no more than $40-50, this would make sense. It was a great show, but come on now lets be sensible & reasonable about thi 
 I am big fan of PAX (Armstrong's company)and I own her book, CDs, and have attended her seminars. I really liked Keys to the Kingdom in the book version, however, friends and family that listened to the book on CD hated it. Not sure why exactly, but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead. Also, you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist. Hang in there though, because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships. I can't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men. Did I also mention that apparently Alanis Morissette is also an Armstrong fan? In a nutshell, get her book, and her other CDs like "In Sync with the Opposite Sex". Also, her CD "The Amazing Development of Men" is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in "Keys to the Kingdom", which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars 
 I was there, as were several of my fellow Sitka Fire Department EMT's and State Troopers from the Sitka Academy.  The 6 of us, along with two parajumpers from the Canadian Armed Services were flown through the typhoon winds, on a helicopter, out to the Williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed.  We knew there was a doctor onboard, from Anchorage, but we literally never met or saw him - I'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed.  The real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend.  But I was disappointed to see that Mr. Jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the Sitka rescue teams played (both on the Williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the Prinsendam) was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side & had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event.  I was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out, was very sad.  At least we all have our commendations from both the Coast Guard commendant and the Canadian armed services - they knew we were there!   Too bad Mr. Jeffers didn't due diligence. 
 The Jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish. After one hour of use the Jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. So don't say you weren't warned.     
 had to send (2) smokers back due to damage during shipping. was not shippers fault. very bad packaging,would be suprized if anyone could get one in good shape 
 I generally really like well-researched historical fiction, and have been a big fan of Dorothy Dunnett and Philippa Gregory (though the latter takes a lot of liberties with history).  I was quite drawn into this book from the first sentence, and found the description of life on the manor rich and convincing.  But.  began to switch off around the time we discover Jacob Cullen is possessed?  haunted?  by a "Voice" that encouraged him to brutally kill a young boy, and then rape his new bride.  Jacob ends up in the New Model Army where he forms an intense relationship with Ferris, who is a naturally good man.  The descriptions of the war and the brutality are vivid and detailed.    After they get back to London, Ferris becomes obsessed with forming a common plot for "diggers," and he and Jacob form an intense homosexual romance.  At that point and for the rest of the book everything was rather overheated and lusty.  It seemed like every other page was a description of longing for the embrace or the sweetness between their legs etc.  I would have been equally bored if this had been a heterosexual couple, but I couldn't connect this simpering Ferris with the earlier Ferris, and Jacob's bouts of violence began to bore me.  The book ends when they've been kicked off the common brutally by the neighboring lord, with the implication that Jacob could have stopped it but just didn't, and Jacob is on a boat to America crying. The Voice is silent.   I feel as though I didn't get it. A number of readers here assume the Voice is a symptom of Jacob's schizophrenia or madness, but it's presented in the book as though it really is the devil.  Well, which? Did Jacob rape his own brother when he was a teenager, as implied in one scene?  I kind of resented the way the author withheled information from us-- it's first-person narration, but the author only conveniently reveals/remembers these types of things, when for the first 70-80 pages of the book, Jacob is presented as well-liked and decent.  It just seemed flashy.  The book's change in focus and tone felt somewhat ad hoc.      Lots of loose threads with Jacob's family.  Ultimately, I was disappointed.  After zooming through the first half, I just naturally slowed down and took a week to read the rest.  By then I was cottoning on that the author was never going to reveal the mysteries, that no one plot was going to develop in a satisfying way, and that she enjoyed vivid descriptions of violence and sex but not deeper characterizations.  She can definitely bring a period to life, but the characters were ultimately shadowy and the storytelling was disjointed 
 Too much experiments and not enough melodies.  I prefer his previous works like Oxygène and Equinoxe, but I really don't like this one. Call it sounds experimentation but not music.  A average of 4,5 stars rating should means an almost perfect album, we are really far from this. 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 This was the first backcountry cookbook I bought. I was looking for recipes that could be mostly assembled at home, would be lightweight to transport, and were easy to cook over a backpacking stove.  On first glance, this book appeared to fit the bill. Most recipes are assembled at home, dehydrated, and then rehydrated as a one-pot meal. However, I tried several recipes this past summer while canoeing and camping in the BWCAW and found the texture and taste of most of the meals to be disappointing. Many of the same ingredients are used over and over in "different" recipes, so many meals taste the same. Also, since the recipes are twice-cooked, the texture is often mushy.  Shortly after purchasing this book, I also bought Lipsmackin' Backpackin'. I ended up using this book for almost all of our camping meals, supplemented by hummus and candied walnuts, and a few other random recipes from Backpack Gourmet. I don't think that the purchase of Backpack Gourmet was offset by the few recipes that we regularly use.  I would recommend buying a different backcountry cookbook if you are intersted in eating something with flavor and texture. If, however, you aren't interested in flavor, but are simply looking for a meal that can be made quickly at camp and has all the calories and nutrients you need, then this is probably the book for you. 
 I read 1/2 of this book and loved it. What an incredible adventure.  I then googled the author and found several stories, including a special BBC investigative piece, that showed evidence that the author completely fabricated the story. Polish soliders were given a general amnesty and released from gulags in order to assist the Russians in fighting the Germans.  Very dissapointing 
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 The two volume Dover edition is much much better.  This is watered down, and doesn't contain the important details that make it so interesting.  It has very few of the illustrations found in the two volume set.  This was a big let down.  I bought this thinking it was similar to the Dover addition which a friend of mine owned 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 I am so happy to see that other people realize what a pile of crap this so-called "classic" is. I read it about twenty years ago and even then recognized what a fundamentally phony book it was. A book on images of America in rock and roll, huh? Well, let's see, who's missing here?  CHUCK BERRY -- not a word.   BRIAN WILSON -- nothing.   LIEBER AND STOLLER -- nothing.   BOB DYLAN -- nope.   EDDIE COCHRAN -- zero.   Griel Marcus is the kind of guy who thinks he can make anything sound classy by comparing it to Huckleberry Finn. And not the text written by Mark Twain, either. No, that might mean having to quote and cite evidence. Marcus loves to talk about the "myth" of Huckleberry Finn, like the culture created it. No,  as Huck tells us on page one, "that book was written by Mr. Mark Twain." And you know what, Griel bubbe? You -- ain't -- him!  Most of the music Marcus actually writes about in this book is fifth rate crap nobody ever heard of. He doesn't review big hits because then the reader could actually critique his views and compare his raving with what the songs actually say. Harmonica Frank was a nobody, a non-talented non-entity, but Marcus gives the guy a full chapter so that Marcus can say whatever he wants without any contradictions. It's the dumbest form of elitism and one-upmanship masquerading as populism.   Another problem is Marcus' sentimentality about violence. Note well that this is a coward who wouldn't have made it through Army basic, let alone combat in Vietnam, yet he writes page after page after page about how joyous and invigorating it is to listen to songs about Stagger Lee shooting Billy, and rednecks slashing each other with razors, and God knows what else. Forget drugs and groupies, this is true rock and roll decadence.   The best part of the book, as most critics admit, is the section on Elvis Presley, pretentiously named "The Presliad." Elvis was no Achilles, and Griel Marcus is no Homer. Elvis was a coward, a liar, a weakling, who despised his audience and betrayed his music every chance he got. Marcus never comes close to owning up to Elvis' failures as a man and an artist. Elivs sells his soul to the devil, or to Nixon, and somehow it just makes Elvis more of a victim. Why can't Marcus admit that Elvis was trash? The music was good, sure. But the man was trash. Marcus isn't adult enough to handle that kind of contradiction so he falls back on endless babble about Ahab and Huck and the American "myths" that are not written down, not subject to rational discussion, and in fact seem to exist only in Marcus' head.   And they call this rock criticism 
 Well, I bought this book cause I'm learning jazz and they didn't have great tunes.  Even though it's over 600 tunes, it's still not that good.  I suggest getting another book.  Plus, like others said, the print is really tiny and it's annoying.  My friend, who plays bass, couldn't even read over my shoulder 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 The item you get is decorative at best.  Doesn't have any kind of a gong sound at all.  I suppose thats what it was met for but still...  The book it comes with is funny 
 A College textbook or reference-type book.  Comprehensive--fine print.  Seemed a good read, but I didn't like the set-up.  All text was in the front, and the examples and photos were grouped in the back.  One would need to flip back and forth to view examples of the subject matter.  Didn't work for me.  This is the only reason I gave it a low rating, and returned the book 
 Saw this on the box last night. I sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't. I kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film. The dialogue is wooden, the plot is pathetic, the whole set-up is unconvincing. It looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole "Vegas" craze - which ranges from CSI to "The Cooler". (Incidentally, "The Cooler" is another one to avoid.)  I would give this zero stars if I could 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 How I made it through this poorly executed, poorly written sequel, I have no idea. Catherine's in trouble again and people she meets are dying. Who's the murderer, Catherine, the shrink who lusts over her, or the cop who's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key? Catherine certainly gets around: She manages to befriend the most unlikely of people, all associates or ex-wives or enemies of the shrink, and most of them end up dead. Is she trying to drive the shrink nuts, or does she plan to kill him?  This movie makes little sense: It doesn't thrill or tantalize. And it offers Sharon Stone in an unflattering light, as a cold seductress with little to offer but mindless sex. But then that seems to be her best role, doesn't it? It doesn't work this time around, and the only realism is in Stone's sneer: It looked all too natural 
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 I was assigned this book for a class in East Asian-World Politics, so I read it thoroughly and was thoroughly disappointed.  The assumptions that this book is based on are fallacious and misguided, and the authors seem to  have no understanding of either Chinese political culture or the nature of  international relations. To begin with, the book spends most of its time  highlighting and exaggerating sources of tension between the two countries,  and seems to assume that every tension between two states will inevitably  lead to full-scale war.  This assumption is sadly mistaken.  In fact, the  United States and Canada have outstanding disagreements on a number of  issues, yet experience close relations and have the longest unguarded  border in the world. The book relies mostly on provacative statements made  by members of the Chinese Communist Party to support its thesis.  It  ignores the fact that it is common practice in Chinese politics to speak  loudly and negatively about whomever China currently disagrees with.  Just  because a member of the National People's Congress says war with the United  States is inevitable over human rights doesn't mean it will happen.  Have  the authors ever heard Jesse Helms (or many other senators, for that  matter) speak?  Note their reluctance to use force to settle the Taiwan  issue. The entire book comes off as a heavily-biased college paper on  US-Chinese relations.  The fact that they use virtually no primary-source  material or Chinese-language material not already translated adds to this  perception.  It appears that the authors decided the hypothesis of the book  beforehand, and simply searched for information to support their theory.   As flawed and biased a book as I have come across in a long time 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 I've seen these scenes in so many different movies that I got bored and  turned it off. It was just a poor copy of other good movies. (Like 633 squadron) 
 This book is not for everyone that's for sure. It seems to have an exhaustive list of words that it covers but it doesn't give you any details of their meanings. Although it very briefly, and I do mean breifly, defines  a few words it seems to be more of a thesaurus than anything else. Also  there are no graphics at all. Not so much as a drawing. So if you want more  than wham bam thank you mam then look elsewhere. Other than that. Go ahead  and have fun. Knock yourself out 
 I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers.  The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute 
 Not really worth watching if you read the book. Do yourself a favor and read the book. 
 Maya Angelou is an expert at writing easily remembered catchphrases and proverbial tidbits that have all the taste of wisdom with half the calories.  She fills her fans with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, she inspires them, she makes them feel as if she speaks The Truth.  In other words, she's great at writing motivational proverbs.  She is not, however, a poet.  Not even close.  She displays virtually no poetic craft and shows no real skill at compression, imagery, figurative language, and metaphor, to name a few tools that make a piece of writing a poem.  At best, this collection would bore the pants off of any serious reader of poetry.  At worst, it will make them want to gouge their eyes out with a pair of #6 knitting needles.  If you think this is poetry, you haven't read any poetry yet 
  Betty Edwards book,  "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" is 80% text and only 20% illustration for all 254 pages, and very few of the illustrations are Edwards' personal drawings.       It is a clunky and overly intellectual approach to drawing, presenting a virtual,  THEORY-OF-EVERYTHING.      According to p. 46,  an "alternative state of consciousness" is required before one can draw. That's NOT liberating an "artist within" but rather binding the "artist within"  to Edwards' art theories,  hardly a liberating work.  Moreover,   where are the scientific studies that prove that Betty Edward's "students"  have obtained an  ALTERNATIVE  STATE OF  CONSCIOUSNESS?  There are none of course,  because it never happened.   There is no such thing as a scientific measurement of "consciousness".   This is why Edwards claims are such a baffling mix of SCIENCE  and  SENTIMENT  and  unverifiable by any known means.  It is not just bad that this is PSEUDO-SCIENCE.  It is PSEUDO-ART THEORY!          Consider this quote:           "Although the exercises themselves are based on classic systems of drawing instruction,  she presented them in a simple and LOGICAL manner that made them especially easy to learn." -----Brainy Encyclopedia website       If this is a LOGICAL system,  it flies in the face of the RIGHT-BRAIN methodology, because Edwards has such a wordy text that only those operating in the ANALYTICAL & LOGICAL LEFT BRAIN are going to grasp much of it;  but if you keep any audience confused for long enough, (such as is possible when mixing science &  metaphysics,  they'll start to believe they sort of understand you.               Edwards shifts back and forth   between  unscientific New Age  rhetoric and quotes from scientists.   Edwards does not seem to recognize the distinction between Metaphysical Nominalism [WORDS-ARE-NOT-REAL] and Metaphysical Realism [the old Platonic: WORDS-ARE-REAL], and she conveniently ignores the fundamental contradictions of the core assumptions of science and metaphysics that abound in her chapters.         Edwards caters to many who operate with a false assumption:   the   I-CANNOT-DRAW  crowd.   After proving they CAN draw,  the crowd throws aside their crutches and declare themselves healed, and rate the book FIVE STARS.  Notwithstanding,  the FIVE STAR reviewers who laud Edwards with praise,  declare themselves a not very intellectual LEFT BRAIN crowd but praise the RIGHT-BRAIN theory,   OR...what is yet more strange,    flatly refute the RIGHT-BRAIN theory, but praise the book?!?  Here's an example of the latter:      "Instead of using left brain- right brain theory to describe this,  in my view the more correct description would be to learn to access your  SUBCONSCIOUS MIND which functions at a deeper level,  while reducing the way in which your conscious mind interferes with the creative process."  --from a 10 Feb 2005 review on Amazon  [In other words,  the RIGHT-BRAIN theory is totally false;  But what the heck,  let's give the false theory a FIVE STAR rating anyway!]        The missing element here is a fair and objective examination of the claims by some that they "cannot draw".  We are unable to verify these petulant claims. Please understand,  I am not unfamiliar with that feeling and I do not mean to be cruel;  but  the "testimonial"  is the least scientific  and least reliable form of evidence.  Though Edwards cheering section happily declare that they COULD--NOT--DRAW and chant that mantra repeatedly in reviews,  does Betty Edwards support the theory that there are people who CANNOT DRAW?  No,  that is not what Betty Edwards  teaches.  According to an art philosophy website that trumpets her books loudly,  they offer this claim:     ["California State University professor Betty Edwards believes  ANYONE WHO CAN TIE A SHOELACE OR SIGN THEIR NAME CAN LEARN TO DRAW."]   -by Mr. Steve Parr, M. Ed. City University 1996       So Edwards knows there is no such thing as people WHO-CANNOT-DRAW in the first place.    Related to this contradiction is the implied assertion that those who read her book and attend her seminars (and can now "draw")  are somehow..."ARTISTS".  They CAN draw, ergo,  they are "artists".   Of course,  there are no scientific measurements of "artists".  There are also no scientific standards for measuring drawing ability and degrees of drawing  ability.          The website "BRAINY ENCYCLOPEDIA" offers this  pleasant biography and a somewhat positive handling of Edwards books:         ["She proposes exercises to bring out the creative abilities of the right side of the brain,  as opposed to the analytic and logical abilities of the left brain."]  -Brainy Encyclopedia     That only makes sense if her book merely consists of a set of exercises, which it isn't.  How does Edwards do this?  She offers a wordy and overly intellectual LEFT-BRAIN HEAVY book of theories and quotations which constitute  her text,  and to such a degree that only a LEFT-BRAIN predominate person could actually read her work critically.   So much for steering the student away from  "the analytic and logical abilities of the left brain."    The testimonial is great for Multi-Level Marketing,   Pyramid Schemes,  and TV  EVANGELISM,  but falls far short of objective proof.  We have no way of knowing what drawing efforts these individuals put forth prior to self-determining that they CANNOT DRAW.  We don't know what books they studied,  or under what teachers,  or for how long,  or whether they drew with sidewalk chalk,  crayons,  or spray paint.  That does not stop Edwards' groupies from  declaring  their handicap as though it were a medically verified condition of mind or body,  and CONTRADICTING EDWARDS'  AFFIRMATION:      ["California State University professor Betty Edwards believes  ANYONE WHO CAN TIE A SHOELACE OR SIGN THEIR NAME CAN LEARN TO DRAW."]   -by Mr. Steve Parr, M. Ed. City University 1996                With a penchant for   New Age rhetoric it is not surprising that Edwards makes a foray into discussing "Zen" by Chapter 12, entitled,  "The Zen of Drawing Out the Artist Within".  It's a very corny trend in American culture, when you want to baffle the audience,  just mention ZEN,  as though both you and your readers  knew precisely what you are writing about....... the "ZEN" of  something.  It's a very  gooey cosmology,  irrational, and moreover,  irrelevant to art.   Betty Edwards would like to think of herself as the AMERICAN HIGH PRIESTESS OF ZEN BUDDHISM,  after all, don't university professors know EVERYTHING?.   The analogy breaks down when anyone who has studied ZEN for one day finds writings on ZEN  declaring that  ZEN   is   "WITHOUT DOCTRINE" and here's Edwards' book that is a re-hash of every doctrine from Science, and Eastern and Western Religion,  all thrown together as though they pronounce a "Zen" truth,  understood by everybody,  expounded by the Pied Piper of the art world.    I believe the real purpose that this book was written, had something to do with...."The Zen of Drawing Money Out Of Everybody's Wallet",  a very ZENNY  accomplishment I suppose.              I consider book prices on eBay and in other used book vendors as a  "benchmark" of a book's ultimate value.  There are dozens of Betty Edward's  "DRAWING ON  THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN"   dumped on eBay  for prices ranging $.99 to  $5.00  and   HUNDREDS of copies of Edwards books stuck on used book dealers shelves that don't sell, which is a clear indication that the book and its fundamental theory  is a  New Age fad rather than valid art theory.             
 Complaining, whinning, mumbling, beer drinking, bathtub soaking, unattractive Alison and her overgrown, teenage hairstyled, beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter.  The most horrible series I've seen on TV, in the end Alison seems to "solve" whatever the problem is but it's not worth the watch. No one in my family enjoyes this show 
 It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the "War between the States" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey 
 I have used Bach remedies on myself for some time with questionable results, though I sometimes feel some short-lasting benefit. This book appeared to promise to make it easier to select the required remedies,  especially as my symptoms tend to be more psychosomatic than emotional. I  have experienced no effect whatsoever from topical application. My physical  symptoms to do not in any way seem to cluster in the patterns shown in the  book. Also they tend to be symmetrical about the vertical axis of the body,  while in most cases the patterns in the book are asymmetrical. My present  opinion is that this is a work of pure imagination 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 This is an excellent way to learn how to use Aromatherapy.  It gives synergistic blends that can be used for ailments as well as beauty and skin care 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 This is a fine example of a respected intellectual lining up in defense of a difficult-to-justify war and coming out quite convincing.  Of course, to come out quite convincing, Hanson has to resort to some classic and tired old tricks like attacking the protesters of the (then-upcoming Gulf War II), questioning the patriotism of people who dare to question authority, questioning Europe (they can't possibly understand us, he writes, even though we basically came from them), and other howlers.    There are some points here, and some moments where Hanson shows that he may be approaching sense.  This is an educated, intelligent man.  He has notable insights into immigration, and multi-cultural societies, with California (or Mexifornia) as an example of multi-cultural change.  He's very well rounded, and he's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual.    But too often, I found him repeating what I hear on cable TV, the same old lines, the same old tired arguments about the war on terror.  He loves the anti-American argument.  He thinks people 'don't get it', when they complain about the USA but meanwhile want to act and be like Americans.  There are some points to be made here, but too often I found Hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about American greatness and international cluelessness.   I like how he throws out lines like "Second, the Europeans also don't have a clue about America's world role--past, present, or future."  Huh?  I take this to mean that they a) actually don't know any history, or b) don't 'get' our role in history from the American point of view, meaning unconditional support for the world's superpower.  It's funny, of course, considering we as a culture filtered down from Europe.  He settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it' attitude, with the classic, 'why do so many people flock to America?'  I don't think they flock here because they don't like our policy in Iraq, I think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here.  Hanson is either clueless, as is a President who can ask with a straight face, 'why do they hate us?' or he simply knows the answer but...   It's funny, and sad, really, that Hanson, and millions of others still don't seem to 'get it'--namely, that there may actually be a separation between the people, the culture, and values of a country (America) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home.  I guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-American'.    By the time you finish the book, if you can, you might wonder whether Hanson himself believes what he's writing, or if he's an outright cynic.  I guess it doesn't really matter in the end, since if he's a good enough writer, then the effect will be the same.  You may agree with much of what he writes, but on the war on terror, on Bush's pipe dream of bringing democracy to the Middle East, well, he's either buying it (with a wink and nudge), or he's honestly hopeful 
 I have read other novels by Dorothea Frank, and I wasn't expecting too much- only interesting characters and a reasonably interesting plot.  The book was horrible.  While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful.  The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect.  Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues 
 I simply thought that "The Fall of the House of Usher" was rather boring and I found myself dozing off.  I thought that "The Pit and the Pendulum" was a much better flick and a much more interesting adaptation.  In fact, I was quite disappointed with this adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant short story "Fall of the House of Usher".  While the movie provides a grim atmosphere in accordance with the Poe's story, the movie drags and never really picks up enough steam to keep one's interest...however, I found the actual story written by Poe to be quite interesting and very entertaining...perhaps that is my problem with the movie as it is not nearly as good as the story itself.  This movie "The Fall of the House of Usher" could have been much better.  Notwithstanding the poor adaptation of Poe's classic story of despair, Vincent Price, as always, was terrific in his role...still, this is not enough to make this a good adaptation.  I recommend watching the clearly superior "The Pit and the Pendulum" instead of this flick 
 The monographs lack any sort of scientific references.  A true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made 
 Even before I got to the ending I didn't think the story made any sense.  Way too many gaping holes in logic and believable behavior. Then I finished it and nearly threw it in the fireplace. HOW STUPID! It would have been more believable if aliens had been introduced at the end 
 I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange.  I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.  At least they get married at the end of the story.  I took it back to the libray.  Glad I didn't buy it.  I own all the others she wrote however and love them 
 the recipies in this book are plain and uninspired.  they are also inexact.  in the recipie for Tuna Noolde Casarole it calls for a bag of pasta.  What type of pasta? How big a bag.  I put a 1 lb bag of egg noodles in and tried to put it in the recomended size container, didn't fit.  The sauce is also not nearly enough for the quantity (if you use 1 lb of egg noodles) 
 The information in this book is best suited to a physicist with a background in motors. If you don't already have a solid understanding about motors, servos and motor control already, then don't buy this book! The author covers far too much information at a very high level, makes too many assumptions about the reader's knowledge, and does not explain anything in easy-to-understand terms 
 I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this. Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better.  The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help.  It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it.  At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality 
 I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.  
 I've had this product about a month, purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well.  Unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed.  I had to reset the screws (as other reviews for this product have mentioned) - but one screw WOULD not come out.  It was stripped.  A week later, same problem.  I tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week.  Apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand & bag to the base.  This causes either:  a) screws to strip b) the holes to enlarge and warp, meaning screws no longer catch.  Apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit.  Today finally the bag got KO'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws.  I'm a 6'1 220 lb. guy and I'm only using about half of my full force into my punches (again, I hit it just about every day) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use.  I'll call Everlast Monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original 
 After reading the Hiram Key, I was all to excited to run on down to a local store and buy this book.  It is informative to a point, but the author has gone so deep into his own exhaustive personal experience that I found it almost unreadable.  Great author but this book is one to skip unless you prefer absolute tedium. 
 Preparing cow brains and eels might be simple for some, but most will find this a very impractical guide to French cooking. "Pretentious French Food," would be a more appropriate title 
 I purchased this book on the recomendation of a friend.  I found it useless.   It is poorly organized, lacks useful maps and is not well indexed.  It fails to provide any context.  We traveled with friends who had the "The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed", and that is the book to have.  BTW, the free hawaiian music CD that comes with the underground guide is very good 
 I have been a fan of UFO since I was just a kid and a fan of Vinnie since he first blasted onto the scene years ago with a Pepsi commercial.  Who will deny that any one of these musicians is not exceptional?    Any criticism of Vinnie Moore as a guitar player or saying anyone else is "better" is beside the point here.  Moore is truly one of the most impressive guitarists ever.  This album is simply a bad mix.  Not sonically, because the album is well produced.  It's a bad mix of musicians.  Everybody likes ice cream and everybody likes spaghetti - but I don't know anybody who likes ice cream on their spaghetti.  Some things just don't go together.  "You are Here" has a few moments of "OK" but it totally lacks any of the inspiration that a solo Vinnie or old UFO album has.  There are definitely no "Lights Out" or "Hero without Honor" cuts on this album.    I was extremely disappointed to hear a note-for-note recycled solo from a previous Moore record in the very first cut of "You are Here".  Unfortunately, it sets the tone for the rest of the album.  "Jello Man" is just "Midnight Rain" from Moore's 1991 release "Meltdown" - with words added.  Shame on Vinnie and UFO for thinking they could just dust off a bunch of Vinnie's old licks and slide them past his loyal fans.   Sadly, as much as I love both UFO and VM, this album rates a 5 out of 10 - maybe lower depending on your mood.  Production value aside, these guys are capable of much more.  Or is that "much Moore"?  In any event, production value only matters when it is applied to great songs - and great songs are what this album lack 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 a quickly slapped together collection of of this or that book from this or that person - might make a good magazine article but even then, I got nothing out of this book. Also be aware of the viral marketing going on for this book. Sad to say that its become a problem on Amazon 
 I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.         I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund. 
 I bought this heater at Lowe's after returning another Delonghi model to Amazon.  It's great for a bedroom because it is practically silent.  The heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do...allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm.  That was the good news.  The bad news is that after a few months, it broke down.  It turns OFF when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up.  As another reviewer said, it is now an attractive retro paperweight, but that's about it.  I was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having, I'm not going to bother.  After battling with Delonghi over other retro products, I'm giving up.  I won't buy any of their stuff anymore.  By the way, if you want a great, silent heater, try the Bionaire Micathermic model (BNRBH3900U).  It doesn't have the snazzy styling of the Delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year 
 Have to agree with some of the other reviewers.  This isn't the book to get if you're new to smoking foods.  Much better books are out there.  The recipies were fine until I got to the part about how to prepare ribs.  None of the other books I have on smoking would even dare bring up boiling your ribs before placing them on the grill.  Yet, recipe after rib recipe calls for boiling your ribs and then throwing them on the grill.  It's true that boiling will render the fat and make the meat tender but it'll also make it bland.  Why am I harping on this?  Because the real test for quality smoked foods includes ribs (brisket and pork shoulder are the other tests) 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 Ms. McEntire sure likes her music loud and overpowering.  More is not better and this CD could use some toning down because some of the songs are actually pretty good.  Its the overproduction that kills it.  That's why I'm only giving it one star.  Listen to the first track if you don't believe me.  You'll need to take some Excedrin Migraine after it.  
 If you have an older 3 year old or young 4 year old who needs potty training this is a good sticker pack.  The stickers have phrases on them, like; wiped by myself, remembered to wash hands, was dry, etc.  If you have a younger potty trainer, save your money and buy some smiley face stickers, or character themed stickers your child will enjoy placing on a potty chart. Toys-R-Us carries cartoon character sticker packs. Good luck shopping! 
 i find this book boring   full of theories instead of giving examples. 
 Claremont is totally washed up.  I'd compare everything he's written in the past 5 or 6 years since coming back to X-Men to what it would be like to watch a bunch of 60-70 year old hall of fame professional athletes come back and play against a current batch of all stars.  He used to have the stuff, but he's spent.  I've read better fan fic than the overexpository horribly rambling and dated dialogue that he puts out.  Sometimes it's better to go out on top of your game.  Obviously Claremont doesn't agree 
 As an Amazon reviewer, I have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that I have listened to that is worth reviewing. More often than not, I will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who haven't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it. However, I believe I have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it. Chingy never was very talented, whether lyrically or flow-wise, but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use, helping make some of the song more listenable. But his follow-up is...well, how can I describe while also being nice...unmitigated crap. There, I used a big word in an attempt to be nice. Even if you're into the whole "cash-money-hoes" pop rap that's been overtaking the mainstream, this album won't do a thing for you. Some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young "hood" life experiences to make it their own, but Chingy, other than his nasaly, thick accent, does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album. All that this album offers is more generic "I'm rich so I'll flaunt it until you puke" crap. Worse, the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the "music". I don't even know if you can call this music, as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down. Chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise. I can't believe I once even listened to this guy. It makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all. He and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives. And for the love of God, Chingy, LEARN TO SPELL! You're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and "Fall'N". I don't see what's so hard about spelling those right. Here's a short lesson: "WHERE ARE THE GET IT GIRLS?" and "FALLING", My god, you can't even spell simple words right.  Bottom line: there is no reason why you should buy this album. Like I said, even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms, you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once. You'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full CD price for such a worthless waste of materials. For rap that actually warrants more than one listen, try Busdriver or Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow. For good music in general, listen to great metal bands like Children of Bodom and Blind Guardian, and maybe even some classical composers like Dvorak and Beethoven. Those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than Chingy has in his whole body. This CD gets no points whatsoever. I would also give 0 stars to it, but Amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there's at least a shred of quality on it, but this album doesn't even deserve it.  0/1 
 Loved the VHS version of this film.  Tried 3 different DVD versions none of which would play on my 2 DVD players or my computer.  Stick with the VHS version 
 The book is for beginners.  It doesn't offer anything new or useful to experienced investors--women or men.  Waste of time 
 Admittedly, I have not read this book, but I stumbled upon her slideshow/lecture on campus recently, and I definitely do not plan to persue her theory.  The connections between sex and meat in the advertising industry seem rather obvious to me.  I guess it's nice that she's been devoting so much time to collecting these images, but it's really not anything terribly enlightening.  Her approach is not very academic, she has invented some pseudo-intellectual "A" and "not-A" categorization, which is again, rather elementary.  (Granted, I saw Judith Butler speak the same evening, so the contrast was all the more painful).  After her lecture, she was outright rude to a man who wished to respectfully argue with her, then proceeded to push the Bible as her underlying evidence that animals have souls and we should not eat them.  Also, her sense of feminism leans a lot more toward femi-nazi-ism, aka one of those feminists who tries to make it a life style rather than a political movement, aka she probably thinks porn is inherently degrading to women.  Anyway, as a feminist (in the legal gender equality sense) NON-Christian pescatarian, I was hoping her lecture would be an interesting academic arguement, but I was seriously disappointed.  She really gives feminist vegetarians a bad name 
 I have never felt as compelled to write an online review of a product as I do right now...  First of all, the very title of this book is blatantly misleading.  And I believe this was intentional.  This isn't the science OF superheroes, this is the science AGAINST superheroes.  (Well, it is against all of them except the X-Men, but we'll get into that one in a bit.)  What the authors have done here is taken what could have potentially been a fun little ride through the land of superheroes, and turned it into a mean spirited trek through your most boring physics class.  After reading the title, you might expect to see a book describing the scientific aspects of how superheroes exist and function.  But you would be wrong.  Instead, the authors go well out of their way to disprove any notion that superheroes could exist.  I believe this was intentionally given a misleading title because they knew someone interested in superheroes would not be buying a book saying they are impossible.  I mean, come on... we all know they are impossible, be we would like to see science that shows what might be possible.  But this book does none of that.  This book is only about ripping the superhero genre to shreds.  Not only is the book 99% negative, but it is written in a way that is very degrading to fans of superhero based comic books.  Like other reviewers have said, it is as though the authors are just trying to bash comic books and fans of them.  Reading this book gives you the feeling that they would just love to tell us "Are you stupid?  Don't you realise this is impossible?!?"  The science isn't entirely accurate either.  For all of the looking down their noses at us that they do, these two enlightened people don't exactly have all their facts straight.  For example, in the chapter about Henry Pym, they describe how a person that is getting larger would actually become weaker with size, so that eventually he would not even be able to support his own weight.  So that means that my 36 year old body is impossible because I am alot bigger than I was when I was 5.  But yet, here I am.  Heck, maybe I'm a superhero...  I guess dinosaurs were impossible too, because they were pretty doggone big.  The authors also say that Pym shrinking down to ant size would increase his relative strength tremendously.  If this would be the case, at 5'-11" I can lift my own weight so that would mean that a person significantly smaller than me, such as a midget, should be able to lift many time his/her own weight.  I don't think so....  Now, the famous X-Men chapter...  As a believer in the Bible, I am deeply offended by this chapter.  Not one single scientific fact was made about the X-Men.  NOT A SINGLE ONE.  Instead, the authors used this chapter as a soapbox to deliver a long tirade about how they think Creationists are trying to deceive the world about our origins.  They go on to say that everyone who believes in Creationism thinks that the world was created on October 22, 4004 BCE!!!  Let me tell you, I believe that God created the Universe, but I have never heard this mess about October 22, 4004 BCE.  Through this entire chapter, they do nothing but ridicule and insult people who believe in God and Creation.  Then to top it all off, they end the chapter by saying the X-Men are not only possible, but probable in our future!!!!  So, we get to look forward to guys shooting lasers our of their eyes, people controlling the weather with their minds, people who can morph into perfect copies of other people, not to mention others who can walk through walls, freeze moisture in the air, shoot fire from their hands, etc... Hey, the authors said all this is probably going to happen in our future!!  (sigh)  This chapter alone was enough to make me stop reading this book.  It was not a very enjoyable read to begin with, but once I got to the end of the X-Men chapter I had enough.  And from other reviews, I see that the authors think Donald Duck is the shining example of a good scientific comic book.  As one other reviewer said... Talking Ducks....  To sum it all up, I don't see that there is any market for this book.  People wanting to know the science behind their favorite superhero are not going to enjoy this book because they will find out that nothing supports their favorite character, unless that character just happens to be blue and can teleport with a BAMF sound, which in that case the authors say that is entirely probable.  People who are not interested in superheroes are not going to buy this book for obvious reasons.  So who does that leave as the target audience of this book??  No one.  And that is exactly who I would recommend this book to 
 I guess success turned around for Sam Raimi in 2002 & 2004 with the two Spider-Man films, but first he created this "V" like character in this garage of a movie, I liked "V for Vendetta" but not this "Darkman" if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see "V for Vendetta" don't see "Darkman 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  It is not written or illustrated by the creators of the Magic School Bus series and it is obvious from page one.  There are none of the informative side bars (papers, etc. "written" by the kids in the story) and the information is not as complete.  This alone makes the book less appealing than the originals, but to top it off, the children in the book bicker and compete with each other and are not supportive or respectful.  
 First, the thesis of The God Code is an intriguing one. I applaud new and creative ideas that attempt to meld science and spirituality. Nonetheless, some aspects of the book I found a bit difficult to get down with. Some of these one could reasonably expect an editor or proofreaders to catch, as accidental typos and incorrect transcriptions do happen. There are several in this text. Without tiring you with a list, let me give one example: on page 16, Braden states Pioneer 10 is almost 11 light years away, and then he writes it took 11 hours to send a signal to it from Earth. Nothing humans are apt to use travels faster than the speed of light, so the existence of any signal that could reduce the amount of time it takes light to travel in one year to the space of only an hour is truly questionable.  At times Braden had to rely on other experts in telling his story. The feedback he received on evolution certainly was not as precise as it could have been. First, even though he treats creationism and evolution as competing theories, it must be noted that a scientific theory is not the same as the way "theory" is used in the vernacular. So although one can refer to creationism "theory" in conversation, to put it in the same sentence with evolutionary theory may mislead some readers who do not beforehand understand the difference between scientific theory and a conjecture. Generally, scientific theory is not only testable, but has more or less passed every test to which it has been subjected. That it may need modification from time to time-or be incomplete-does not place it in the same category as belief or faith or hypothesis or revelation.  Speaking of evolution, yes, the evidence does appear to support it. Braden's questioning of evolutionary premises seems based on a few assumptions that are not even in the theory. For instance, new forms of life do not "descend" from others per se as he suggests the theory claims. Evolution does not proceed in a line, but is rather a motley series of disparate forms resulting from what appears to be almost random motion away from simple beginnings toward forms where more complexity may or may not be present. Increasing complexity is an incidental consequence of natural selection. After all, bacteria still dominate on almost every level. Life appears to seek ways to reproduce itself, period. Sometimes more complex life forms do develop from other life forms (as they secure new niches in which to prosper), but more complexity is not always advantageous.  Another point: even though Braden appears to suggest otherwise, species can and do co-exist, even if one apparently provided the basis for another. There is a huge number of such examples in nature. Further, there is no reason to assume humans should have evolved other species by now simply because our genotype has been around for 160,000 to 200,000 years. Plenty of species have been around essentially unchanged for millions of years, and this is not a problem for the theory of natural selection (for to be more precise, evolution is the fact and natural selection is the corresponding theory).  I found his analysis of the "God code" itself interesting, but not compelling. I do not say that to be disparaging, because I know that the advancement of human knowledge often begins in flights of fancy. However, as Braden takes his logical leaps, some things stand out. Let's just accept for a moment that his conversion of "atomic mass" to what he calls "simple mass" is a logical progression. Given that (and that is a stretch), the atomic mass of oxygen is 15.99, which converts to 16, not 15 as he states. That gives us Z, not V (in the charts he provides). This may not invalidate his argument, depending on the meaning and history of Z, but he doesn't even address Z.  Furthermore, I believe Figure 6.5 needs further development or explication. As it is, it adds nothing to the discussion. I would have found an analysis of the chart in Appendix C much more enlightening (e.g., how the number of atoms in each DNA base relate to the numbers in the God code). Perhaps that is a subject for future writing?  A couple more nit-picks. Throughout the text, he often uses "while" when he actually means "although." I realize new uses for words become more acceptable in writing as people insist continue to use words incorrectly in conversation and informal prose. My favorite example not in this book (and mind you I understand it is simply an example of how language develops and changes) is the ubiquitous current use of "impact" as a verb. For all I know, "while" can now correctly be used in place of "although," but my publication manual still draws a distinction. The other irritant is the man uses way more exclamation points in this book than any school girl would. 
 Stop me if you've heard this one:   So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world.   They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the "heathens" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany.   It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of "Hogan's Heroes," but it makes a lousy book.  Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another.   
 Cleary, no one ever taught Mr. Freehling to do research!  This is the most asinine book ever written about the "late unpleasantness."  First, the states of the Upper South were definately NOT Anti-Confederate!  Anyone who claims as much has lacked the historical studies to pass a history class, let alone have a book published which some will take seriously!  Lincoln arrested Secessionists in Maryland, which kept the state from seceding from the Union.  And, both Missouri and Kentucky joined the Confederacy late in 1861.  There are 13 stars on the Confederate flag, there were 13 Secessions, and 13 states of the Confederacy.  Missouri and Kentucky were, though, occupied throughout the war, with Kentucky being liberated briefly during the war.  This book lacks consistency, and perpetuates a biased and untrue history [someone should think of our children when they write this garbage].  If I had the capabilities of giving it no stars in a rating, I would enthusiastically do so.  Don't buy this book, look for another 
 I think this film wants to make you vomit. I don't know about you, but that is not a quality I am looking for in my films. Being scared is fine; being in suspense is great, vomiting is not. I really think that is what this film was going for. It has some pretty disgusting moments. While I was watching it I kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes. In fact, I am feeling it now as I write this review and think about the movie.  The story runs like this: A meteor falls to earth. It has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device. This of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation...well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine. In the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into rotting-corpse looking creatures, or in the case of the head alien, just a big pile of disgustingness.  The idea itself isn't a bad one, and its executed in a relatively skillful way. In fact, the idea is much more original than many other horror movies. But as I said before, it's just too disgusting to be really enjoyable. This movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
   The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 While the product is what I wanted, the shipping was too late.  The original shipping indicated that I should have received my pepper in time, but the shipper got the product to UPS late, therefore, I didn't get to use the pepper in the recipe and now I'll have to wait for another time to use it 
 ok so i've never read this book, but if you need a book to navigate amazon.com, then you should just give me your money instead.  I mean, I know it's hard to type a word and press enter, and then press buy; i think the real difficulty of amazon.com is how the author managed to write XXX pages about navigating amazon.com.  Having said that, it almost makes me want to buy this book, so I'm changing my 1 Star to 2.  
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 I dont think there was a single program that didnt have bug in it.  Bugs in the programs.  Bugs in the deployment descriptors. Typos and wrong statements in the text.   You need to check each and every program, line-by-line, against the updated code which must be downloaded from SAM's website.  Your weblogic 30-day trial licence will expire before you finish slogging through this book 
 I adore Katherine Forrest's mysteries and Curious Wine is simply exquisite and I'm an SF fan, so it seemed like this would be a perfect match, but I'm afraid to say this novel was very disappointing. It felt very dated and cliche. The story moved at an insane speed with little or no support for some jumps of plot and logic. A good SF novel uses the alternative setting to free readers from expectations, but needs to have a logic in and of itself, but this felt like the SF backdrop was an excuse for implausable deus ex machina jumps in the plot. Very much "it doesn't have to make sense, it's SF." Still, this is a classic of lesbian feminist utopian fiction and it was worth reading on that level 
 I love DCD and have since the mid 80's.  Maybe I am missing the point of a tribute album, because this album, while okay, offers nothing new, musically or emotionally.  I was hoping that some talented artist world interpret the music and soul of these songs for themselves - and in turn share with us a new perspective and a new experience.  But instead all that is here are some simplistic renditions and uninviting covers.  What bothered me the most are the pieces where the tribute band did everything they could (vocals and instruments) to sound just like DCD.  My first comment would be... `not possible', and the second would be `Why' even if you could???  I can see the enjoyment from the musician's point of view of playing the music the same as DCD did, but not as the one who is listening!  The few songs where the artists took the music and made it their own were much more enjoyable for me, but there is just not enough of that here.  Mostly the music is just murky shadows of the real thing 
 So much for revealing the "secrets" of Cabales Escrima. Unfortunatly this book is quite the opposite. Wiley misquotes Angel on the back cover. Angel gave permission for a series of books on Cabales Serrada Escrima - Not just one book with all the good techniques left out. I'm sure the Grand Master would have been bitterly dissapointed with this effort by Wiley. The idea was to spread the knowledge of this fantastic system throughout the world in its entirety through a series of books - Not for an insecure person to greedily hoard the techniques for himself to reveal at seminars and private tuition. 
 I have read any other reviews, so here's what I have to this. Quite simply, this book sucks. I had to read it this year at the age of 15, and let me tell you, everything McGraw says is wrong. He is sexist, stereotypical, and a total jerk. He has an entire chapter devoted to saying "You must be one of these things: A stupid jock, a slut, a nerd, a tease or a pothead" He never thinks to mention that you don't have to be confined to these categories. Heck, the smartest kid in our grade is an all star athlete that plays basketball, soccer and baseball. And that's out of 663 kids. He talks down to teens like he knows everything about the world, but he was only 18 or so when it was published. Being Dr. Phil's son doesn't make him smarter or better than the rest of us. If he believes any of that crap he spews out throughout the book, I feel very sorry for him. I personally think daddy wanted his son to get a job so he decided to capitalize on the "I don't understand my kids!" syndrome. Don't get this book, it's a waste of your time.  
 Would have given "0" stars on this one.  Boring and lacks any direction 
 It was a nice idea and the large black bowl makes an attractive centerpiece but soothing, comforting it is not. In operation, the floating chimes miss 4 out of 6 stationary chimes producing a monotonous, high pitched tone. The floating chimes can get stuck as they travel around the bowl. Not a nice feature unless you like having to jump up to free them. For the price, it is just not a quality product. Yankee's Customer Service is not sympathetic to the product's flaws. They just offer to replace it with another ill-designed unit. Save yourself the trouble and buy elsewhere. There are plenty of decent fountains that do work as promised even if they don't chime 
 Well written but dodges every touchy issue. Womens rights, minorities etc. One thing is to say how things ought to be and another to explain why things are the way they are.  
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 Unlike most of the reviewers here, I come from a different starting place. I knew Margaret Murray. She lived to be a hundred years old and died in 1963. It's a shame that she's known mostly now for her books on witches. She was an Egyptologist and did valuable work back in the late 1890's with Sir Matthew Finders Petrie.  This book is not one of her best. She was cantankerous to say the least. She would agree with me, if she were able. Sorry, Margaret.... 
 No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work!  Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits.  What a disappointment 
 This book is utter nonsense.  Spoon bending? The author, Dean Radin, fell for spoon bending??? (see endnote 1 on page 331). Sorry, but given that, his credibility is zero or less. (Spoon bending was totally discredited and shown to be a complete fraud more than 30 years ago by Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman.) Just as bad, Radin can only offer lame excuses (page 290) for not pursuing some of the many prizes that are being offered for a valid, definitive demonstration of psi. (If the evidence is as strong as Radin claims, he should have already walked home with several of these prizes.)  Radin complains that he'd have to spend more than a million in order to win the million dollar prize James Randi is offering.  But all Radin would have to do is demonstrate his spoon bending ability under scientific conditions.  If Radin can bend spoons as he claims, it should be an easy million for him.  
 More crap from Plimpton, the very definition of athletic supporte 
 This is merely an introduction to Active Release Therapy and its potential in the treatment of Repetitive Strain Injuries.  There is NO INSTRUCTION on how to apply ART.  Consider it promotional material for Dr. Leahy .  The bulk of the book is made up of an overview of common Injuries (causes, treatment options, selected exercises and stretches). One has to train and test with the author to become an ART practitioner 
 I've used the Schick Quattro for about 3 years now and have been happy with it.  I thought I would try out this powered M3 razor to see what all the hype was about.  Many of my friends said they got the best shave ever using it: No razor burn, bumps, or nicks etc.  However, the M3 gave me more razor burn and nicks than any razor I've ever used! Could it have been that I wasn't used to the Mach 3 blades after using a Quattro for years?  To rule out blade differences, I subsequently tried the Power Quattro and obtained similar, albeit less drastic, negative results.    In particular, both the M3 and Power Quattro really did a number on my neck area.  I even had people comment on how abused my neck looked after shaving with these two razors.  Both Gillette and Schick assert that vibrations diminish irritation and lead to a superior shave.  In my case, I believe that vibrations actually lead to more irritation!  My personal experience with these razors, and my cynical nature, lead me to believe that vibrating razors are just another ploy by the shaving industry to get people to buy more product (i.e., aftershave creams and lotions to cover up the mess that such razors create).    My advice is to avoid these powered hybrids alltogether and stick with a regular Quattro or Mach 3 razor. 
 There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book.  We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists.  Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are:  Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair  If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley  Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage by Anne Kristin Carroll   They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband 
 I have long heard the name of Samuel Beckett, along with Yeats, Bernard Shaw and Heaney as the 4 most distinguished writers of Ireland. But Beckett's plays in this book are a total disappointment! For shoppers who are reading this review, you may disagree with my rating of this book, but you have to agree that the plays in this book can (might) only be appreciated through watching them being acted out, and not just by reading the scripts.  I don't understand the plays in this book at all, except for the very first one - All That Fall.  For those who like Eugene O'Neill and such, and not absurdity, please do not try this book.  This is definitely not worth US$15.95!  Maybe just US$1.95, for All That Fall. 
 I bristle at the suggestion that perhaps Roosevelt knew of the attack but did nothing to stop it, as if a repulsed sneak attack would not have convinced America to go to war.  The conspiracy theory holds that Roosevelt had the carriers shipped out of Pearl, leaving the obsolete battleships to be destroyed in the attack.  The one glaring problem with this theory (actually there are several problems, but I consider this the most compelling) can be summarized in a single word: oil.  A HUGE amount of oil was stored at Pearl, such a huge amount in fact that the carriers and subs would have been out of action probably for an entire year, if the oil had been destroyed.  The value of that oil was tremendous, and Roosevelt would have been absolutely demented to risk it.  It was pure luck that the Japanese did not target it (they actually planned to hit it on the aborted third run).  Additionally, Roosevelt was a former Navy Secretary who referred to the Army as "them" and the Navy as "us".  It is way beyond belief that he would have sacrificed the battleships and their crews, much less the oil.  It's always sooooo simple to monday morning quarterback, a lesson to keep in mind today regarding Iraqi WMD 
 This is an ok atlas for neuro anatomy but I found it lacked some pathways. However, what it does have in pathways is fairly clear and concise. Still, the slides lack clarity so some stuff is hard to understand 
 I have to disagree with preceding 5 star reviews; this is one of Putumayo's more dubious compilations. (On this note, I must also say here that Putumayo's compilations - of which I have many - are sometimes patchy notwithstanding cool packaging. While some are clearly 5 star material, others occasionally include duds and also ignore some tremendous local/ethnic talent who are big in their home countries; Putumayo also titles albums according to apparently hip but essentially dumbed down commercial thematics. For example...Just because lounge is cool and sexy nowadays doesn't mean anything goes)... Anyway, back to this one...it starts well and chugs along nicely till about the 80 per cent mark when it starts to falter in terms of track/artiste selection. I find it difficult to believe there is such a dearth of lounge mixes in the north African/Middle East genre that Putumayo had to include track 12 - a verson of Lily Marlene remixed and attributed to Lebanon - which is frankly a bit of a bad joke. Sorry Mr Storper, you tripped near the finish on this one!   
 George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, "Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise" and "Arizona Sunrise."  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, "Take You Out" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the "Forever, For Always, For Luther" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition "Take You Out."  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not "Irreplaceable."  
 If you enjoy good literature give this one a pass.  This book is trite, boring, predicatable and cliche.  There is nothing new or noteworthy about Mr. Pezzeli's prose.  Striclty dullsville 
  For those considering the purchase of this unit, keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your Tv. Menus and playlists will not.The very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable isn't worth it. Get some 10.00 cables for your ipod and save  mone 
 I love funky beats and bass lines but this is too repetitive and lacking any heart. Great as background music but not good for much else 
 I hate having music mixed with my nature sounds. I really hate bad music mixed with my nature sounds. Save your money and buy something else that's worth it. THIS IS NOT RELAXING 
 I haven't received this product but you're asking me for a review?? Suggest you check your shipping records!! I still want it but haven't received it to date 
 If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.  Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 A good "companion" book to Sandman would tell you about Neil Gaiman's thousands of sources for his stories.  Who is Lyta Hall in the DC universe?  Who is Element Girl?  How about literary and historical sources?  Where does the phrase "omnia mutantur, nihil interit" come from, who used it, and what did it mean then?  Who was Aleister Crowley?  Instead, most of this book is a recap of the story -- Cliff's Notes for a comic -- with a few visits from Neil talking about the inspiration for this or that!  Very disappointing.  Not worth the money 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer.  The combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining.    Many people love this video but I just had a bad experience with it 
 What a shame.  Dianne Reeves may have the best voice in jazz today, but in this CD every song is over produced, arranged, and most sadly, oversung.  Anyone who has listened to Ms. Reeves sing knows she has great vocal ability, but it feels like this is an attempt to see how stylized and how much vocal gymnastics she can wow us with.  From the original songs (which are awful and should never be a part of the best of, to the couple of standards which again are over arranged (and over the top with vocalization), this CD was totally disapointing.  You want to hear the best of Diane Reeves, get the soundtract to "Good Night and Good Luck" as this is truley an artist at the top of her vocal game with great arrangments of wonderful songs 
 If you've read Kroeger and Thusen's other books, like "Type Talk At Work" or "Type Talk", you'll recognize most of that material in this book.  "16 Ways To Lover Your Lover" doesn't add much to  the two works mentioned above, and if you are well read on the MBTI this  book won't add much to what you already know.  However, if Type is new to  you, and you're looking for some fun ways to explore your relationship with  a significant other, this book is worth a shot 
 I always use this book as an example of what's wrong with much of the humanities. I hope people who take this stuff seriously take the time to read some rebuttals. The fact that "truth" is a philosophically difficult concept really doesn't in any way change the spectacular achievements of the scientific method. That most of the foundations of science were built by white males is a historical accident. The discoverers of deep science may have benefited from a twisted social order, but the whole world has benefited from their work. More to the point, Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws would not be substantially different if discovered by a Balinese woman, they would just have a different name. No amount of pseudointellectual babble will change that. It's, sorry, a fact 
 Like a train wreck, one wants to not look, but at the same time cannot help but be fascinated with the horrific sight.  Such is the musical career of Smoov-E.  Hearlded by his local paper with, "the debut CD would actually be funny as a parody, if only it were."  Little, if any, has changed since then.  Give the preview tracks a listen and a hearty laugh 
 Everyone, avoid buying this book.  There are many other books out there.  As you can see on this page, one of the authors of this book tried to justify having made errors by saying other books have errors too.  He also openly admitted having made contextual errors (which is extremely embarrassing) after being pointed out by one of his customers, but the author blasted him away and made no apology about selling incorrect data due to his ignorance and stupidity.  
 I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use.  The quality was not good, but, the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with.  It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped.  i have had every excuse imaginable, first they wanted me to pay for shipping, then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun, then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model.  i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced.  i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress.  the worst customer service of all time! 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 If you have had no experience in education or training, then this book can provide a simple overview (as the title implies).  However, this book isn't entirely up-to-date in its compare/contrast of training & education, the differences in pedagogy & andragogy, and best practice for learning.  Don't expect fresh ideas for keeping trainees engaged 
 I know. I know. There aren't a lot of lesbian books and films out there so the insatiable public is supposed to embrace the few that do get published for consumption with enthusiasm. However, this dvd just did not rate way up there with Fingersmith--which was incredible. Buy that instead if you must spend your hard earned cash 
 I orginally purchased this for myself when it was $10.  As soon as I received it I went to put it on and it broke right away.  I was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for $10.  I went to put that one on and it broke as well.  I was never able to wear the necklace even once.  I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!!! 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 I've read it. I wish I hadn't The illos are nice, but the backstory makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.  Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see  the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS. 
 Even a supporter of Bush will see no purpose for it. Non-supporters will see it for what it is - pure propaganda.  Just one of so many books that represent a waste of good trees.       
 A friend of mine works for an petrochemical exploration company.  They specialize in determining potential locations of oil deposits by drilling cores into layers of sedimentary deposits and looking at the evolutionary sequences of micro-fossils which were accumulated millions of years ago on ancient sea-floors. Oil (and coal) deposits formed when decaying plant matter became buried under sediments and underwent subsequent chemical alteration.  The plant material requires millions of years to be converted into oil or coal. (They're called fossil fuel for a reason, you know.)  When you analyze a drill core sample, and if you find particular micro-fossils of species that only lived during a certain geological age that corresponds to the age when oil deposits formed, then you might be in an area where oil can be found.  Her company gets contacts from huge oil companies to help them make multi-billion dollar decisions on where to drill for oil based partly on the information obtained by looking at micro-fossils.  Oil companies have been doing this for decades. Don't believe me.  Find out for yourself.  Search the internet for websites about oil exploration micropaleontology.  Next time you fill your tank, consider the role evolution played in both the creation and the discovery of the gas you're pumping into your car.  I own stock in the company my friend works for and have made some nice returns on it.  I also have a relative who works for a medical research institute that uses DNA analysis to find out how viruses and genetic defects cause disease.  He's working on therapies for several types of cancer.  They use genetic mutations and evolutionary histories of diseases to understand how cells, viruses and diseases operate.  They've already had success with some drugs and I've made money off of a drug company's stock as a result.  The science is way over my head.  However, based on the logic of this book, you have to conclude that genetic mutations can't be studied with any certainty because it seems they can occur only if and when God wants them to.  I don't know how I'll be able to break it to him but I guess someone will have to tell him that his research is simply a waste of time.  I know that seems at odds with the fact I've made money off the stock market . . . but Phillip Johnson wants me to have an open mind after all, and, let's face it, he's so much smarter than these people.  I can't imagine how insulting it must be to intelligent, dedicated, highly educated, hard working, honest, professional people like these, who use the principles of evolution in their day to day work, in billion dollar industries, for them to hear people say that evolution didn't happen or that it is just an ideology. (I should sell the stock in these companies soon, before they crash when word gets out that evolution is a myth.)  Folks, there is a tremendous amount of information supporting evolution. In all honesty, it is downright silly to contend at this point that living things have not evolved over the eons.  It is simply a fact of life.  It is not a religious belief or an opinion.  I urge you to truly inform yourselves about evolution from sources other than creationists or  IDers or whatever they call themselves.  Look at the depth and detail of information supporting evolution.  There are many websites about it. Check them out.  Look at some professional research journals on subjects related to biology, geology, palenotology, etc.  Ask yourself, "Can this tremendous amount of detailed information accumulated by researchers for hundreds of years really be fake or incorrect?"  "Are all the thousands of highly intelligent, highly educated people around the world who are currently conducting research on evolution, as well as those using it in their daily work, all wrong?"  "Would scientists at the most prestigious universities in the world really deliberately lie about this?"  "Why would they risk being caught in a lie and ruin their professional careers?"  Please, be realistic about science.  And, by the way, you can be Christian and fully accept evolution.  I do.  So do the friend and relative I mentioned above.  Of course, I guess we're just closed-minded. 
 I had very high hopes for this book due to its title and was looking for how to more cohesively merge Buddhism with management in modern corporate America. My experience is that this book neither explained Buddhism correctly nor did it give good management principles. It was just some light reading and common sense. The meditation exercises at the end of the book were strange discussing different colors of light and using the four elements in meditation all that is needed is to focus on the breathe and observe thoughts without losing yourself in them, that is true meditation, simply sit. This book also focused to much time and effort on the self,which is the very thing we should be overcoming. This is a poor book on Buddhism and management.Keep Looking. 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 This text is very eccentric. I had to read it for an English class, and there was a mix of different reviews. Some loved it, some hated. I myself could not get through all of it (though I did make it to page 223). I suppose that the best way to tackle this novel is to realize that narrative is a big part of it, as well as is magic realism. The line between fact and fiction almost does not exist here. Logic cannot be applied when reading this novel. What is fact, what is fiction? Try to not distinguish the two while reading it and you may find yourself getting through it much more smoothly than I did. 
 I fall asleep at every single chapter. I think that it's meant for older people AND as a torturing device for high school students! (AHS -I hate summer assignments!) I mean, come on! We're only rising 11th graders! This kind of stuff doesn't interest most of us yet 
 If you're looking for a book that was mostly written by someone other than Kendra, has information about housing markets that is outdated, and overall seems like a free seminar at a cheap hotel, then this book is for you.  
 very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again 
 Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album.  Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good.  In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album.  Now to this album, "the new one".  You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album.  What the hell was going on?  Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song?  Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it.  Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!!  Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 This book held a lot of good information as a reference volume, but it made for VERY dry reading.  It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed.  It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters.  I find that by the time I get to a second mention of a myth or regional story, I've forgotten what I read about it in a previous chapter!  It is especially not a good book for a beginner just trying to get an overview of older pagan traditions 
 Based on what I read about the book, I thought I would be getting a detailed explanation and "user guide" for incorporating sprint work into my workouts.  But there wasn't much there that I didn't already know.  Far too many useless photos, too 
 This book was a chore to read, too slow, too cluttered and the love interests weren't even interested in each other much less showing any personality.  The people never came out of the book they were flat and pathetic.  I am an avid reader, and enjoy books that include the supernatural.  It is pretty hard to make a vampire as dull and numbing as this one was.  If you are interested in something interesting with a twist of the supernatural I would recommend that to read Laurell K. Hamilton or Christine Feehan over this particular author 
 I had to finish this for my book club, but it was laborious.  I kept thinking that this was Amy Tan's "A Painted House" (Grisham) -- the novel that wouldn't have been published by any other author....  Where were the descriptions, the people we care about, the plot?  I felt as though I were  trapped on that boring busride for 200 pages, and then forced to watch  CNN for the next 100, and the final 100 was her summary of each character's life.  What was the purpose? 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 This novel began as a short story published in an anthology titled The Dragon Quintet.  It was the best of the collection and when I learned that Lackey had decided to use it as the basis for a novel, I was delighted.  Within a short time, I had a copy of the novel in hand and looked forward to reading it.  The reality was less than the anticipation.  The first 108 pages encompass one day in the life of Vetch, the 10-year-old boy who is the protagonist of the story.  Now, we all know how much energy children can have, but this lad accomplishes more in this one day than most people can get done in a week.  He also has the wisdom of the ages and tends to repeates himself incessantly, especially when he is judging others.  In this latter regard, good editing and tightening would have been of great benefit.  One does not have to get very far into this story to recognize the references to ancient Egyptian culture, history, and mythology.  Unfortunately, these references are neither strong enough nor slight enough to actually work.  Instead they are something of an irritant:  either be Egyptian or don't 
 What a boring book this is. i have always felt like falling asleep. The whole book just keep talking about the same point that i have already known. But the way the story is told just like it's a surpring fact. i don't understand why this book is worth reading and interesting. i think it's so boring. What is interesting is he spent such a long time wrting a boring book 
 Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television 
 Jody Stephens thought Ken Stringfellow and Jon Aur would be good for a Big Star reunion.  Bad idea!  The two guys from The Posies make Big Star sound like fluff.  Big Star In Space ruins the reputation and legend of Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens.  There are better choices for musicians to become part of a Big Star reunion.  Alex and Jody should give the two posies the boot and start from scratch.  There is still a masterpiece Big Star album waiting to be written, recorded and released.  In Space is an embarrassment compared to the songs and musicianship of # 1 Record and Radio City.  Save your money and order vinyl copies of Big Stars early albums from Acoustic Sounds.  I got Radio City and # 1 Record on vinyl and they sound incredible.  
 The authors have so much enthusiasm for their topic that I truly wanted to write a positive review, but unfortunately their enthusiasm is the only redeeming quality of the book. True, you can learn some things about searching for gold with a metal detector. And although the authors disclaim any purpose to sell their products, they refer to them exclusively on the grounds that they are most familiar with them. Well, OK, but it still has an uncomfortable feel to it. And I felt I was unable to translate many of their instructions to generic terms (for use with any brand metal detector).  Early on you are advised that terms are defined in the glossary. But they should also be defined in the text so that one does not have to continually stop reading and refer to the glossary. This is basic to didactic writing. For example, the term "placer" is used many times before it is defined. Ground balancing (canceling) is treated the same way.   There are several passages that are repeated verbatim in different chapters and you are left wondering if you have somehow read the current chapter already! It appears that the editor of the book was in a great rush, or extremely inexperienced. I could not find any reference to RAM publications on the web. The editor was found, and seems to be mostly associated with the works of Garret and Lagal.  Was it worth the price? I suppose, as I at least felt the excitement of hunting for gold. But it would be better titled as a companion to one of the Garret manufactured metal detectors.  I still hope to find a book on using the metal detector as a hobby that is a better-written "how to" book that speaks in generic terms about metal detectors.  
  This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it!  Anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing.  What was the point of the story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird. There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was shocked. And I'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, I have an open mind. But this book left me cold 
 After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.    "Anthropophagus" may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes, so the gore-hound shouldn't be disappointed with this flick.  However, with that being said, "Anthropophagus" simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience, and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love.  Ultimately, what you have in "Anthropophagus" is horrible acting, a poorly written screenplay, uneven and poorly developed plot and action, below average plot execution, just a couple of scary moments, some laughable scenes, a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting, deplorable and depraved scene of violence (fetus scene) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that I've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror.  If that kind of thing appeals to you, this could be right up your alley, but it doesn't do much for me.  I would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension, suspense and a scary story, and you simply do not get that in "Anthropophagus".  To answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie...did "Anthropophagus" bother me? No.  Did I think it was scary?  Certainly not, laughable at some points in the movie but not scary, and nor did I find it disturbing.  However, it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget Italian-made horror flick? Touche!    In my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack, what did I find in "Anthropophagus" but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline.  Indeed, it is very difficult to give this movie any credit.  A word of advice, if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings (like I did with this one), it probably just sucks.  For all intents and purposes, that is the case with "Anthropophagus-The Grim Reaper".  Nevertheless, sadly, I've seen much, much worse. 
 I really expected more. Rhino, the author of the Stiff Records and 'Left of the Dial' box sets and the 'Just Can't Get Enough' series assembled this tired set of eighties new wave? Wow.  A third of this CD has been anthologized to death. Toni Basil? Men Without Hats? A-Ha? Modern English? Thomas Dolby? Dexy's Midnight Runners? Again??? Where's Nena and "99 Luftballoons"?   I could name six more interesting choices in my sleep: Pete Shelley. Freur. Lene Lovich. Heaven 17. Fun Boy Three. Blancmange.   Gary Numan, Haircut 100 and Frank & Moon Zappa lend a breath of fresh air, and Rhino does their usual stellar job of remastering, but it's not enough.  This is for the person who: A. is an extremely casual music fan (i.e. buys a CD about every other year), or B. is too young to have been around when these songs were all over the airwaves.  Otherwise, you likely have the better stuff on this CD elsewhere, and who needs to hear "Mickey" ever again? (And I mean EVER again.) If you fit one of the two profiles listed above, you'll be completely content. If you don't--save your money.

 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.  However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort.   But that would mean no sequel books 
 The writer's English is better than my Chinese.  Unfortunately, the editor's English is not very good, and this author has been poorly served (I think)in both line editing (grammar and style) and whatever kind of editing would have made the prose flow and actually convey information. It reads like a term paper by a not terribly bright high school student, who has not tried to synthesize the information found in various articles on the Internet.  Admittedly Tea and Chinese Culture is a big subject, and even discussing Chinese culture is perhaps as bogus as discussing 'European culture.' There have been a lot of cultures over a long period of time.  They are not served by flat sentences like "Sichuan teahouses played an important role in spreading information. The local people went to teahouses not only to drink tea, but also to exchange information.  The most important function of the teahouses was that people could chat with each other there (p 73)." And on. And on.    The layout, binding, and typeface are nice, but too many of the illustrations have feathered edges for my taste. When the author refers to an important painting or teapot (p 59), it would have been nice to see either of them. The illustrations that appear are not always related to the text.  Reading this book irritated me. It's not good enough to have even a veneer of scholarship and not  entertaining enough for a coffeetable.  The sadly OOP book, The Chinese Art of Tea by John Blofeld, is better even at three times the price 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 I bought this book expecting to see a refinement or elaboration of the strategies explained in, "Getting to Yes!". I was extremely disapointed!  The first step, "Go to the balcony" basically says to take a time-out to get some perspective. Come on! Negotiations happen quickly. How often do we have the luxury of "sleeping on it". I need a strategy that can be used on the fly.  There is too much focus on being congenial: "Acknowledge their point/feelings", "Offer an Apology", "Agree Wherever You Can". Sure it's important to understand their interests, but don't compromise yourself just to make them happy. Getting to yes puts it much better, "Soft on then people, hard on the problem".  Skip this book. If looking for a great negotiation book, then buy "Getting to Yes". 
 I'm having the same connectivity issues as the other two reviewers (Noah and Casey). We have two servers where I installed the cards, running Windows 2003 Standard Server with SP1 and all updates; the servers are connected to 3COM gigabit switch. The connection starts just fine, but it cuts off in about 2 to 4 min of medium file traffic, and the servers become inaccessible - not even responding to pings. The card needs to be reset to restore the connection - only to drop it again in the next 3 minutes. We tested the switch to ensure it's working, and we tested the cabling, as well, - everything seemed working fine. Finally, we gave up and installed more expensive Intel 82541PI Gigabit cards. No problems since then.      
 I have the first two sets of cds for Ask and It is given and these new cds for The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent are just the same stuff.   If  you have Ask and It Is Given save yourself the money.   
 Last year for Calc AB, I relied mostly on my notes nd managed to get a 4. This year my teacher was horrible nd I actually tried to use this book to review BC material nd I could not understand it. I think I got a 3 or 4. The questions are way too difficult. Also, you can tell this book wont help you when you look to the explanation to understand a question and it gives a one sentence answer which means nothing. I used barrons for my SAT I math and got a 790. Most of its books are good, but this one surely isnt. You're better off with the Arco, CliffsAP, or even Princeton review. anything but Barrons 
 This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 I love Il Divo but very disappointed with this CD. It's very short and a repeat of songs in previous releases 
 You get what you pay for. These are extremely poorly made. They were slapped together with mis-shaped finger holes and seams. Cheap and fall apart at the slights movement 
 I'm a new dad and received this title as a gift from a friend--thinking I might see "myself" in the book. My wife and I live and work in the Bay Area (the setting for the book), both hold down jobs (cost of living is outrageous here) and often feel utterly overwhelmed by trying integrate a new child into our lives and still make ends meet. I would give anything to have nothing more to do for an entire year than schleep my child down to Royal Grounds in the BabyBjorn every morning to people-watch and then go home to watch SportsCenter and eat PBJs. After a few chapters I wondered: "When does this guy go to work? And who's paying for those dinners at Chez Panisse?" This is not my reality at all nor of any parent I know. And that peeing in a cup business is just gross. 
 I guess I'm not as disappointed with the book as I am w/ Amazon.  I've had the book ordered for 16 weeks and it still hasn't been shipped.  Great book really bad delivery.  Be wary of amazon's ship dates 
 Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's.  After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo 
   Just because some folks don't resemble human two-leggers and only have a hickory nut for a head doesn't mean they aren't real people all the same! Miss Hickory, a doll-like plaything belonging to Ann of the Old Place, maintains her dignity and self-respect during a long New Hampshire Winter. Shocked by the news that the Brown family has moved to Boston until late Spring, Miss Hickory relies on her woodland companions and her own ingenuity to survive without her corncob house.     The relations between Miss Hickory and Crow, Squirrel, Groundhog, a cat named Mr. T., Hen Pheasant and Robin provide light reading for children of a simpler era with its gentle pleasures and few dangers.  Underlying themes include the value of friendship and relaizing when not to be hardheaded.  Prim and resourceful Miss Hickory learns to recognize her own shortcomings and to trust to trust her friends, as she seeks to make a new life in the apple orchard.  This charming story offers literary safety in our modern age with its myriad threats to childhood innocence.  
 This book is vague at best. There is not alot of specific info on making candles or running a business.  This is an OK book if you find it used and cheap, but your money is better spent on a different book if you want specific technical info on how to make candles. 
 I want to take a moment to address the battle system and the license system.  These systems, while well-conceived, have completely ruined the game for me.  For example, the license system is, itself, a very good idea:  It allows the player to craft the character to his liking and tastes.  The problem lies in the execution.   Say, for example you want to learn "Steal." Not only do you have to get the license for it but you also have to purchase it in the game.  This presents problems. In my game, for example, my characters possess a suite of licenses that they cannot use because the shops don't carry that particular item.  The system gives you flexibility but snatches it away by requiring that you not only get the license but to also find the item.   I can't help but to feel hobbled by the license system.  Because these items (which require licenses) come at discrete parts of the game, the developers have cunningly shot up the difficulty.  It doesn't matter that I earned the license for "Shield of Fire" at level 4, I can only get it at level 20+ when its offered in a shop!  The game is very challenging precisely because the mechanics prevent characters from getting better-than-normal equipment after they earned the license. The sly, artificial way the developers of FFXII ramped up the difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary and unnecessary. The cap of three playable characters (at one time) is the straw that breaks the camel's back.   Lastly, the battle system, in my opinion, isn't fitting for a console RPG.  It feels like I am playing World of Warcraft or City of Heroes. The enemies are always faster than you.  It's nigh impossible to chase them down and they always are able to catch up with you. Fighting with a bow is an exercise in futility: the enemies will catch you because the game freezes you in place during firing.   The R2 button, which allows you to flee, borders between being useless to outright deadly to use. While fleeing, the game prevents you from interacting with objects. So if you flee toward a door, you have to stop, pause, let them hit you, before you can escape.    My mouth gaped open when I saw the reviews for the game online.  This game received astronomical scores, some heralding it as the best Final Fantasy ever.  That shocks me beyond belief.   FFXII would be a better MMORPG and an even sharper two-player RPG.  As a single-player game, with shoddy A.I mechanics, the game plays like a tumbling rock.   Perhaps I am just too old school, but this game tastes too much like lollipops and bubblegum.  Your mileage may vary.  
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 This collection of 100 or so newspaper columns is probably the worst material I have read of Thompson's. First of all, it starts OK, but then turns into a liberal rant for the last half of the book. In almost all cases, Thompson's wild and repeated predictions about the fall of Republicans never come to pass. In fact, not one of them came true.  It is a shame that a man with such insidious ability to write from the gut would allow himself to slide into the dark, slimy Left side of politics, all the while failing to report-much less admit-that the Left was as much if not more corrupt than the Right.  I would pass this tome of incoherent bloviating. His other works are far superior to this wasted cache of paper 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 In terms of being of value to the reader, I think the Iraq Report fails for multiple reasons.  To start with, there is the panel's decision to only look forward.  I felt the main value of the 9/11 report was the fact that it documented events leading to the attack on 9/11, and provided me with quite a bit of context which I would otherwise be unaware of.  I presume the panel's decision to not look backwards was based partly in Baker's desires to fulfill his duty to the public as well as maintain his loyalty to the Bush family.  If this is the case, I think he provided a disservice to both.  With this decision, the report focuses solving the problem going forward.  I think this renders the report irrelevant as: 1.  Few of the recommendations are being actively pursued, which makes their inclusion in the report a moot point. 2.  It may be based in my partial naivety of world politics, but it seems that many of the recommendations are not realistic.  For example, the report stresses the necessity of participation from Iran and Syria in order to secure success - yet my understanding of the situation leads me to expect that Iran has no desire to help.  In fact, the report itself expresses the fact that Iran has some interest in keeping our hands tied in Iraq.  Either way, with the exception of a brief discussion of the current state of affairs, the report does little to inform.  It does do a bit to explain how bleak the current situation is, but that is hardly a revelation.  The recommendations themselves don't appear helpful.  And as time goes on, they are quickly becoming irrelevant.  The only positive that seems to have come from this report is that it has sparked some discussion.  The report itself falls short 
 Ravi Zacharias never adequately addresses the core question of atheism.  How do we know that God exists or does not exist?  Atheism argues that God does not exist.  According to atheists, there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of God, unicorns, or other supernatural entities.  The only remaining argument for the existence of the supernatural is FAITH that unicorns and God exist.    From what I've read about atheism, this philosophical stance does not espouse any particular moral system anymore than the belief in God espouses a specific moral system.  If a person claims that the supernatural (or God) exists, then that person has to choose a moral system such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth (and a particular sect within that religion).  If a person claims that the supernatural does not exist (atheism), then that person must pick or develop a moral system.  Examples of secular (without God) moral systems are as follows: (a) secular humanism; (b) the philosophies of Peter Singer, Bertrand Russell, or John Dewey; (c) the morality of your family or community if these people are secular and (d) so forth.        
 Denise Austin is very nice and fun to watch, and it is in a great beach setting, but her steps are soooo COMPLICATED, you need to be a dancer to do them. I have been doing FIRM workouts for years, and I don't get discombobulated very easy, but I felt like I was tripping over my own feet ("Okay, grapevine, boxstep, mambo, turn and jump!"). I almost landed on my head, and the funny thing is, she even trips over HER feet when she is doing it (Watch carefully...you'll see her stumble). How does she expect us to do it???   She seems really nice, really. But I can't reccommend this video 
 First, let me say that I don't read tech books cover to cover.  I use them as a reference when I need info on a specific subject.  After buying this book, the first subject I needed info on is Terminal Services.  The editors must have been half asleep on this one.  There are 6 lines of text in this book on Terminal Services (page 68).  Under those 6 lines is a Note:    "Appendix A contains an overview of the way a terminal server works in Windows Server 2003."  I immediately flip to Appendix A.  I begin reading..."Appendix A: Internet Information Services 6.  DOH!"  Not a single word about Terminal Services in the Appendix.  I immediately lost my faith in this book, and I haven't looked at it since.  I can't comment on the rest of the book, because as I mentioned I haven't looked at the rest of it.  Some may say it is unfair to judge the book based on one subject area.  In my opinion, this is a major editing blunder.  The fact is, when I need answers I have to trust the source.  And after this, I don't trust this book 
 For many years, I have coordinated a study group for human resource individuals taking the PHR/SPHR certification test. I would not recommend this book.  There are statements and questions in the text that do not go into enough depth to be able to study from this book and pass the certification exam.  One example can be found on page 350, question 8, "Which of the following injuries or illnesses is considered work-related?"  Under OSHA you have "reportable" and "recordable" accidents.  The wording in the question is not complete.  Another example is "disparate impact".  The term is defined with two lines of text within the book, however, no examples or details are given on how to determine if there was disparate impact.  I have heard from other certified individuals in our local area who purchased this book and will not use it as a source of study to pass the PHR/SPHR certification exam 
 I think its not wise to refer to only one source here is one of the testmonies:  "I was born in Israel (Palestine then) to a well-known Jewish religious family. We are living in Israel for many generations; well before the Zionists infiltrated the Middle East. Jews and Moslems always lived in peace in Palestine until the Zionists came from Europe, massacred the Palestinians (Dir Yassin, etc.) and forced them to run away from their lands and get locked into the refugee camps across the borders for almost three generations.   Studying in a Jewish religious school in Tel Aviv, I was taught that the 'bad Arabs' conducted pogroms all over Palestine killing Jews. My family told me the opposite: we lived in Palestine in peace for generations with our Moslem brothers. When the Zionists started their pogroms (Dir Yassin), the Moslem acted in revenge and started their own pogroms, killing Jews. However, our Moslem friends actually saved the lives of our family by hiding us in their own houses at a risk to their own lives. " http://www.rense.com/general54/thank.htm  you can make your search with many of the Anti-Zionism Jewish organization all over the world. 
 Mr. Dietrich, whatever his academic credentials, joins the ranks of many a China scholar that so romantasizes China that careful research and balance are rejected.  This book is so hopelessly simplistic and over-generalized  that its almost useless; documentation is almost non-existent, and his  analysis of the events of modern China are reduced to a 6th grade level  with scant detail and almost no evidence.  The "achievements" of  the communists in China are very romanticized and if one wishes to really  understand the last 50 years of China's history, this book is not the way.   Save your money 
 Other books are much better and have more information that is better formatted and explained.  'The Insider's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales' is an excellent resource that I would recommend.  Also, I liked '3 days to a pharmaceutical sales job interview'.  This book may not get you an interview in 3 days, but it is an excellent book to prepare for an interview.  It does a good job explaining how to sell a pen, as well as the STAR format used to answer situational questions.  
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 The book is easy to read and moderately informative but useless as a textbook for a course in critical thinking. About a third of it is just incomprehensible because of the "folksy" writing style. Ex: Ch 4 opens, "Reasoning is often taken to be the hallmark of the human species. Colloquially, reasoning tells us 'what follows what.'" That's the best definition of reasoning you're going to get in that chapter! Errors of reasoning are rampant throughout the book. The first chapter opens with a barrage of statistics to show that CT is not adequately taught.Ex: You will live into your '70's so what do you need to know to be prosperous (as if all knowledge for the entire future needs to be acquired today.) The book is riddled with wrong definitions and erroneous information. The chapter on hypothesis testing is especially egregious in that regard. There are few references later than 1991 (in the 3d edition). Finally, the chapters do not speak to each other: There are completely unrelated chapters on memory, logic, and probability theory, for example. The book might be useful in a course on rhetoric or communications, but critical thinking it is not. The chapter on analysis of arguments is the one good one, but it doesn't redeem this... paperback 
 It used to be that Rhino took excellent care and pride in all of its releases.  This no longer seems to be the case.  Easily, The Name of This Band is one of a small number of superior rock and roll live albums, and preferable musically to the more famous Stop Making Sense, which works better as a theatrical release than as a listening experience at home on the victrola.  That initial expanded touring band featuring Bernie Worrell of P-Funk fame adding his signature swimming textures and a post-Bowie pre-King Crimson Adrian Belew on scorching guitar was both a revelation for many in the audience uninitiated into either seventies funk or seventies noisy art-rock and an amazing leap into the unknown for Talking Heads.  The expanded version indeed adds some worthy items to the overall set list, such as "The Big Country" on disc one and "Warning Sign" as well as a seemingly Fela-influenced and irresistibly funky "Born Under Punches" on disc two.  However, as other reviewers have noted, there was a slow intro to "Crosseyed and Painless" from the original vinyl release that has been deleted, which not only MADE that particular version of the song, as a contrast to the tempo increase which followed, but was one of the most enjoyable sections of the entire 1980-1981 record.  The beginning of this intro can be heard on the fade at the end of "The Great Curve" where Byrne announces that it's okay to dance if you want to.  Maddeningly, the producers at Rhino chose to remove this section from album, thereby breaking what is essentially rule number one of reissues.  While it's okay to remove crowd noises or orchestrations added after the fact, NEVER, but NEVER, delete ANY MUSIC that was on the original release.  EVER.  FOR ANY REASON.  Those very familiar with an original release will want everything that was on it initially, even the parts they didn't like.  Not only that, but apparently this was done to place "The Great Curve" at the end of disc two, the slow intro excised for the mind-numbingly LAME reason to be able to present the exact set list from the tour.  While understandable from a historical standpoint, I doubt that ANYONE would remember the EXACT RUNNING ORDER of the set list (unless they were some kind of fanatic and actually wrote it down during or immediately after the show) from a concert they saw 23 TO 24 YEARS AGO.  Further, if time was an issue for mastering the second disc, Rhino could have easily dispensed with the version of "Once In A Lifetime" in an arrangement that would be finally and fully fleshed out on the next tour, or better yet "Stay Hungry" since it adds little to the version ALREADY PRESENT ON THE OTHER DISC.  Perhaps lopping off a one minute or so intro to a song doesn't warrant dissatisfaction with the entire job, as there is much that is commendable about this reissue.  However, most songs stayed in the can on an original issue for good reason, and only a few on this expanded version needed to see the light of day; an intelligent band's initial instincts are usually correct.  As far as the producers at Rhino are concerned, cutting out that little intro was simply inexcusable.  The band was right in 1982 when they ended side four with "Take Me to the River;" stupid to both remove a piece of the original document and second-guess them at the same time.  Shame on you, Rhino, you've done so many things right in the past.  I think you should either offer to exchange a corrected version to anyone who wants one free of charge, or give those so inclined their money back.  Don't ever make such an egregious mistake again: you should know better 
 I've researched this duo as well, extensively, from a scientific viewpoint, as one who works in a scientific field. The relationship between these two investigators is unique and well worth studying independently, away from the 'whodunnit' scenarios that this book creates.   The duo of Brahe/Kepler is an 'odd-couple'. For a few examples, of which there are countless dozens: Brahe was a showboat, he loved to party, cleanliness was his forte, kept up on his scientific discipline, whereas Kepler hated to bathe, seemed overly introverted, and was prone to reach out to spiritual/astrological notions about atronomical events.   The person most likely to kill Brahe was his devoted wife, whom he virtually ignored. She was the one who administered his medicine on his deathbed. Tycho suffered for days, the pain never went away. And so it was his wife who euthanised him.  The author Joshua Gilder ignored the family's role in Tycho's death, as Tycho ignored his family during his life. With many children, all to maintain the observatory, we hear of not one child who was interested in the data he collected, or even suspicious of malfeasance. It's too bad, because in ignoring the role of Tycho Brahe's family, Gilder poorly scandalised a great scientific contributor, Johannes Kepler.   If you are interested in this topic, please conduct your own research, it will be worth it. Because the book is awful 
 I thouht I'd like this book, what with all the good reviews and my love of English mysteries. But I found it stilted and boring. The concept was good: an investigation sixty-some years after her great-aunt died into whether or not she actually killed her husband, a charge for which she was acquitted. There were letters, interviews, even a diary/journal for clues. But the answer was so obvious and the writing so stilted, I found myself skipping through the pages just to confirm that that my first instincts as to who-dunnit were accurate. (They were.) There's no doubt the author, the wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, is a talented, intelligent woman. But the story was too drawn out, and the writing was pretentious, at least for me. 
 This book disappointed me with belated material and using older java implementations. The content and examples needs lot of updates and confusing the readers. The book suggested website www.webservicesarchitecture.com is not working at all. I find no response from the publisher and author as well 
 I cannot understand why the fuss over this book. The text is disappointing: repetitive, opinionated, insubstantial, more like desultory notes than anything else. The images are all black-and-white and poorly reproduced, and again repetitive and disconnected.  There is too much horror in it. Bataille associates violence, horror, terror, pain, cruelty, with eroticism, madness, ecstasy, the sacred. Perhaps intense cultivation of pleasure creates a corresponding accumulative cultivation of pain. Why should this be so? I don't know except that we have what it takes to explore and we can explore in all and any direction. It's as simple as that.  It's possible to write books and essays that are lucid and meaningful and it's possible to write "The Tears of Eros" 
 This book is horrible!  It is  uninsightful and utterly pointless.  The first 200 pages build an advertisement riddled case for healthy diet and exercise that leaves you less than conviced that John Gray has any idea what he is writing about.  Maybe there is a reason the U.S. has outlawed some of the treatments that are espoused with giving Mr. Gray his "insight" into what our bodies need?  The scientific data was never openly stated, but shrouded in mysterious, sensational statements such as "the same diet plan may cause a woman to gain weight and a man to lose weight."  This book left me wondering if John Gray actually believes this stuff or whether he is just trying to fulfill a book contract with his publisher.  I hope that this review does not dissuade you from ever purchasing a book by John Gray.  If you have never read "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" then I highly recommend that you purchase it and refer to it often.  It is a truly amazing and well written insight into the minds of men and women.  Check it out and leave this diet book on the shelf for someone else

 Anything Goes is a fabulous musical from the stage of the 1930s containing show girls, gangsters, and romance. However, this film version has very little of the above and therefore has only mild entertainment value.   Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor play stage stars, both enjoyable in their own right. They need a female lead for the show, so they split up in search of one. Crosby digs up Mitzi Gaynor and O'Connor finds Zizi Jeanmaire, neither of them expecting the other to find a girl. Herein lies the problem. Both girls believe they will be starring in the show. Steps are taken to let one of the girls down easily, but both men fall in love with the other man's choice of a star.   With songs from the original musical peppered throughout, the songs lose their meaning in a different context. The choreography is uninspiring and that singing is not all that great despite the major names featured. This one is a real bomb 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
 The Lord of The Rings is NOT a text-book! It is a book that should be read with love, joy and wonderment, not EXPLAINED with notes and NOT set as a text so generations of children will associate it with drudgery, compulsion and class-rooms. This is an act of cultural vandalism and barbarism by idiot teachers and rip-off merchants who have no feeling for literature, joy or the sponanious enjoyment of a great tale 
 If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, "uncut" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel 
 I purchased this item because of the song "Believe."  It turns out that it is the only memorable song on the CD, and the only one worth listening to.  I should have waited until there was a downloadable MP3 version of it 
 The book has nice full colour pictures of games, and touches the surface of moddeling in 3ds max, but does't work out real examples of modeling. examples of cubes and primitives are all that are supplied, no professional quality buildings or scenes as the cover suggests. not  money well spend. Recomended book from Quake Arena modeler Paul Steed is Modeling a character  in 3ds ma 
 What? They aren't the best rock band in the world. The only rock songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point? They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great band but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck 
 i finally bought this after hearing so many good things about this album. but now that i have it, i dont think its really as good as everyone says.  the songs arent funny, the music is boring. the only good song is midlife crisis, and that is still medeocre at best. i dont understand why people like this album. to tell you the truth, i think mike patton sounds terrible on this album. he sounds much better in mr. bungle, and that band is just so much better anyway. the only good thing patton has done is mr. bungle. anything else by mike is not really worth listening too. i dont consider him a musical genius like many others do. there is so much more out there that is so much better than this. i find this album a waste of money. it got two stars for midlife crisis.   I have now said my two cents, thank you 
 What a waste of time.  There is no spirit of realization behind the words.  It just made me want to go direct and read the words of Parmahansa Yogananda directly and not waste time on this ego trip 
 Bought this because the game manual was useless. There is so much NOT covered in either the manual or this guide that you are going to have to work the fan sites to find out how to work the finer points of the game.  Leave this guide on the shelf 
 I purchased this book to help me with ideas for homeschooling my children. This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except "turn off the television" and "read to your children". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant 
 FOLKS, BE FOREWARNED. THIS MOVIE IS TRIPE. IT IS SO BAD THAT I DON'T THINK I CARE TO SEE THE REST OF IT - I HAD TO STOP HALF-WAY. I CAN'T GET INTERESTED IN A MOVIE THAT HAD SO LITTLE THOUGHT INTO MAKING IT. A CHILD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IMAGINE THE YAKUZA, ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL CRIME SINDICATES IN THE WORLD, WORRIED ABOUT ONE AMERICAN WHO GREW UP IN JAPAN.  ANOTHER THING WAS THE JAPANES/ENGLISH MISH MASH DONE IN THIS MOVIE. ONE MOMENT SEGAL SPEAKS JAPANESE WITH JAPANESE PEOPLE AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE IS SPEAKING ENGLISH WITH A JAPANESE WHO IS NOT VERY PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH. WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE? ALL ENGLISH OR ALL JAPANESE? MAKE UP YOUR MIND! SEGAL ACTS AS BAD AS IN ALL HIS MOVIES BUT HE HASN'T GOTTEN THE MESSAGE YET THAT PEOPLE MOSTLY WATCHES HIS MOVIES FOR THE ACTION - TO WATCH HIM FIGHT! IN THIS MOVIES HE FIGHTS VERY LITTLE. IN THE HALF MOVIE THAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR HE FIGHTS ONLY ONCE WITH A STREET PUN IN A SCENE THAT MAKE AS MUCH SENSE AS WET BREAD. ALL IN ALL THIS IS BAD AND STUPIT AND BORING 
 Interestingly, I look at this issue in quite a different way. GM food is tested and has been shown to be safe. I try my best to search out GM products and avoid untested organic stuff 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 This book does have a lot of info for its size.  In my opinion it just has your typical memory items that you should already know from your pilot training.  Items such as alcohol consumption and required VFR equipment should not have to be looked up by a current pilot.  Overall the book has a ton of info in it but not really anything you should need while flying and if you were studying at home there are much better books for studying 
 I thought this book was incredibly slow. It never once peaked, nor did I find it all that engaging. Normally there is usually some big finale, or event that grabs you - not here.  The premise of the novel was pretty lame, and the "bad guys" were not exactly hard to figure out right away. All in all very disappointing 
 GWTW certainly was one-sided in its portrayal of the Old South, and I can see how that could be a deal killer for a lot of readers.  Although I consider GWTW to be one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written, I was VERY excited by the idea of TWDG.  The idea of building a "back story" around the black characters in Mitchell's novel is BRILLIANT!  So much could be done with this idea to address issues of race and slavery, as well as to broadside a popular piece of American literature through counterpoint.  Unfortunately, this great idea is wasted because Randall is utterly lacking in talent.  The thing that immediately bothered me about TWDG is the extraordinarily poor use of dialect.  One sentence has the main character narrating in perfect grammar with strong vocabulary and then in the next sentence she's all "he do dat" and "me go sleep."  Randall should have picked one voice for her main character and stuck with it.  This alone represents terrible hack writing, but I must go on and say something about the (snicker) "plot."  The plot, which should be subversive and controversial, fails to rise above the trashy romance novel level, and the (I think they're supposed to be shocking) sex scenes wouldn't shock anyone except my Amish Aunt Minnie.  I actually laughed out loud several times as I read them because I pictured Clark Gable/Rhett Butler saying some of this ridiculous dialogue.    The plot here is so flaccid that Randall inadvertently undermines her own book.  The white characters remain more interesting than any of the black characters.  This despite the fact Randall gives them tons of dirty linen to air in an obvious (and pathetic) attempt to make them interesting.  Her black characters are non-entities, which I believe was her beef with Mitchell in the first place....right?!   As a result, by writing TWDG, Randall is only spray painting a nasty word on the castle walls of GWTW when what she needed to do was bulldoze the original, dance gleefully on its grave, and create something very powerful in its place.  But that would take a skilled writer, and Randall just doesn't have the goods.  "Taking on" GWTW is a great idea, especially to stir up discussion around issues of racism and slavery in our country and our history.  However, to do an idea like that justice requires a talented author (i.e., not Alice Randall).  Maybe Toni Morrison should take this on?  I'd read that 
 I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work 
 I know Wendy has a huge following on her blog, but I have tried and tried to read her blog and her book, and it just doesn't inspire me to read on, or to follow her blog.  There are so many knitters out there who have engaging writing styles, and authors of knitting books who do as well (Stephanie Pearl-McPhee comes to mind), that I simply can't see spending my knitting and spinning time on one that isn't as engaging and entertaining.  This is one of two books about knitting or spinning I regret having ever bought 
 I would buy this book but for the knowledge that my money will go to help further the income of bigots 
 The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk. 
 I had great expectations for this movie, as it included one of the greatest actors of all time, Walter Matthau, as well as, what I thought would be, great subject matter. So sad that the serious subject of in-fighting among the Supreme Court Justices was reduced to a sitcom-like depth.  Neither character seemed to truly represent a mindset (liberal or conservative), but rather, they seemed to argue for no apparent reason. Perhaps some scenes setting up their conflict were deleted?  Regardless, while Matthau is enjoyable to watch, no matter what the script, this was one of his weakest. There are even moments when the viewer has to stop the movie and go..."hey, wait a minute!"...as when the Justices enter the Smithsonian in pouring rain, and come out minutes later to snow, and plowed sidewalks!!!  As for the DVD...it was also extremely weak. It contains no extras (not even a trailer). Some background on the Supreme Court would have been excellent. But then, I guess that would be assuming that this movie was meant to be thought-provoking, which it obviously isn't.  The widescreen transfer is fine. The picture is reasonably sharp, and it isn't hampered by grain. Too bad it was wasted on this movie. 
 This is collection of grainy and VERY BIZZARE black and white photos. I've seen better results from a point and shoot. If your expecting one of those beautiful collections of an artisit's work, SURPRISE! The true value of this work is somewhere between disguarded photos and the ones hid under the bed of an andolescent. Thank you Amazon for your liberal return policy 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 I am interested in losing weight due to Type 2 Diabetes. This book is about emotions and feelings of overweight people. This is probably a good book if you have emotional issues. For me, it is simply BORING, and not at all what I thought it was. If it were not so inexpensive, I would return it 
 I feel I should preface by saying that I love this band to death. However, For Fans Only is pretty shoddy. Every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect. That being said, it's not without merit. I just wish it had been put together better 
 Here are some words from the Big Printer in the Sky:  "The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." -Hans Hoffman  By the time I got to the dynamite the gun powder was wet and soggy 
 When I read the original "5 languages of love" 3 years ago, it changed the way I related to the important people in my life. I also learned how to ask others to show their love in a way I could understand. So, when I saw that Chapman had written a book for singles, I ordered it immediately. I couldn't be more disappointed. While the original book presented sound and common-sense psychological research and insights, the newer "singles" book has devolved into far-right Christian dogma. While the original book was 'descriptive', telling one how to show love in a way one's mate could understand, the new book is 'prescriptive', demanding that one have "wholesome" relationships according to ultra-conservative Christian sensibility. The section on "loving touch" repeats over and over that sexuality is to be expressed only within the bounds of marriage, a view that won't help the majority of possible readers. Even if you're single, skip this disappointing book and find the original in a used bookstore 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 Yuck.  This book was totally boring.  Well, maybe you'll like it if you're, like, 7 or 8 years old or something.   Not only is it totally boring, but poorly written.  Which surprised me because Ann M. Martin is  certainly not a bad writer!  I'm really glad she left the BSC and started  writing a new series about them.  The BSC books are soo boring and  childish.  Please- a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog  runs loose for 2 seconds.  Don't waste your time reading the BSC books.   They are all pretty dumb 
 After owning two Hewlitt Packard printers over the years, I decided to try this Epson printer. Big mistake! This printer eats through ink like crazy. It worked well for the first few months, but since then I have had nothing but problems with printing. Certain colors won't print correctly or at all.   If you like spending money on ink and investing in a poorly built printer, then this is the one for you! Try Cannon or HP instead 
 I do not like this DVD and I am sending it back! It is so BORING, with a stark white background and with Neon droning 1-2-3-4-5-6! I don't think she really shows you HOW to do the moves, she just counts as she does it. Plus her outfit is to loose and baggy over her legs and feet. You can just barely see her toes in her high heels. I do not recommend this, I am a beginner belly dancer and if this was the first DVD I had ordered I would have quit before I started 
 This is a strange book, and I couldn't figure out why until about page 225. Donald starts out even on page one lumping a collection of psychologists into a group, and then stereotyping and belittling them. This went on until about page 50. The problem: many of them actually disagreed with each other about the nature of the mind. It was clear that his attacks were unfair. But why?   Then he grandly claims to have a new, improved theory of consciousness. Here is where the book becomes strangely split. One the one hand, he proposes some structures of the mind that may be novel, but which look somewhat like the work of some of the researchers that he had just belittled. He describes structures of the brain and proposes a function he calls episodic awareness. This is the part of the book that I like. But then he insists on welding this new structure to a hypothesis that I find highly speculative (read wrong). He claims that the human brain is a hybird, partly built by biology and partly built by culture. Nothing in his brain / mind science requires that this odd connection be made. Because of this claim, he takes a number of odd positions, such as that novelists are better psychologists that psychologists are, and that language is a cultural skill rather than an instinct. He makes the whopper of a claim that the associative learning of neural nets is responsible for consciousness.    Finally, past page 200, he comes out of the closet. He is actually a connectivist, one of the tradition that was cut to pieces by Steven Pinker in "How the Mind Works." So the better part of his book is his contribution to mind science, which is not incompatible with evolutionary/modular psychology. However, the book's opening attacks and odd hypothesis of humans as cultural cyborgs comes from his desire to reject the modular theory of the mind for the higher faculties of the human thought. In this book, he tries to allow some of the modular brain organization--and here he may actually be making a contribution to mind science--without relinquishing most of the human mind's unique abilities from the connectivist programme.

 My mother in law has had the 315 canner for many years and it still works well.  We bought the 921 and have had nothing but grief!  The first one we ordered refused to seal so they replaced it on warranty.  The second one seals maybe 1 out of 10 tries!!  The Foundery is offering to replace again with the smaller model(?) so I guess we will try our luck with that one, but the 921?  Never! 
 I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!! 
 As an economics student, this book makes NO sense whatsoever. His ideas are SO far fetched it almost looks as though it is a sci-fi book. Whoever gave it 5 stars must not know how capitalism really works, and how gov't works. It was so off base that I don't even know where to begin. As soon as you read the into and the first chapter you'll notice that the author's propositions are whimsical at best. One thing is caring about our environment (I do), but to create this NGO (Non-Gov't org) to collect environemntal taxation is one of the most nonsensical ideas I've ever heard! Just do yourself a favor and don't buy this book, that is, unless you really want to make the author rich and make yourself miserable 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 I expected to find some product placement (and there was), but had no idea that most of the book would be Dr. Perricone bragging about how much smarter he is than all other scientists and doctors and taking credit for other peoples' work!  There were also a lot of technical mistakes that I found (as a medical student) that make me wonder if he even understands the science that he claims to have discovered.  To top it all off, I received some of his products as a gift and they were terrible.  If you are interested in MD-formulated products, try MD skincare or Murad, both actually work (and, though I haven't read their books, they can't be worse) 
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo 
 I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.  I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally. 
 I bought this book in the expectation that it was going to describe the rational foundations for irrational exuberance.  I was most disappointed to realize that it was just a collection of rather anecdotal comments on a few stories of poor business management (e.g., Enron, Worldcom).    However, not even the commentary is insightful - it only scratches the surface.  I actually think that the title of this book is highly misleading - it is not about how or why market bubbles are created.  Rather, it is a book that very succinctly describes stories of high-profile companies that have coincidentally had their day during times of market bubbles.  To speculate that, for example, Enron and/or its well-paid executives have been the cause of the 2000-2001 NASDAQ crash is to ignore fundamental human psychology and behavior.  Overall, there is no real need to buy or even read this book.  It's unlikely to enlighten any reader wanting to understand the background to the stock market collapse of the 2000s 
 I read this book a while back and decided that I finally had the time to write about it now. This was one of the slowest moving books i have ever read. T he plot was decent but te author spent a good 10 pages elaborating on every detail of Bobby's life and his rise to fame. After a while it just became unbearable and I had to stop. If you have a hig patience novel and like reading roundabout novels then this one is made jst for you 
 'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.  Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.  Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first 
 I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!  The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up.  I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration!  I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine.  In only broke my spirits!  Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!  One of the worst workouts I have ever seen 
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 This book never came together for me.  Right up to the end I was waiting and waiting for everything to come into focus, but it never did.  I never really saw the point the author was trying to make and thus it was a lot of semi-interesting stuff that happened.  The story is about Jack and Connor Reed, whose parents are both dead.  When the story begins, Connor is 17 and being raised by Jack, a junior member of his father's old law firm in Cleveland.  The book then covers the next 23 years of their lives as they marry and divorce and have kids and so forth.  Connor gets Hodgkin's disease but survives while Jack moves to Chicago to reconcile and marry (then divorce, then possibly remarry) his long-time fiancee Mona.  Jack reluctantly has one son with Mona while Connor knocks up his girlfriend Laine and marries her and then divorces her, then possibly will remarry her.  A lot of the story--not just when Connor gets Hodgkin's--has the characters getting sick.  Connor has a migraine.  Laine cuts her hand.  Mona gets mugged and hurts her wrist.  Jack and Connor get food-poisoned on a trip from Cleveland to Massachusetts.  Later Jack gets food-poisoned with his new girlfriend Kathy.  Even Connor's dog gets sick!  The first few times this is fine, but after a while it's repetitive.  Then of course we have Jack and Mona who break up and get together more than Ross and Rachel on "Friends."  This gave the story a soapy edge I doubt the author intended, although she's worked for the National Enquirer, so maybe that's exactly what she meant to do.  Do people really keep breaking up and getting together anywhere other than TV?  And of course Connor and Laine have the same problem to a lesser extent.  Maybe the author wanted us to believe in the bond of family or love or whatever, but as a good 50% of the population (or more) can tell you, most people who break up do not get back together--then break up, then get together, ad nauseum.  But I think the most annoying part of the book is that because it covers 23 years in 260 pages, it's always leaping around.  At the start of every chapter is that disorienting moment when as the reader you're trying to determine when this is taking place, how much time has passed, and what's changed between chapters.  So really you're spending a good quarter of the time reading wondering what the heck is going on.  Not good.  Writing-wise, I'm never a big fan of present tense.  There also seemed like a few grammatical errors and spelling errors the editor did not catch.  There was also at least one factual error as well.  The 1988 movie with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman is "Rain Man" not "Rainman"--a simple check on IMDB could have caught that.  Such trivial errors may seem unimportant, but it erodes my confidence in the author.  Not to mention it's just plain sloppy.  Overall I breezed through this book and it wasn't completely awful, but there are a lot of better books out there.  Still, this is probably a good lightweight read for the plane or beach.  That is all 
 wow, how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far. i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well, i,m still waiting........ 
 I was very disappointed with this film. The premise was really intriguing, with Elvis switching places with an Elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at Graceland leaving the real Elvis to scratch out a living as - what else - an Elvis "impersonator." And now, at the end of The King's life, he's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy. Since it's Texas, the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to Stevie Ray Vaughn. And oh, yeah, JFK is also in this nursing home, having inexplicably been transformed into Ozzie Davis.  How can you miss with a setup like this? Well, for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there's no real need to provide any additional comedy. The movie is flat, with very little humor. As other reviewers have noted, it moves at a glacial pace, even allowing for the protagonists being 80-somethings who don't move like they used to.  Sure, the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film, but there's no point in making a comdey that isn't funny.  Nice try, but booooooooooring. Not at all recommended.  
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 Maguire is a fine writer but is way out of his league narrating.  His voice and inflection are downright  disturbing.  At times his reading takes on a monotonic, robotic tone that sounds like Robby the Robot!  I hope there is another edition ot there because I don't think I can make it through listening to him. And I do listen to audio books all the time!   bo 
 We bought this for the baby's room and it almost started an electrical fire.  Thank goodness our electric tripped off, it probably saved our home.  This thing does NOT automatically shut off, it overheats, and threatens your family.  If something had happened to our baby, I don't even know what I'd do.  STAY AWAY from this fire hazard.. 
 My husband bought me this microphone to replace a broken mike for my Audiostream AS 222 karaoke machine.  It works - badly, so I give it one star.  You can't hear anything out of this mike - it's going back to whence it came from.  Buh bye 
 Don't waste your money on this book! It does have a few useful bits of  info but if you think you could build a gun using this book, think again.  The black and white photos were so over exposed that you can't make out any  detail, the drawings were so faint that half of them couldn't be seen and  nearly all of them didn't have any dimensions.I'd suggest Gerard Metrals  book "A Do-it Yourself Submachine Gun" if you have access to  machining equipment.It's packed full of prints.Also try Bill Holmes later  volumes 3, 4, and 5. He did a much better job on those 
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 I have never heard so much awful sound come out of something so small. These were simply the worst speakers ever. They are scratchy and tinny and you have to turn the volume all the way up and that makes them hiss and buzz. I hope they were defective-- thats what I said when I returned them-- because I can't believe any company would sell something that was this terrible. Oh and the silver-- it is just a bit of paint on the front. The speakers are actually white. 
 This is one of the worst game guides I have read in my life...and I've read a few. I got it back in '97 when the game first came out and spoiled everything (even THE big event at the end of the first disc). I later got the guide from Versus Books and it blew this pathetic book out of the water. It spoiled nothing and had twice the amount of useful secrets (including materia combos). Don't waste your time (and money) with this joke. Thankfully, BRADYGames realized its idiocy, fixed it, and got it right for FFVIII's guide (which basically aped FFVII's Versus Books' guide's style). Then they ruined it again with that awful, useless FFIX guide. I guess money grubbers never learn. And guys, you're supposed to be reviewing the GUIDE, not the game.. 
 The advice he gives is totally absurd!  If a guy came to where I was working and greeted me with "Hey Good Lookin!" and handed me a cheap teddy bear, I'd think he was a sexual predator!    Maybe this stuff works in some places, but in the Midwest, you'd really creep people out.  I mean..."hey Good Lookin'"?  Ewww 
 Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 I've loved some of Shakira's previous songs, and when I heard "Hips Don't Lie", and the fabulous "Don't Bother" (I LOVE those lyrics), I just had to get the album. I put it off for a while, but saw it at a semi-reasonable price, and bought it.  My oh my.   It isn't good!!! The only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks. I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one. Shakira has a lovely voice, but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as "Hips Don't Lie" and "Don't Bother".   Don't bother buying this album unless you are a true, die hard fan of Shakira. Don't waste your money 
 I bought this along with the hardback text (which I love) and find it next to useless. It's set up to coincide with the text, so you go to the chapter you've read, and it just has you fill in the blank sentences right out of the text. If you're into rote learning where you write or say something over and over, maybe you'll like it. I was hoping for something that would add to the book and help achieve greater understanding, or at least challenge me. Also, some of the parts are out of line with the chapter, like they must have updated one of the texts and not the other. The chapter review questions in the hardback text are MUCH more helpful, as is the website that goes along 
 I was very pleased with my first under the counter radio/cd playerplayer. After three years the volume lower button wore out so I had to replace it.  I ordered the identical player but it was terrible. I can play store bought CD's but the radio reception is terrible.  I can't get all my usual stations and there is a lot of interference. I would definately recommend NOT to buy this item 
 I enjoy reading classics, give me Thomas Hardy or Charles Dickens anyday, but I did not find the characters in this book engaging at all. I could not stand the snobbish  attitude of Mrs. Clarissa Dalloway and that of Lady Burton.  It seems I am in the minority here when I say that I positively find this book superficial.  
 I didn't enjoy reading this book. I found it to be too dry and very structured. Useful ideas but not m cup of tea 
 I wanted to read the Japanese classic with some commentary, but mostly the Japanese classic. What I got with this book was "The Book of The Five Rings Greatest Hits" or "How to use Old Books to Make a Killing on Wall Street." I'm very disappointed in the book and if you are looking for Asian classics, read the description very carefully 
 I must confess that I had a negative bias towards this book when I started reading. I like good hard rock music, or classical music like Bach, and I find much of the new worship music rather dull and uncreative. Moreover, the lyrics are often theologically lame or misleading.  After a few chapters some sympathy for the author was awoken. Zschech is honest about (some of her) mistakes and problems, and it didn't sound too easy to be Darlene Zscech.  Sympathy and biases aside - well maybe not 100 % objetivity will follow... Theologically, Zschech seems to assume a charismatic, evangelical Christianity, influenced by the Word Faith movement. It's a bit vague, since the theology is often only assumed, not described let alone argued. Christians know what they believe, seems to be the assumption, and what is needed is dedication. The question a Christian should ask him- or herself is how much they are willing to worship God. How much are you prepared to sacrifice? From these preconditions (no outlined theology and focus on our service) one easily falls into some form of legalism.  Zschech mixes our work and God's. Our worship seems to be inevitibly blended with God's love. The lyrics in "Shout to the Lord" is no coincidence: "All of my days I want to praise, the wonders of your mighty love". The relationship between God's acts and our worship is even reversed, when Zschech says that God acts as a response to our worship. (Granted, some Bible verses are given to support this view, this is definitely not the general thrust of the Bible.) When we praise God, God acts. This also turnes praise into prayer, in an odd way. Shouldn't praise be a response to what God *has* done (Rev. 4:4; 5:9-10)? If we want God to do something, shouldn't we simply pray?  In this book we can read about a showbusiness spirit, look-at-me spirit, and creating an atmosphere of faith. This kind of hyper-spirituality is not based on the Bible, and tends to ascribe our human faults and sins to spirits (cf. James 1:14). The focus on atmosphere (here and now) may make us somewhat overlook the objectivity of the Gospel and salvation.  What I really miss in this book, is what i percieve as true worship. When believers together sing about and give praise to God for salvation through Jesus' death and resurrection - without any other motives than that. In order to have such worship, Hillsong first would need a sound theology. And in order to have good corporate worship, the "intimacy" of the music and lyrics would have to change since they also tend to make the songs individualistic.  Instead of this book, I would recommend Vaughan Roberts chapter "The Place of Music and Singing in Church", which can be found in his book "True Worship" or on the internet 
 Thanks to Walker Percy a manuscript about a rotund medievalist with a pronounced aversion to gainful employment was saved from the dustbin.  Unfortunately, Percy's own works, variations on Russian humbuggery doused in southern discomfort, often slip into an existential coma. The Last Gentleman barely has a pulse. After an engaging opening with a baby who emerges from a hurricane, the novel gets downright tiresome. When examining the limits and conundrums of human freedom, Percy lacks the subtlety of the far superior storyteller Robert Penn Warren. In this instance, Percy's women are insufferably tedious, his men only slightly more amusing. Mr. Vaught induces a grin in seersucker, but the protagonist, a nearly transparent figure known as the engineer, has the charm and presence of an expired june bug. He talks nonsense with a jumbled up girl and, in a fugue state, wanders around for days not knowing his name. After a while, the weary reader prays he'll wander across a busy freeway 
 The buttons on the remote, although many, are not useful.  The only button we use (to advance or back up slides in a presentation) was difficult to use, poorly located, unreliable.  NOT a good selectio 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:  81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,  90% are gone in 3 months, and  95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.    First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.  Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?  The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.  And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.   
 We have used Krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them. This coffee maker has two problems. (1) Its spout is badly engineered. It is impossible to pour out the last 3/4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid. (2) It is a thermos; so the machine does not heat up the coffee, but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed. I like hot coffee. After the first cup, I find that I have to heat up the remainder in the microwave. This is inconvenient. I would not buy another of this model 
 In this meandering attempt to create a generalized theory of the meme the author piles his speculations and theories high. In the end the reader is left entirely convinced -- that there's no such thing as a meme outside of the world of metaphor 
 I could not get the songs to download to the MP3 player.  I followed the instructions word for word and it would not work.  The system froze and when I unplugged it from the USB cable it stopped working all together.  I attempted to contact Coby's customer service but you can not get through on their phone lines.  I finally emailed their technical center and received a generic response.  I continued to question them about the problems with connecting and downloading and COBY instructed me to return these to Amazon?!?!?!? 
 This book is such a downer.  Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house.  Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!!  They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!    If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you.  It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one.   
 I think there are more helpful books out there.  I think Lucinda Basset gains her "expertise" from claiming to have had panic and anxiety problems in the past.  While I don't discount the power of receiving help from someone who has been there, I question the seriousness of her anxiety and question her "expertise".  I see it more of a money making kind of agenda.  The book was repetative and obvious and while the tips are mildly helpful and true, not sure it would be what someone with full blown panic and anxiety disorders would need.  Maybe helpful for someone with mild anxiety or difficulty adjusting to a life change. 
 The pages sometimes get stuck on the posts when u turn them, you have to put straws on the posts for it to work, and it doesnt fold up like it says.  The only good thing about it is that it does hold a book open, which is good for people who can't do that themselves 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 The stories in this book leave the reader with no doubt that they are reading Hemingway, but the collection is rather unremarkable.  Typical Hemingway strengths, including strong and descriptive writing of places and  things, are present.  But I found the stories themselves to be weak 
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
  I bought this book expecting something fresh and entertaining; instead, it read like a very roughly edited diary of an unimaginative naive American: "We met at XX Station at XX am. We ate XX and went to XX Shrine. We went to bed at XX pm." If this kind of rubbish can be published, then I'll offer my diaries from my last ten years in Japan to anyone who wants to make a book of them! I sure hope the author's writing skills have progressed somewhat since she wrote this. And someone should've checked the references to Japanese words before publishing this book - there are too many mistakes to count. Karin Muller's Japanland was a much better read. And if you want to know how to survive in Japan if you're "young and female", buy the Being A Broad survival book for foreign women in Japan instead 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I had read elsewhere that the only thing to recommend this book was the fact that it was light. I have to agree. I would have been upset carrying any more weight especially as the info was often wrong. If one is able to read any other language there are much better books in almost every other language.I would suggest that the hiking section on Spain in the "Lonely Planet" is all one actually needs. As an aside, the comments on the local birds would not pass any children's needs. Example- they comment that we are now obviously nearing the coast as we now start seeing seagulls.The graphs for distance and elevation are not nearly as accurate or as detailed as those available for free at many of the hostels. The info is often so poor that I have serious doubt that the authors walked yhe Camino before writing the book. they definately did not spend many nights staying in any of the refugios 
 I'm not going to waste much time on this book review except to say that of all the books I've read on this disorder this one is the worst.  This guy comes across as a total jerk and I think this book is a fake. I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.  If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan 
 I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys crafts and modeling, or just to everybody who is curios about the making of things, because this book contains ready-to-use printable and editable (look for the cd-rom) patterns for the most used types of packaging on the market.  Be aware that this book is just a collection, a dummy, with no explanations.  But unfortunately, all the examples I have printed directly from the source files were somehow misfit and ended to be weird useless objects (stuff for 'The Design of Everyday Things' by Donald A. Norman, if you like).  I am not sure if this problem is in my copy of the book (an 'errata corrige'?), I hope that you'll be more lucky than me.    To all design students I would recommend this book, instead: 'The Packaging Designer's Book of Patterns' by Lazlo Roth, George L. Wybeng 
 I started reading this to my 6 and 8 year old, and got about 5 chapters into it before I started to doubt my choice of reading material for these kids. For one thing, the language is archaic and hard to wrap your mouth around. But for another, the values expressed in this 300 year old book are a bit disturbing. The God-fearing family runs aground on an idyllic island full of naturally growing fruits and vegetables, and arrives with supplies aplenty to draw from, but within a week they have slaughtered at least a dozen creatures. Seems to me the main theme of the book is "man's dominance over nature." Doesn't work for me 
  Well Mr Whiting , I sure as hell can guess you did'nt like ''Georgie'' there was scarcely a page went by when when you didn't refer to GSP jnr's  sqeaky voice. I could'nt help but think through the book you were attacking his personality . Not one for Patton lovers 
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 This is one of her finer albums, but with this artist that is not saying a great deal.  She has better song selection on this album than on previous ones, but her voice is still no comparison to the other ladies of country music 
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 I had never read a novel by Tom Wolfe, and I certainly won't read another one.  Tom Wolfe is so out of touch with Southern culture, youth culture, and the 21st century that I actually felt embarassed for him.  With impressive diligence, Wolfe painstakingly mapped out the Southern dialogue for the reader with complete disregard for Georgia's actual dialect.  Hey Tom, not every Southerner sounds like a 19th century Savannah plantation owner.  Secondly, at times, I actually became physically uncomfortable with Wolfe's attempt to manufacture rap songs and names of rap artists.  In fact, his book seemed to be a never-ending stream of stereotypes elaborated with self-indulgent purple prose. Third, where was the middle-class?  Virtually every character was either "living on the hill" or "by the railroad tracks".  Wolfe focused on only the most superficial aspects of Atlanta culture--including his tedious and pointless descriptions of downtown Atlanta.  Finally, when I crawled my way across 800 pages, it seemed that Wolfe just gave up on any kind of ending; a former tycoon became a Stoic Evangelist (give me a break!), a convict turned himself over to the police...The End.  
 I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.  The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
      Bill O'Reilly has a good reason for his massive paranoia:  Somewhere, deep in the recesses of his brain, he knows something's wrong.  Only he's got it backwards:  The "secular progressives" are doing just fine, but he's the one with the serious problem.  Here's a guy who had to pay millions of bucks to settle a sexual harassment suit; yet, he's proclaiming himself the arbiter of the correct, "traditional" point of view.  Only in an era of the stupid, undereducated and witless would Bill O'Reilly have a modest role to play.  Save your money 
 The back says  He wants her for one night only.  Spanish billionaire Raul Carreras is used to getting what he wants: Nell rose will be his for only one night, and for his pleasure!  Then she becomes pregnant with his child.  Raul's red-hot seduction is hard to resist.  But when Nell falls pregnant with her Spanish lover's child, will she tell him?  The story begins with Raul's neice and nephew running away and he thinks they have been kidnapped.  They run to Nell their former nanny, and Raul thinks that Nell is his brothers former mistress.  So anyway he treats her like crap but asks her to come and be the childrens nanny again and help them adjust to a new life w/o their father who died recently.  I won't give away the whole story but in my opinion the book was very boring and I am suprised I was able to read the whole thing.  There was nothing even very dramatic about her pregancy.  The way he found out was kind of cheesy if you ask me 
     I suscribed to this magazine since I got a great offer on it from the company I get my other suscriptions from so I decided, why not??    Its been a year and, although the previews of each week's prime-time programs are fun (2 pages worth) I was very dissapointed. The articles are empty, boring and some downright retarded; rehashing show's dialogues, requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around.    I realize this is an entertainment magazine, but still, the articles in People magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp!!!    Do yourself a favor and just buy a TV guide - MUCH more interestin 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists. 
 I am 88. All my life I have loved my English History & the English Countryside. I have travelled in all the old 52 Counties of England & Wales. Against this background I find that Alison Weir has written the best historical Biography & the best History I have ever read. Of the criticised detail; for me,the Topography is a bonus. Overall the detail provides the facts. Most Professional Historians patronise the lay reader by relegating the facts to references or footnotes. Then by a deliberatively cultivated oersonal style they present their interpretaions of the facts as the correct history. Alison Weir allows the reader to make his own interpretation of the facts as well as a judgment on her own interpretation of them. I have not yet even read all the book - as you know its delivery was delayed - but I have read enough to know that each remaining page will continue to give me increasing delight. I end with one of many personal experiences reading this superb book.        "In August 1924 I had a family seaside holiday at Walton on the Naze. One evening there was an adventurous expedition with other families to walk 'Round the Point'. As a child of 6 I remember clearly seeing in the evening sunlight the grassy mound with a few rocks where the castle once stood. No mention was ever made then or later to this being the place where Isabella had spent her first night in England on her return. In fact our families' expedition was a memorable occasion as there were several children for the adults to safeguard & we were nearly cut off by the incoming tide. Now my memory of that shingled shore is enhanced,not by nostalgia,but knowledge. 
 Only five animals spotlighted. No explanation of orientation i.e. dorsal.  No explanation of what is depicted, especially maddening with certain cross sections. The art is uniform, clean, and attractive.  The attention to each animal is not identical, i.e. ones mouth is highlighted in depth while others are not 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.  For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.  On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves 
 I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY 
 First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.  The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.  It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.  If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)  If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.  If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'  But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 My entire kitchen is Kitchenaid. I bought this can opener three years ago. It was awful...difficult to use, shredded the paper at the top of the can's label, and was very difficult to get started. Because I love Kitchenaid products so much, I assumed that this was just a defective can opener, threw it away, and bought another. The second one was even worse! It worked okay the first couple of times, but now it barely cuts at all. It grinds the top of the can, making dents, but won't actually make a cut. Once I can get it started, I cannot finish it because it "messes up" the can pretty badly. This one is going in the garbage as well. : 
 I was so angry that I wasted time reading this spectacularly boring book that I had to warn others.  The storyline is repetitious as is the diction...I have to agree with the author of review that asked if DS even has an editor anymore.  Sheesh... 
 Not for small kids, the paint is messy.  The goop has good consistency, it would serve for a science project or so, but not as a toy 
 A team must write this book because there is no there there.  Clarity is lacking. The author's voice is missing. I wasn't challenged and couldn't get excited about the areas described within. 
 I enjoy both Petra Haden's voice and Bill Frisell. In this case, the combination of several weak songs and few suprises on the stronger material combined to make this a disappointment. I could see what they could be getting at, but I was underwhelmed. 
 Great fan of Cassandra Wilson, especially her wonderful sense of instrumental colour in her arrangements. This, however, (maybe - probably - intentionally) is entirely different. The recording is just SO BAD that I can't really even listen to anything straight through. Hugely dissappointing if played on anything but a car radio (at speed) 
 5 Secrets to a successful marriage, and sex, is not one of them.  Among the many idiotic writings you'll find in this hand book for ass-backwards 21st century religious nut jobs.  Read the parts about the lady on the airplane from the church of satan and about the son coming home from college with an earing if you want to laugh at how pathetic and blow hardy the idiot who wrote this garbage is, if their was ever an excuse for book burning, we've found it 
 I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this 
 Other current pop-rappers like Jibbs or Unk that have one or two hits usually have a consistent album behind them.  At least that's what I thought.  I can't say the same for Mims.  With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear.  Pretty soon you find that it's not really either.  Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride.  Savior self, skip Mims 
 I have a working copy of this book that was given to me while taking the product design course at the University of Texas.  The book would probably be a lot better if it had a good index, but since it was thrown together to give the class something to read, it doesn't.  I didn't use the book much for class, but have used it some since then.  This book uses design tools that are good in theory, but sometimes take too long to actually be used in a real situation (i.e. QFD) 
 I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot.  With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it.  Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 The product of broken home, 10-year-old Ryan Tyler (Ryan Slater) takes a plane trip all by himself to China, where he hops on a tour bus and finds himself in the lush bamboo forests on an amazing adventure to rescue a baby panda taken by poachers. A mix of real and animatronic critters were used to portray the black and white marsupial. Very young children might enjoy it - others, seek your adventures elsewhere.

 Be aware that you may share this same experience if you download the book.  After the book was downloaded to my computer, I was prevented from printing past the first 60 pages due to properties designed into the file.  The book is over 300 pages.    In order for me to receive a printed copy of the entire book, it will be necessary for me to have the hard copy sent to me.  Since I do wish to have the hard copy, I will reorder and pay the shipping and the cost of another copy of the book 
 interesting, well documented, with marvelous illustrations.Definitely a good buy for adults who still dream  of fairy tales characters. It is a pity that the collection does not include stories from "One thousand and one nights". Otherwise it will be perfect and complete. 
 "Make it hop, boing like a bunny/Girl can I touch you where it's sunny/or a purse and make you give her some money..."  WOW!  These are the type of rhymes that have been hitting the St. Louis mainstream since mid 2000. As many of the reviewers have stated, Chingy has very little or no talent at all. The 2 lines above were taken from his hit single "Right Thurr". To be honest, I bought the CD just because of the big hitting bass of that song. So when I decided to listen to the rest of the CD, things just went down. Aside from Chingy's terrible rhymes, the production is horrible also. Blame the Trackstarz for some of the short commings as in the second song "He's Herre" with the addition of Chingy's, I'd say sub-medicore, lyrics with the song makes it not all good. Another Trackstarz production is the song "Chingy Jackpot" that may be known to get people in a club onto the dance floor. By the three songs I just named, most of Chingy's [wack] lyrics have something to do with sex, drinking, or smoking. He couldn't even leave it out of the possibly best song on the CD and the 3rd single "One Call Away" a love song where he says, "...we can go puff on a blunt/oh you don't smoke, we can go somewhere and get drunk..." Intoxication is highly on his agenda. Sex is also on it too as he says on the song "Sample That A**" featuring Murphy Lee of the St. Lunitics which is ran through by a weak (and uncreative) hook. To make matters worse, the thought he could take the talent on (I'm not sure if this is really) singing on the song "Wurrs My Cash" thinking he is a pimp asking one of his so-called hoes "Wurrs My Cash?" She would have been better off with a [normal] 9 to 5 job, than working for this joke of a pimp.  But there is a sunshine through the small cracks of this CD. Chingy barely steps his lyrical content on the second single "Holidae Inn" (give it a few more years before that becomes a lawsuit), where he raps about going to a party with Ludacris and Snoop Dogg with a bunch of girls. "Bagg Up" is a song for some reason I'm liking, because Chingy pulls it together with some meidocore lyrics such as "The streets is mine, like a mixtape when an emcee rhyme..". The last song "Right Thurr (Remix)" features Jermaine Dupri and Trina was not that much appealing as the first one, unless you want to hear some verses from others.  Chingy's debut is not all that good except for those who have a taste for his style or want to hear some club or dance tracks to bounce to. Recommended for people who are exactly just for that, or just want to hear some music come out of St. Louis.  Production: C- Lyrics: D+ Guest Appearances: D+ Oveall:D+  Standout Tracks: One Call Away, Bagg U 
 This was recommended to me based on prior purchase - Mofro. It sucked, instrumental only, no lyrics 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This is the fourth edition and perhaps the worst introduction to fluid mechanics book ever printed. I am a PhD student and have had many courses in fluids. This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. The theory is correct but the derivations of certain equations and the solutions to many, many, many problems are wrong! I cannot believe these errors have survived to the 4th edition. Another reason to avoid this book is because the solutions provided with instructors make great leaps in solving problems. Many of the solutions state "this problem requires a laborious derivation and is much too hard to solve" or something to that effect! I also assist in teaching many intro fluids classes and this makes life miserable. Please use the 5th edition (or any other fluids book for that matter. 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.

 I am a artist and bought this book for reference for painting bears. I discovered I could have taken better photos of bears at the zoo than what is in this book 
 As a former park concession employee, I rolled my eyes virtually every time I turned the pages of this book (and yes, I turned them and kept going-- kept hoping things would get more logical).  Concession employees with huge boxes of makeup don't make best friends with NPS backcountry rangers.  Concession employees don't even act like the NPS exists, and vice versa.  Climbers wouldn't put up with Californians driving off-road in their SUVs (can anyone say let-the-air-out-of-their-tires-- or better, piton-in-the-sidewall?)  And as awful as the assistant superintendent is, Yosemite is famous for its gung-ho law enforcement folks who would be all over a quadruple disappearance-- I can't see even a drunkard law dog ignoring Anna's repeated pleas for help.    Lastly, Nevada based the crux of the mystery on a well-known actual incident, just as she did her mystery in Glacier.  Seems a little convenient to me-- where's the creativity in that?    Having said all that, the thing that rang absolutely true was the pecking order of the NPS and the concessioner, in which a waitress would seem slightly less-than-human by "real" park rangers.  Not fair, but that is how it is, and this is why I keep reading Nevada's stuff (and giggling)-- even with its flaws.  
 I read this book because it was my book club's choice. The best thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise and the worst thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise. This one falls under the second. No continuity, no story, just a compilation of research results. It might work as a thesis to fulfill a degree program but not as general reading. Boring 
 My daughter likes it, but only because she has an unusually high level of patience.  Her friends refuse to play it after they tried unsuccesfullly to finish a game.  30 minutes into it and they were nowhere near even the middle of the game and that was with a set of friends who are quiet and calm.  I would never pull this game out for some of her other more rambunctious friends.  Please DO NOT by this game 
 Years ago I watched a young comedian I hadn't viewed before on a TV special from the Montreal Comedy Festival.He was a wow, with a devastatingly and savagely funny piece on the Gulf War which had just ended.Sadly having switched on part way through the piece I never found out who the comic was.I ached to be able to get hold of the piece on video and searched in vain for years looking for it.The comic was Bill Hicks and now,as then, his take on America and its place in the world has never been more relevant.This DVD contains some of that early footage,along with a great deal of his subsequent material.You don't always have to be totally in sympathy with views (his stance as a militant smoker for example) to find him seeringly funny.A man who makes you laugh whilst challenging a great many widely held assumptions.Watch Bill and you realise how trivial a great deal of contemporary comedy has become.We need more comics like him. 
 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 Mr. Das (aka Jeff) seems to enjoy dragging the reader through as much suffering as he can recall. That appears to be his main point. The text is scattered with no logical order.  Frank Hazelwood 
 I used this mouse on my laptop, and it ran very well, no major complaints. I'm a designer, and work closely and very intense in photohop, dreaweaver and other goodies. HOWEVER, it just died. RIP.... ; ( i'm little disappointed. I only had it for 6 months. I'm not sure what the life expectency of a optical mouse? I'm hoping I still have my papers and box. I will attempt to send for a warrenty refund. I probably wont buy another, due to the fact, i'm VERY impaitent, and I need a more reliable mouse 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.    Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
 Even with a brand new set of batteries, this handset still fully discharges in a few hours even when no calls are made.  I have the older Motorola MD61 and it has usually a 3 day life even when making several calls a day.  Don't buy the 76 
 if you want your children to think that the"cure" for any problem, such as daydreaming, lack of energy or hyperactivity comes in a powder or a pill, then "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic" is right up your alley.  if you believe in slipping mood-altering substances into your child's body is a good thing, here's your book.  if you think children's shortcomings should first be treated with love, avoid this book and the rest of the Piggle-Wiggle books, which treat children like mindless [kids] that parents must trick into good behavior 
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 Okay, I don't really know what to say about this book. But I try to teach myself how to do some problems out of the book and sometimes it's plain confusing. In the examples they give you steps but they don't really explain why you do the steps. They basically give you answers and it's not really a good book to learn from. A good teacher who knows how to teach would be good to add on with the book... 
 I canceled the order for this book it was paid by check and I have never received a refund 
  `Pranks ", aka The Dorm that Dripped Blood  is one of the most disappointing Slasher films   from the 80's. Spoiler ahead. Its cheese appeal isn't even that good, I own it because I have a slasher collection ,I watch it about once a year thinking maybe it will grow on me but it doesn't. There are a couple of good kills but has very weak acting and I didn't like the characters ,it just didn't work for me and I even liked "Don't Go In The Woods Alone "its all in what you like I suppose but trust me it pretty much sucks...I'm sure Daphne Zuniga gags when she thinks of this movie. Plus she was one of the first to be killed anyway. 
 Mellow, sappy and annoying. Why would anyone want to buy this? 
   This book was one of the biggest wastes of my time as far as 'self help' books are concerned. I would never recommend it to anyone, especially someone with low self esteem.  "So when we've had it with our friend, colleague, or sibling, it's because he or she is giving voice to parts of us that we have suppressed of rejected, parts of us that don't fit the persona we've created to present to the rest of the world."  Pure rubbish 
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable.  As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless.  Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text.  No doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!  What's more, the translation is poor.  Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 sublime is an all around good band with great soul and inspirations, but this album is more like a sign of what was to come for the boys. sadly, i think they would have been way too alternative mainstream if brad would have lived...alongside bands like red hot chili peppers and 311 for eternity...my advice is to stick with Iron Maiden. very random of a recommendation, but youll be surprsied how some bands just fall apart compared to others...but if you really want some reggae So-Cal punk, get 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood 
 Robert Johnson was one of the most enigmatic bluesmen of the 20th century and his life is still a mystery today.Fans only have two grainy pictures of Johnson and various accounts of the mans' life by those who knew him and those who purport to have known him.Having died at the age of 27 by poisoning only adds to the legacy.Johnson, like many of his contemporaries in that early century era, liked women and whiskey and that became his undoing...a jealous husband poisoned his drink and sent Johnson off into the history books forever.In this documentary, other bluesmen will tell you what Johnson was all about, right up to those final hours but some of their testimony is questionable, as was Johnsons' entire life.But the music is there and it lives up to the Johnson image. Many songs are haunting (Hellhound on My Trail, Come On In My Kitchen) and many are sad (Drunkenhearted Man,From Four Til Late)but they all carry Johnsons'unique stamp on the blues. One listen and you'll hear it.Danny Glover's narration is compassionate and blues musician Keb Mos' silhouetted figure makes you feel that you are watching actual footage of Johnson himself. Good stuff..

 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
 This is an uninteresting paint-by-the-numbers experience of clicking the the mouse to make things happen to canned material, without empowering you to use the software with your own projects. Well written and illustrated, but of little value 
 Having enjoyed McCauley's first novel & read enough reviews that lead me to want to read this as a sort of lighthearted romp along the lines of a gay male 'Sex & the City', I was almost totally put off by this dreary and sour book.  The main problem for me was that almost all of the characters, including at times the narrator/protagonist, William, are so unlikeable and often unpleasant, that I found myself wanting to escape their company.  Even the 'object of his affection,' Edward, is so sulky and petulant throughout the book, that one cannot really root for or even care whether they get together.  The non-rent paying tenant Kumiko; the belligerent self help guru, Marty; the effete Belgian, Didier; the arrogant perfumer, Sean; the bulldozing fellow agent, Deirdre, and on and on  - all of these characters are so meanspirited and nasty that the book is a downer.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that it is also self-consciously a 'post-9/11' novel, but to wallow in such misery is more than I could take for the few chuckles the book elicited... be warned 
 ...unless you've never read any of his other books.  Don't get me wrong, I can't say enough good things about Robert Kiyosaki's books.  If you haven't read them (Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, etc.), I highly recomemd that you do.  But there's nothing new in this book.  It just a retread of ideas already presented in his other books, and not as well.  If fact, reading it felt like a advertisment for his other books and products 
 Don't waste your money like I did!  Where to start?  ...how about all of the Catholic-bashing that goes on, the author is not a religion hater, this we know b/c he actually seems to legitimize the Muslim prophet, while bashing everything that Christianity is based on.  Plausability is lacking in everything from the "CIA-cleric" to the absurd romance between Tess & the FBI guy, who can't bring himself to date anyone because he is the product of a Dad who committed suicide...(I guess I missed the psychological link here!) The author figures he doesn't have to give a plausible story...any old story will do.  People survive unsurvivable situations without the least bit of modern medical assistance.  I would never buy anything from this author again 
 If you are looking for a book that gives meanings behind the names don't buy this book.  It only gives the author's opinion on the name or a list of famous people who share the name.  I also find that is does not have a good selection of names.  For example, it lists the name Torquil(which I have never heard of) but does not have the name Travis, and the book even mentions the name Travis in an opinion on another name.  I find it opinionated and poorly written 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.  they did let me get a refund which was nice.  i would use them again for that reason alone.  
 This man lives in a world od distorted reality.  Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production.  Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me.  He talks about Cuba in this book...  The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better?  Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better.  However, I hate the message that it sends 
 It definitely seems to be more religious than I expected. Although I only browsed though it, I thought there were going to be more recurring themes regarding reincarnation, children relating stories of having been here before,or knowing things beyond their circumstances. It does have some sweet stories and is nicely laid out for the reader. I got a bit choked up reading a couple of the stories 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely.  I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere.  It can make for some rugged reading.     Still, the book is worth the effort.  I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.    And who am I to judge a book?   Because I spent money to buy it 
 I am a keen reader of music biographies, and this without a doubt or even a close contender, absolutely the worst I have ever read. The subject of the book is fascinating, it is the author that is the problem here.  David Bret is surely the most pretentious man to have ever put pen to paper. He doesn't seem to feel that a page is complete unless it has at least one "phrase francaise" in italics on it, where surely the English word would suffice. I speak French, so I can understand him, even though I find it extremely frustrating, but not everyone with an interest in Morrissey is bilingual and this is extremely alienating to the reader. It doesn't stop there though. Despite Bret's assertion that Morrissey doesn't speak a word of French, "not even a `merci' in-between songs at a concert", he gives Chapter 6 a French title- "On ne badine pas avec l'amour". Quite why this is appropriate for an English language biography on Morrissey is beyond me frankly. All I can think of is that David Bret wants the whole world to know that he can speak French. Well done David, give yourself a pat on the back.   Throughout the book he constantly creates comparisons between Morrissey and the French singers (and friends of David Bret), Edith Piaf (who I have at least heard of) and Barbara (who???) which quite frankly do not appear to be there. In my opinion, the low point of the book is when he claims that, "Few songs better sum up Morrissey's life than [.....] `There's a place in hell for me and my friends', later adapted into French by this author for Barbara" and then proceeds to quote his French translation rather than Morrissey's own words!!!! This sort of self-indulgence is absolutely inexcusable. Another exercise in self-indulgence comes at the start of Chapter 5. Each chapter starts with a quote, usually from Morrissey himself or from a music journalist, but in Chapter 5 we are treated to a quote by none other than Mr David Bret!! This is surely journalism at its absolute worst.  It's not even as is there is a decent biography lurking underneath all the pretension. A few dates, excruciatingly dull descriptions of certain concerts in minute details, and a frankly boring analysis of Morrissey's songs is pretty much all there is to this lamentable biography. The whole book tells us far more about the author than it does about Morrissey, it is littered with his own opinions, such as the pointless part where he informs us what his second favourite Morrissey song is, yet strangely without ever mentioning his favourite, he tells about his own godmother and about how the famous Barbara named a character in a play after him, yet it is very thin on actual content. He mentions an interview that Morrissey did with a magazine that was successful due to "the fact that [the journalist] published his comments verbatim [...] without attempting to draw attention to himself, as too often happens with the music press" Surely this must have been written with a trace of irony, as this book is the worst example that I have ever seen of an author being more concerned about drawing attention to himself than his subject.  Then of course there is the issue of sexuality. Looking at reviews of David Bret's other books seems to suggest that he has a certain fascination with homosexuality and bisexuality, so of course he has a field day with Morrissey, going over throwaway comments and hearsay repeatedly, without of course managing to draw any conclusions.   All in all this is a deeply unsatisfying attempt at a biography. In the first half of the book he jumps around from the 80's to the 90's and then back again, until you have no clue where you are, and then in the second half he seems to just rush through it as if desperate to finish. Maybe he was getting as bored of it as I was. His research seems to have extended only to looking under his bed through all his back issues of a certain French rock magazine and picking out quotes from Morrissey, and he has certainly never spoken to the man himself. He actually includes a quote from Morrissey talking about the first edition of this book when it came out, "It's unsettling to read supposedly factual accounts of you and your life from people who have never come within twenty feet of you"  Although after reading this book I feel I know absolutely nothing at all about Morrissey, I am absolutely certain he would LOATHE both the book and its author. David Bret is too obsessed with himself, Barbara, and the fact that he can speak French to actually engage us or tell us anything we want to know. Oh yes, and the `extensive' discography at the back doesn't even contain Vauxhall and I. Utterly pathetic 
 Taking Albert Pike as my cue, Morals and Dogma is far more candid about the origin of the Craft than this book.  First of all, searching for the origin of Freemasonry (or at least its preservation) amongst the Knights Templar is preposterous.  There is no evidence the Knights Templar possessed, preserved or advocated any gnostic gospels or secret teachings of Jesus.  This is an anachronism since the gnostic gospels have only gained notoriety in our time.  The Knights Templar were a bunch of mercenaries who had purely mercenary interest when they safely guarded pilgrimages to the Holy Land.  They were good investers and eventually became creditors.  With this money they purchased land in France.  The French King coveted this wealth and property and so spread the libel about the Templars being heretics in order to use the Pope to get rid of them so that the French King could confiscate the Templar's property.  The Pope at the time even regretted that he tried them for heresy.  The Templar origin only operates as misdirection.  I don't know if this is deliberate, although it is hardly unlikely that it isn't deliberate.  Afterall, masonic texts clearly spell out the Kabbalistic origin of freemasonry.  Even the legend of Hiram Abif and Solomon's temple are ostensibly Juwish and should not be disregarded and eclipsed by this Knights Templar nonsense.  Freemasonry is a gnostic religion.  Specifically, its gnosticism borrows heavily from juwish sources, such as the Kabbala.  The pythagorean theorem, and other nonjuwish notions are merely trappings that have been added on to the Kabbalistic core of this gnostic cult.  With regard to Egyptian mysticism, I find it unlikely that it was transmitted to the Freemasons over the centuries since it was only recently that Egyptian hieroglyphics were deciphered by Champollion (1790-1832).    The only record we have of Jesus' life is the four Gospels (There are of course Roman and Greek and Jewish sources such as Tacitus, Lucan, Josephus and the Talmud; but, I'm referring to "eye witness accounts").  Outside of the record His disciples left us, there is no other sources of what Jesus said or did.  Therefore, to presuppose as Christopher Knight does that he has superior historical materials than the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and the rest of the New Testament, is the epitome of nonsense.    Don't waste time with this book.  It leads you on rabbit trails.  It has countless more errors than this which I need not go into.  
 This book is so poorly written it's actually funny. Cook's verbose, pointless descriptions, his banal, clumsy dialogue, and his generally tactless, maladroit writing makes reading this book a complete waste of time. The story? It doesn't matter because Cook's ineptitude as a writer completely overshadows any merits it may have. If you consider yourself intelligent, you should not even open this book 
 Bart Ehrman's attack on Dan Brown's DaVinci Code raises as many questions as it answers, prompting a diligent student to write an attack on Ehrman's attack on Brown. Needless to say this might engender an infinite series of attacks on attacks, so caution is the best approach. Nonetheless, let's look at some of the errors that Ehrman commits while trying to give us the "truth and fiction" in the DaVinci Code. I'm focused on a single chapter (Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Marriage) to keep this review to a minimum.  Ehrman asserts that "most of Jesus' followers, and certainly his closest followers, were men (p. 145)."  We'd all agree with that, but before we take it for granted, you must consider that the gospels were written by men with an obvious bias against women, typical of the times. So it should be said in fairness that our impression that Jesus' most active followers were men comes from the stories told by men. In the rare case of a gospel by a women (the Gospel of Mary), for example, his closest adviser is a woman, not a man. Hence Ehrman's "history" may not reflect the "truth" but merely the opinion of the men.  Ehrman urges us to "recall the saying of Jesus preserved for us from Q...(p. 146)." Someone call the Press! Apparently Ehrman has discovered the Q document. That warrants a major press conference. I was under the impression that Q was a hypothetical document, but now Ehrman apparently is able to find sayings that have been preserved in it. This type of thinking is sloppy and doesn't belong in a serious book.  Ehrman uses a passage from Matthew (19:28) that says the disciples will be seated on 12 thrones to judge the 12 tribes and he concludes that "The future rulers of God's people would all be men (p. 146)." That would assume that all the disciples were men, which is by no means the clear case. It's rare for any of the gospels to give the names of all 12 disciples, and some gospels give the names of as few as 7. So who knows who the other 12 were. And certainly there are gospels which talk about Mary being a disciple, and she's not a man. So Ehrman's conclusion is faulty.  Ehrman claims "Of course there were not many Epicureans or Cynics in Jesus' immediate environment of Palestine... (p. 150)." Needless to say there is no citation for this assertion. That's because you probably couldn't find one. Cynics were known for their wandering, and it's hard to believe that there were not cynics visiting Sepphoris or Caesarea which were major cities, and Sepphoris was well within Jesus' "immediate environment." By the way, the word Palestine was adopted nearly 100 years after Jesus' death, so it's more than curious to find Ehrman talking about Jesus and Palestine.  Ehrman spends a lot of time questioning whether or not Jesus was married and he continually asks the question - "Why would his wife never be mentioned? (p. 153)" Apparently Ehrman has forgotten that the gospels were written by Christians who belonged to sects that were in competition with the sect that was represented by Jesus' family. It's for this reason that the writers slanted the gospels to paint the family in a negative light, as Jeffrey Butz has so brilliantly pointed out in his book The Brother of Jesus. If these same authors went to so much trouble to denigrate the brothers and sisters of Jesus, to what lengths would they have gone to remove any traces of his wife and children (Some scholars believe that the wedding at Cana is such a trace)? For if he had been married and had children, Christianity would have developed in a dramatically different way. While I am not arguing here that this is the case, any adequate discussion of the  situation surely must raise this possibility. Ehrman, however, for whatever reason, neglects to mention it.  Ehrman claims that "Magdalene indicates her place of origin - the town of Magdala... (p. 154)." Yes, that's one theory. But only one. And not a particularly good theory since it wasn't called Magdala anyway, but Magadan (Matthew 15:39), and it's hard to see how you go from Magadan to Magdalena. A better theory has been put forward by Margaret Starbird who believes that Migdal (the ancient name for the city, which means tower, becauser there was a fish tower there) refers to the fact that Mary "towered over" the other disciples. In other words, a nickname for "Mary the Great". Whether you subscribe to Starbird's theory or not, it deserves to be mentioned. But, in fact, it is in keeping with Jesus' tendency to give his disciples funky names (Rocky, the Brothers of Thunder, the Daggerman) rather than place names.  Ehrman claims "We do know of Jewish men from the time and place of Jesus who were single... (p. 155)" yet he fails to list a single one. Why? Because they are so few. It was inconceivable for a Jewish rabbi aged 30 in the 1st Century to be unmarried. William Phipp's excellent book Was Jesus Married provides good scholarship on this topic. Ehrman claims to have read it, but apparently he skipped that chapter.  Ehrman makes a school boy's error when he claims that the Essenes were celibate (p. 156). While it is true of one sect within the Essenes, there was another sect, noted by Josephus, who were married and allowed to reproduce.  These problems are not minor points. Yet even if they were, their sheer number is disturbing in a work that professes to separate "truth" from "fiction" in the works of another author. When Ehrman is working from such a self-exalted platform, it behooves him to insure that his own material is beyond reproach. This Ehrman does not do. 
 I would not recommend this book for a little kid.  I've got two 3 year old girls and it's way too loud and way too grown-up for little kids.  I don't think it's appropriate. We have Philadelphia Chickens too and I would rate that a 5 star.  That one is inspiring.  This one is like letting your kid watch Saturday Night Live 
 As "Everyman" opens, the main character has already passed away.  From here, the plot moves back and forth in time to see how his life has come to this point.  This includes three unsuccessful marriages and strained relationships with offspring.  Ultimately, "Everyman" concerns how quickly life can pass us by- how death can come and people can be ill even when they feel they should be young and healthy.  And that's just not fair.  Quote: "My God, he thought, the man I once was!  The life that surrounded me!  The force that was mine!  No "otherness" to be felt anywhere!  Once upon a time I was a full human being."  I honestly cannot figure out what it is with folks and this book.  I did not find it to be interesting, nor the characters compelling.  Although I realize that the point could be made that in titling his work "Everyman" Roth is insinuating that the main character is actually representative of any man (who might not be a good man at all), I cannot find this convincing considering that I am unsure of whether the average man early has passionate affairs with European models thirty some odd years their junior . .  . maybe they do.  The virtue of this book is in its look at how an average man reflects on his life and death, but this man is not "average" enough for that to be pulled off here 
 For wrestling fans it is obvious that an autobiography by this legend is a must for the collection. But what is missing from his chapter on WCW leaves a big gap that cannot be ignored and ultimately detracts from the work.  There was an angle aired during the Ron Simmons v Lex Luger "press conference" for the heavyweight title match where Lex uses a disgusting racial slur to draw heat (of the cheapest kind). The slur actually made it on the air on cable, but was cut when shown through syndication.  Watts spends several pages on why he felt Simmons deserved the push to wear the championship strap, but fails to mention anything about the angle used that perhaps was the worst ever from a major promotion in a business not known for good taste.   Simply, did Watts have a hand in creating the script? If he did, why did he feel he needed to fuel the fire of racisim to gain heat for the match? And, if Watts did not have anything to do with the angle, he certainly would have a recollection and opinion the issue.   Watts remembers conversations he had with wrestlers like Sting concerning the use of steroids and has opinions on a wide-range of subjects, hence not addressing this issue really questions the validity of the entire book.  The most moving section is excerpts of letters from young people when Watts was running the UWF. The words coming from youngsters with oftentimes terminal illnesses is very powerful. It shows the impact that wrestlers back when they worked territories for significant periods of time. They truly were seen as stars like pro baseball and football players & not like the cartoon characters that are seemingly pushed today.  I simply wish Watts did not suffer amnesia on an issue that defined not only his management of WCW, but himself as a person.             
 This book is written from a Christian perspective.  God, church, and fundamental Christian values are an integral part of the therapeutic method.  If such an approach is not appropriate for you, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I am returning this product as it doesn't work well as it is advertised. It takes longer time as well dough sticks too. I bought this assuming it will save my time, but instead it increased my work and frustration when I used it once it arrived.Even rotis become thick too and uncooked. This is not something which works for me and I would keep it. I wanted save others time , so that they won't try it and pay shipping charges without any reason while returning it back. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS especially for indian rotis 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I can sincerely state I will not read another.  The way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous. No one - and no one, speaks that way. It made the story feel rushed and stilted, and I am sad to say, much of the humor was lost on me. Something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it. I felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues. I found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly (something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them), and the abuse situations Ms. Coulter touched on, then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting. She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way. If she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed....miserably. Reading this book was an utter loss of time. Don't bother 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 First of all, I am a fan of Madonna's music (not all of it, but a lot of it) as well as a huge ABBA fan.   Now I realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists... and apparently it is here as well, but why can't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic?   Gimme Gimme Gimme (the ABBA song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple song to begin with (as many ABBA songs are) but the complicated arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made ABBA's songs interesting and fun to listen to.   But taking a few bars of the original song, repeating it over and over and over, adding a dance beat, various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece.   I think she would've been better off either following a similar chord progression to Gimme Gimme Gimme or just doing a cover...  Perhaps Benny and Bjrn should've stuck to their strict "no sampling" rule here!   For some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance... A good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is Acoustic Alchemy's "So Kylie" on their American/English album (the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what's going on, you'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression).   Now I'm not going to say "Hung Up" is a terrible song, because everyone has their own taste.  But I'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for me.. 
 I would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code.  The source code has bugs, and many many memory leaks.  It isn't even formatted correctly. In order to make sense of it, I had to tab and format it correctly. Not fun.  There are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes.  If you really want to know how X files work then get this book, otherwise skip it 
 This is a very uncomfortable boot.  It puts a lot of stress and strain on the ankle.  I wear some type of boot almost everyday but could not wear these for even a few minuets.  My daughters could not wear them either.  They do look cute though.  We returned these boots 
 After you strip away that which is intuitively obvious...there's not much here. There are some betting strategies if you're the type to bet $300 on a Pick 3 or $2,500 on a Pick 6. Otherwise, I'd give this book a miss 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I wrote a review for this movie and it disappeared. I would like to know why, but I'll try again.  I did not like this movie.  I love Jack Finney and he would not approve of this movie.  Here is this guy who is a few weeks away from getting married and he is writing love letters to a ghost.  What does this say about him?  I saw nothing in her letter that should have made him fall in love with her.  I felt the whole thing was bogus, the guy was a cheat to his fiance and he dumped her with no tears or emotion.  The fiance was clearly in love with him, but was probably lucky he dumped her.  He seemed deranged, even to his mother.  I didn't feel it was romantic at all and I love romantic movies (especially "magic of ordinary days").  ...and who was the girl he met in the cemetary?  ...an illegitimate daughter of the girl with the desk?  If so, wasn't she his own great, great granddaughter?  forget buying this.  watch "Lake House" instead.  It's a much better time travel movie 
 Like the previous reviewer I studied this book in detail, took all the exams which totaled over 1000 questions, scoring over 90% on each exam and still flunked the Broker's Exam. This after having passed the State Bar exam for attorneys on the first try. This book did not cover even 10% of what was on the exam. I emailed the authors and they never responded. This book is a complete piece of garbage. You cannot count on it for anything 
 This book was very disappointing.  After buying and enjoying "The House You Build," I looked forward to another book by Duo Dickinson.  The houses and pictures used in this book are practically all the same as in the other book.  How can such a fine company as Taunton publish such a copycat work?  The text content is very similar also.  
 This is a feel good book attempting to make an argument that people in business can be "professionals." By definition, business people exist to create and manage a business entity inorder to generate a profit. Professionals are licensed individuals. They are mandated by law is to protect the public's health, safety and welfare through the services that they provide to the community. This book is an attempt to corrupt and diminish the definition of professionalism.  
  In this film you get:   An old geriatric vampire that needs help walking around.  People that leave their bodies and become dual exposure "ghosts" yet they can interact with their surroundings as if they were corporeal.  People acting in the movie as though it was a silent film, even though it's not.  The weirdest death scene ever, someone gets buried alive in flour!  Even though I'm a fan of old horror movies, I had a real tough time with this film.  I wanted to like it, but there were so many problems with overacting, the lack of dialogue, and there's not much in the way of a coherent story.  I wouldn't be the least bit suprised to find out that there are bits of the film missing from this print.  It is very atmospheric and creepy, though.  The copy of the movie used here is damaged, the subtitles (what little dialogue there is is in German) are very poorly done, with large black boxes around the letters.  There's also a large black border all the way around the screen, so even though the film is the correct aspect ratio for full screen viewing, it is "letterboxed" all the way 'round.  Oh, and the sound is so low that even with it turned up all the way I could barely hear it.  This movie looks like it was made in 1922, not 1932.    The bonus film that you get with the DVD is actually better than the main attraction, with an excellent story and wonderful animation.  It's a pity that they had to tack it on to the main feature, probably because an old movie called "Vampyr" will sell, whereas an unknown film would not.  If you must see it, don't buy it, rent it 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 OK. I just got this CD today, and now i'm happy. Was late, but only got this album for "good morning beautiful" 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 About the only good thing to be said about Boston is that they aren't Rush 
 I have not recieved the book......please someone contact me NOW, this is the 2nd purchase I have made and not recieved my book! Very Upset!!!  Please help me! 
 This book not only had spelling errors and NO pictures, it actually said "Not ready for publishing" when I recieved it.  I got this for my dad as one of his christmas presents and I really wish I could get my money back 
 Nietzsche was destined to be cursed by the vapidity and foolishness of those closest to him: first his sister, and next his translator, Walter Kaufmann, who singlehandedly stifled all creative and thoughtful work on Nietzsche in English for much of the twentieth century, when it would seem to have been just getting started. Not only were his translations one-dimensional, not only was his view of Nietzsche fairly warped and condescending; but he spent most of his time not translating Neitzsche or doing thoughtful work in the community but rather destroying the careers of others by publishing nasty reviews which, due to his iron grip on the american philosophical societies, made it fairly impossible to publish on nietzsche if one hadn't earned his prior approval by kissing up. He was, in short, the very portrait of the arrogant know-it-all professor. To see this, one only has to look to his translations of Nietzsche, where he comments derisively on the works of others; chides Nietzsche for his views on women, his poetic capability, and his philosophical outlooks; and refers more to his own footnotes than the text in question. It becomes quickly apparent that W. Kaufmann sees himself as vastly more important than Nietzsche; even his biographical note at the end of the texts is almost twice as long as Nietzsche's!  Here he is no different; his view of Nietzsche is perhaps slightly more developed than some, but is not outstanding in any way. Besides, this is less about Nietzsche than about Kaufmann anyhow. The "Kaufmann freeze" has broken, and other people are publishing about Nietzche; it may be hard to find good books about him, but rest assured that this isn't one of them. Briefly: forget about this one, and also avoid any of Mr. Kaufmann's translations. Try Hollingdale, who isn't much better in the translation department, but at least doesn't detract from the text through arrogant footnotes 
 A mediocre story, poorly written and horribly read (by the author).The monotone of the reader is so bad that it takes a while to realize the shortcomings of the actual story.  The characters are one-dimensional, and the items that might make them more interesting are only hinted at, never explored.  There are far more well-written thrillers out there.  Take the time to find one of them, and leave Toyer on the shelf 
 Once again a new knitting book comes out and once again the publisher doesn't let us see what's inside.  Who buys knitting books without at least flipping through the pages to see what the projects look like?  I buy about 10 knitting books per year, many of them on Amazon.  Alot of things inform me about which books to buy -- past books of the designer or editor that I liked, projects, etc.  But the single most important thing that drives my spending is being able to see a sample of pictures of the projects contained in the book.  Why are so few knitting book publishers willing to show us what is inside their books on Amazon?    "One Skein Wonders" is another book that does NOT offer the potential buyer a view of what is inside?  I don't expect to see the patterns, but I do expect to see pictures of (at least some of) the projects.     Anne Lindenfel 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, US Defense Contractors were also on the verge of collapse, that is until someone had the bright idea of privatizing the government. Current government privatization efforts have resulted in huge contracts costing the American taxpayer double and triple the cost of the original government employees. This book is a Conservative Pipe Dream, a guide to a fantasy bureaucracy that never existed, and a bomb that has totally disrupted the efficient operation and security of the Federal Government 
 No real practical advise.   It seems to me that boundaries are somewhat personnel. Yet the author treats them as if they are absolutes.  Apparently someone asked her if she every had an abortion. She commented that such a person could never be her friend. Apparently because the person did not recognize the universality of the authors boundaries  She also tends to see men in a negative light; rapist, alcoholics, controlling, domineering. Women are portrayed as victims. 
 Al Qaida and Hezbollah would agree with the authors. Terrorism  aims to undermine Western Civilization and replace with it with an evil empire that would murder all Jews and those who love them. Walsh and Keesmaat, along with Stanley Hauerwas and most who teach "social ethics" at most Protestant and Roman Catholic seminaries, live in a fantasy persepctive that cannot see who constitutes the enemy. As an former smug liberal socialist and pacifist, I find these "ethicists" an embarassment and danger. If America, Britain and Israel, so does the whole of Western civilization. Walsh,Keesmaat and their crowd will be in prison with the rest of us. Will they be part of the resistance or will they collaborate with the enemy? I have always been in ministry to those of moderate income who understand what is the cost of freedom. African and Asian Christian immigrants to our nation understand that cost as well. Let Walsh and Keesmaat talk to those who grew up under Marxist regimes as well as those in exile from Saddam Hussein, the Taliban and the Iranian theocrats. They appreciate the Judaeo-Christian foundations that constituted America! The true prophets are Charles Colson, Jean Beth Elshtain, Richard John Neuhaus, Sean Hannity, Dennis Prager, Laura Ingraham, George Weigel and the Center for Ethics and Public Policy along with the Institute for Religion and Democracy as well as the journal First Things.

 The Prisoner of Azkaban  Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.  The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]  Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class? 
 Jaws was great, Jaws 2 was very good, Jaws 3 was bad - but zthis one is worse. I have Jaws and Jaws 2 on dvd and will keep them. I had Jaws 3 and Jaws - The Revenge on dvd - but I gave them away. They are not worth keeping!  Walte 
 Was really looking forward to this 2nd installment in the series, but was disappointed for the most part. Check it out at the local library instead of buying, is my advice 
 We enjoy Maxwell's look at leadership. This book hits on the subject of what if you are not the Boss can you still influence people. We thought it was so good we gave it as a gift to a friend to encourage him 
 The first thing that came to my so called mind after the completion of this film was, "What was Terry Zwigoff thinking?"  He is responsible for the documentary of Robert Crumb entitled `Crumb', which was one of the better films made in the last two decades.  `Bad Santa' was a very big surprise as well, so I am caught scratching my head as to why he decided this particular script and/or subject matter was worth making a feature presentation over.  For starters, people who are serious artists and who over-emphasize the importance of their craft are the most annoying people on the planet.  I can say that because I went through a department with this type of person.  They are self indulged and think so highly of what they're trying to say that it irritates me just thinking about it.  The fact is...they have nothing to say and what they are doing has very little significance to people who actually have talent (ie, those of us who don't need to "say" anything).  If Zwigoff focused on this and made a mockery of the entire `art-scene', that might be enough to make a entertaining film, but there isn't enough in here, really.  `Art School Confidential' gets too boggled down in a courtship where the main kid seemingly finds his first infatuation in a figure model at school.  The two of them are so uninteresting that it made me yearn for some art school-critique talk from some of the hippies in the film.  It tried too hard to go over the top with some of it's jokes (male models walking up to female students where her eye level is at his pelvis level, the obnoxious roommate who offers nothing but `can I smell your finger' quirks).  It would have been nice if the story actually followed this student, who knew he was better than everyone else (and he was), ridicule the rest of the students who had absolutely nothing to offer the world (which is, essentially, about 98% of all "artists").  Instead it turns into your standard, boy tries to impress girl by stealing someone else's artwork who just happens to be a serial killer story.  Wrong direction.  There are/were too many opportunities to make fun of these types passed up for something that's been overdone way too many times.  Terry should have known better!  There is a very entertaining Thanksgiving Dinner scene, which was worth two stars from me.  The overbearing female who takes her artwork way too seriously even though it's complete trash was also amusing, so that earns two stars.  Just not enough irritating art-scene comedy in here to recommend it at all 
 Did not purchase.....there was no look inside to see if it was what I was looking fo 
 I like Jonathan Anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one.  
 I read all Jonathan Kellerman books, but this one put me to sleep. I was disappointed. I also think he should resolve this love interest and get Robin back. Allison needs to go. His books were better with Robin. These issues get boring after awhile 
 The Corporation will find any way it can to squeeze more cash out of any platinum "artist". Jewel was a perfect candidate with her bloated, exaggerated tales of growing up in a van in Alaska and pure angelic features. Why would anyone think that a singer with lyrics like, "my hands are small, I know, but they're not yours, they are my own," can write anything that even remotely resembles decent prose? Her poems are nothing more than scattered, broken phrases that are, at worst, unbelievably incoherrent and at best, prime kindergarten-like tales of unrequited love and child-like observation. It's a hard cold fact that the only reason she was allowed to publish such trite poetry is solely because of her platinum cd sales. Anyone who believes that this stuff is good, must either be a loyal follower or the most basic of amatuer readers of prose, and must be taken to the nearest library immediately for an emergency infusion of Frost, Yates or Angelou. You would find more artistic merit in a car manual then Jewel's laughable prose.      
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 I was SO disappointed when I opened the package.  The sheets are literally see through and as rough as burlap.  Horrible quality material on the sheets.  The comforter is nice.  My son loves it.  I am going to end up spending more money on solid colored sheets that are softer and more comfortable.  I would NEVER sleep on sheets like this and don't expect my child to.  SO SAD because my son loves star wars so much.  SHAME on whoever would manufacture such an uncomfortable product for children!  I have yet to wash the comforter...I am afraid to.  I DO NOT recommend this set to anyone unless you have another use for the sheets.  It is not worth $60 by any means 
 This would be the LAST place I would send someone to get a taste of Al Franken. The first half of the book makes the same jokes over and over and over and over again, and throughout, you really need to know a lot of Washington inside stuff to get the jokes. In some ways a sharp expose of our political and media system, and in other ways far, far, far too long with the general feel of a train wreck 
 I just reread it in a collection of Nobel Prize winning authors--their acceptance speeches etc., and this story and "As I Lay Dying" were chosen as examples of his work. This story!!! It's such a mundane little macabre "gotcha" story, over-anthologized for high school students (along with other tired stories like "The Most Dangerous Game"). Faulkner is such an incredible writer--I'm reading Fury in the Dust right now, and his sentences--the Nobel Prize committee described them as being "as powerful as Atlantic rollers". What was he thinking when he wrote "A Rose for Emily"? Obviously not much. Read anything else by him, you'll have a better time 
 I actually bought this book from Amazon awhile ago and just read it.  It took me 3 weeks because I kept putting it down after a few pages.  Boringville.  This was my first Alice Hoffman book and more than likely, my last.  I could not stand the main character.  She deserved to get hit by lightning just because of all the whining about what she thought she did to her mother.   The whole sexual thing with Lazurus wasn't erotic either.  It was just "icky" and uninteresting.   The only interesting person in this story was Ned's wife.  So, to all you fellow reviewers who didn't like it, I'm right there with you 
 the subject is not an exaggeration, unless you are a mother this book is the biggest drag i've ever come across.  Franky this, Franky that, it's so repetitive, predictable and juvenile.  soooooo tacky, such a week and dwindling plot words cannot describe, this is the "gili" of the literary world.  I hope to sway at least one person from buying this book, just so my purchase will be justified 
 A more appropriate title for this book is "Interviews with folks who are selling their own get rich or personal books, who happen to be millionaires through the product they are peddling -- Robert Allen style". This includes Mr. Amos and the 1-800-flowers guy, they are selling their own books. Besides all of the rhetoric hype, there is no valuable insight to wealth building. No meat. Each person simply explains the philosophy of their product/book and Litman announces how to goto their website plus their 800 number. There are some tidbits but they accumulate to less than 10% of this thin book. The first four interviews, nearly half of the book, contain zero value. They appear to be added as filler.  That said, two of the books featured "The Emyth" and "Rich Dad Poor Dad", are excellent books. I recommend buying these books directly instead of pecking for crumbs from this book 
 King Kong: The Island of the Skull by Matthew Costello  	I hate to be one of those people who talks about how he was really into the current big thing long before the big thing was big.  Like the people who talk about how they really liked the Ramones back when they lived next door to them in New Jersey and used to hear the practice in their garage, or people who really loved the Richard Bachman novels long before they knew they were actually written by Stephen King.  I don't want to be that guy, but long before Peter Jackson made it big with The Lord of the Rings I was really into his movies and I thought he was a stellar talent.  The rest of the world merely caught up. 	 	I'm also a really big fan of the original King Kong.  Where most film students point to the over praised Citizen Kane as the seminal American art movie, I always point to King Kong.  The movie had everything: state of the art special effects, a hot chick in peril, dinosaurs, monsters, panic in the streets and startling sequences that are absolutely and forever unforgettable.  It might not be the greatest movie ever made, but it's surly in the top ten.  	Remaking the movie was inevitable, and it happened before. Dino De Laurentiis did it in 1976, and it was a complete turd.  Kong clambered to the top of the World Trade Centers then, and it's arguably the worst disaster to hit those buildings ever.  I remember being a kid and looking at some promotional art for the movie.  Kong stood atop the WTC towers, one leg on each, holding an exploding jet plane in his hand.  Of course, in the movie Kong wasn't nearly large enough to do this, he had to run and leap from one tower to the next, and he was killed by helicopters.  I also remember there being a lot of press built around a gigantic robotic  Kong built to scale for use in some scenes in the movie.  The robot looked completely lame, completely fake, and nothing like the actor in the suit playing Kong in the rest of the movie.  The robot got about five seconds of screen time.  	Kong has suffered a lot since the 1933 movie.  He gained electrical powers in 1962 and fought Godzilla, and in 1967 had to fight a robot version of himself called Mecha-Kong in King Kong Escapes.  (Mecha-Kong was controlled by the villainous Dr. Who, related, perhaps to the British television series?)  There was a terrible animated television series based on Kong that had a pretty kicking theme song:  King Kong! You know the name of  King Kong! You know the fame of  King Kong! Ten times as big as a man!   Throughout the land you've heard about this wonder.  Listen closely and you will hear the thunder  Oft this mighty ape and he's a friend of man.  So goes the legend, the legend of...   King Kong! You know the name of  King Kong! You know the fame of  King Kong! Ten times as big as a man!  One day a boy, too young to know the danger;  Made a friend of this giant fearsome stranger!  And the life they led on their island home  Became a legend, the legend of...   King Kong! You know the name of  King Kong! You know the fame of  King Kong! Ten times as big as a man!  	Despite all the terrible things that have happened to Kong I'm confident that Peter Jackson will still pull off a spectacular remake.  Everything I've seen from the movie so far has been knocking me out.  I really think that this will be the big budget Hollywood film we've been waiting for all year.  The movie comes out December 14, 2005, which seems a long time. 	 	So I picked up King Kong: The Island of the Skull which is billed on the cover as "The official prequel novel to the Universal Pictures movie event!"  It's written by Matthew Costello, whose "...innovative work includes groundbreaking and award-winning novels, games and television shows."  If true, all his innovation and ground-breaking would need to be brought to bear on a novel in which none of the main characters can be allowed to meet, the big monster, Kong, can only be heard and not seen, and contains no scenes or ideas that might be better or cooler than the movie to come.  	The book bounces around three separate plot-lines.  We follow the adventures of Ann Darrow, (played in the movie by Naomi Watts) a down-on-her-luck actress, as she becomes desperate for cash and finds a job diving horses off a pier in Atlantic City and avoids gangsters.  Girls diving horses off piers to the applause of paying customers seems weird today, but it's real.  See here. (http://www.petticoated.com/pdqwinter04/otherdocs/divinghorsesW04.html)  	We also follow filmmaker and adventurer Carl Denham (played in the movie by Jack Black) as he heads up a disastrous expedition to the artic in search of killer whales. His best friend loses a leg to a pack of sea lions, and Jack nearly loses the funding for future projects.  Big deal.  Both Carl Denham and Ann Darrow have real stories in King Kong.  All this is just back story disguised as a novel, somewhat interesting, but rather pointless.  	The best part of the book, and the only part that actually matters, is the stuff with Sam Kelly, a former Navy diver who joins an ill-fated Portuguese pearl ship that meets its desperate end near Skull Island, home of Kong.  Sam's story is interesting, a does provide some interesting context to what comes later.  The map Sam draws will ultimately come into the possession of Carl Denham, and this map will lead the crew to Skull Island and the legendary rendezvous with King Kong.  	Three plots may seem like a lot to cram into 328 pages, but it isn't.  The story arc of any of these characters would barely qualify as a short story anywhere else.  The book is slowly paced, especially at the beginning, and is padded with nonsensical asides and odd thoughts from the characters.  Take this bit, from page 51.  Ann is in Atlantic City, looking for the famous Steel Pier and a job with the diving horses.  		"Is it really steel, she wondered?  Why would you make a pier out of steel?  Wouldn't wood be better? Or was that just dumb?"  	I'd go with just dumb.  It's like somebody said fill 300 pages no matter what and the writer just went back over the manuscript over and over again, throwing in any old thing he could think of to spread it out and fill the space.  Innovative and ground-breaking indeed.  	Books like this are unfortunate.  The studio probably knew they couldn't get by releasing the old Joe DeVito adaptation of the original movie, it's been in the public domain for years.  They needed something they could stamp their "Official Movie Merchandise" symbol on, and they got it.  Unfortunately the novel is pointless and unsatisfying.  	Despite this, there are some things that tweaked the fan in me.  I love good solid historical details like the diving horses bit at the Steel Pier.  I like the historical verisimilitude such details provide.  I love it when fictional characters and historical figures interact.  At one point in the novel Carl Denham runs into Eugene O'Neill, famed playwright and author of Mourning Becomes Elektra.  It's the kind of fun, throwaway scene I wish there were more of.  	The second bit that intrigued me is much more sinister and weird.  On page 305 a native girl from Skull Island is dying in Sam Kelly's arms"  	"She opened her mouth, and said words in her language.  `Ka-neh, ry-leh nah.'"  	Fans of HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos stories will know what I'm talking about.  Ryleh is the island, somewhere in the south seas, where the dread Cthulhu lies, waiting to destroy the world.  It's an island of insanity, monsters, and non-Euclidean geometry.  Has Matthew Costello slipped a Cthulhu reference into the King Kong mythology?  It couldn't be an accident.  Costello should know the horror genre, having scripted the video games The 7th Guest and DOOM 3 
 I opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype.This is the worst smelling perfume-ever.When I put it on it smelled like burnt clothing-like an iron had just done it's worst on cotton.It was so awful I put it straight in the bin 
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 This book is somewhat helpful but hopelessly outdated. Ukraine is changing rapidly and this book just is not of much use at all! See if you can buy it used, but don't waste your money on a new copy 
 I really can't see the purpose of this book for either buyers or sellers. McBroom gives very little information about the cameras themselves, certainly not enough for anyone to make a decision about whether to buy a particular camera -- in many cases he gives only a price. Moreover, he restricts himself to only relatively common and recent cameras for which more accurate pricing information is readily available from eBay 
 Looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used.  The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers 
 As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action 
 This book was definitly an interesting read, but I feel like its lacking in substance.  Johnson tries to prove, for example, that todays television shows make us smarter than those of the 70's because they require a viewer to keep track of more characters and plot lines. But he fails to prove that this is a valid way of measuring complexity, or that keeping track of more plot lines and characters actually makes you think a substantial amount more. He doesn't actually analyze many television shows to prove this statistic, but chooses a few TV shows that he believes are representative of the era. To really prove the point, I think one would need to come up with some sort of data for all shows on television at a given time, but he does not. Even if he does convince you that TV is smarter today than in the 70's, that doesn't mean it makes you smarter than you would be if you hadn't watched TV at all.   He formulates similar opinions for movies, and games as well.  His writing is quick and easy to read, though I thought it a little redundant. Also, the citations annoy  me. There aren't any. But in the back of the book, there are sentences referencing studies and an explanation. The problem is that many information that is stated as fact is not cited at all in the back. And its hard to pick out since there aren't any footnotes or anything of that nature to let you know what information he aquired from reputable sources and what information is opinion stated as fact.  Overall, I'd spend your money on something else 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 Snoozer.  Very self-indulgent 
 I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).    I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.  Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.  "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.   
 I didn't like the typos, I didn't like the inaccuracies, and for god sake don't give away so many spoilers.  I hadn't read the fifth book and he gave away something crucial, thanks alot.  I wanted to read about Ms. Rowling, if I wanted parts of the book ruined I would have asked someone in my home who read the book to do it thanks 
 Over the years, I owned several Proton radios.  Beautiful design, great sound - WHEN they worked.  Repairs were costly and time-consuming.  Nevertheless, I purchased a Sangean radio from Amazon.  It lasted two months - then, no volume.  I now have three broken Proton/Sangean radios in storage - if only to remind me to never again buy their products 
 I found the basic idea of this story as interesting and I was excited to read a story that dealt with racial equality, etc. However, I felt that the story was a little too far fetched and so many of the situations did not seem realistic or plausible at all. Also, during the short span of time that this story took place pretty much every character was having a pretty significant life revelation, discovery, exposure, etc. etc. I know the author was just trying to bring home the point of the book, but for me it was so extreme that it was not believable at all. There seemed to be many long dialogue passages between the different characters that said the same things over and over again.  I wasn't really excited about this book, and the characters just did not grab me. I did appreciate the main idea of racial equality and thought about the things the characters said. This is my first book by this author. 
 In my experience, people with really provincial taste in literature like Saunders because they think he's "edgy."  He's funny, I guess, and if you only read the New Yorker and Best American Short Stories, his plots are unusual, even original.  Even better, he sniffs at suburban consumer culture, painting it in the most garish colors imaginable.  What's an overeducated, culturally aspirational hipster not to love? Many other reviewers here call Saunders "compassionate," which seems really very wrong to me.  The characters are so broadly drawn that it's hard not to think he's offering them up to us as figures of ridicule or even scorn.  He never forces his readers out of their comfort zones, to actually feel something for or maybe -- gasp! -- identify with his grotesques. Compassion is hard, and these stories take the easy ways out.  Saunders can find it if he wants, but until then I suggest his readers look for it too.  Elsewhere 
 THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO.      THANK YOU. 
 This is one of the most confusing and dis-organized books that I have ever read.  Unfortunately, since it's required reading for some classes, I feel sorry for anyone that has to suffer the wrath of C programming morons such as the author of this book.  I highly recommend suicide before suffering through this book as a reference.  I would recommend that you search elsewhere to learn about data structures in C 
 True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions.  On my couch the mouse is dead. If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive. But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky.  Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse.... I am returning this product.  Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen.  
 Book offers meaningless tasks to deliver. Too much time reading, and too much time wasted if applied. 
 This book is totally useless.  I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail.  This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any "free" money anywhere.  Keep the money you have 
 The author operates under the assumption that the knowledge and wisdom gained from participation with AMOs is not applicable elsewhere.  This is a false assumption.  The facts are these:  My wife and I spent over 6 years in that business and only marginally participated in the "system" available.  From the "system", we learned enough to make ourselves highly competitive and successful in other endeavors.  So, while we did not put forth the necessary effot to make a successful Amway business, we did apply the knowledge from the AMO in other business effotts, which have proven very successful 
 Based on an article in the Wall Street Journal and the previous reviews, I bought this book, and Missing Links by Dan Jenkins, for my father-in-law, an avid golfer and reader.  He was so disgusted by the language in both books (the c-word, f-word etc. "on every page") that he returned them 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written.  There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading.  Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment.  It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book 
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 Full of holes and alot of overbearing personal philosophy.  I found myself crossing out lines of this text, as so much of this is conjecture and hyperbole.  The chapter on Violence is worth the cost of the book, however, I would recommend going to the library and saving your money.  Some directors swear by this text, thusly it is a potent force in the contemporary theatre.  However, many of these ideas have been chewed up and misused by so many inexperienced Bogart groupies that it has little more validity than, say, a Richard Foreman text in its extremely self-referential nature.  
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 Bok begins his book in a manner similar to a historian, revisit antiquity, become oblivious to why it failed to survive said antiquity, and proclaim its fortunes and virtues; however, Bok opens with the rather sheepish statement that colleges never have been overachieving and students never involuntarily choose work.  In short, there was no golden age of collegiate education.  Bok's writing is a bit of an enigma throughout the book.  One moment he has nothing but praise for modern research in educational methods, the next moment he says the same research is unreliable and colleges should engage in their own self-study and ideological changes.   Bok does make the rather insightful comment (in any other age I would say painfully obvious ) that if colleges want students to write more eloquently and speak more loquaciously then they should be taught by people who speak and write well.  Put their money where their mouth is so to speak. Bok proceeds to analyze a smorgasbord of educational methods, the only one of which has any supporting benefits, a study of the great literature of civilization. He quickly dismisses this because he thinks the study is too broad focused. (Bok also thinks knowledge of statistics is more important than reason and causality, a point made painfully clear by his lack of causal understanding throughout the book.)  Bok refuses to mention who educational changes really help, do they help the best students or the worst students?  Who should you help?  Bok's narrow-mindedness on science is annoyingly deplorable.  At a faculty meeting he stated undergraduate science surveys should allow the understanding of science and nature journals.  A Nobel prize winner in chemistry told him that even he did not understand those journals! Bok really wants colleges to do more, achieve something; however he refuses to make clear what exact goals a college should have and worse yet, he refuses to acknowledge any attempt to provide a yardstick to measure progress.  In such, he spends the greater part of the book lamenting that colleges need to do something to improve, and once they do the education research will tell them why it worked. 
 Actually, I would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. CityLips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. BUT the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  Worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  True, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale!  
 This book is almost like watching an episode of "The Real World." You follow a semi-interesting person around for a few weeks, watch them experience some amazing highs, some disasterous lows and lots and lots and lots of average ordinary daily humdrum. There is the a fiery girlfriend whom our subject waffles about. There are the odd and sometimes obnoxious friends who try to sound deep and sometimes succeed. There is lots of pot and alcohol to keep life on an even keel, if that is how you have to get by. And there is no real resoultion. Seriously, is the whole Judaic thing supposed to hold this story together? Is there some obscure Kabbalistic point to this mess? It sounds like there is supposed to be. There are hints of it here and there throughout the story. But it doesn't really hold up. At first I thought the book was just quirky, and I like quirky so I kind of got into it. And then there were really great flashes of brilliance in the events and the prose and I was like, "Sure, this is a slice of life story about, well, life, belief and the little things that keep us sane and keep us moving," and I got into that too. But then the story just kind of ends with no real resolution to ANY of the major plot points that are left hanging in the wind along with the reader. Seriously, and I will say this again because I hate when authors foist this on an unsuspecting audience, all of the big events leading up to the end that cry out for explanation and resolution and reprecussion are simply dropped. Is this a Zen ending? Actually the book ends where it tells you it is going to end about halfway through, with Alex doing the Kaddish for his dead Chinese father (who never converted to Judaism). The only problem is that Alex tells you over and over again that this ceremony means nothing to him. He doesn't believe in any of it. And through the prose of the final pages, not only does it not continue to mean anything to him, even in the act, but it doesn't even mean much to the audience who are listening to him go through the motions, including three Rabbis. No revelation. No change. Not even a bit of comfort for the road. Just a very flat ending for, as it turns out, a very flat book. The only thing I can figure is that this is some sort of morality play about how little religious belief truly affects our daily lives and who we are as people. In retrospect, it seems like reading this wasn't an uplifting nor a depressing experience. It was simply no experience at all. Hey, maybe that makes it Zen after all 
 Thisis book gives a lot of stratgies but does not give many examples of how to implement those strategies, and thus rendering the materials given in this book not very useful 
 This is one of the worst books that I was required to read for my MBA program. I didnt benefit anything from reading the book. The authors of this book should not be considered "authors", and people should be paid to read such a book!!  When you read the book, you will understand what I say (if you have to read it). The Authors think that readers are coming from the moon or maybe Mars, and that they don't know the clear obvious in their life 
 I never really saw what was so great about Iggy Pop.  He was hyper and screamed.  so what?  So does my two year old son 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 After reading Maureen Dowd's article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do?" in the October 2005 New York Times, I immediately ordered this book. Maureen Dowd's writing is certainly entertaining, and she is obviously a sharp intuitive writer. Are Men Necessary, however, is one of the most jumbled books I have ever read. Throughout the book, she lacks a clear unifying point and she often reuses information. I felt like I jumped into a crazy stream of consciousness and was never oriented.  Maureen Dowd obviously was well researched when she wrote this. Her witty sarcastic writing often masks her lack of a clear path. The book was entertaining, and at times, thought provoking, until the last chapter.  The final chapter was ultimately a tribute to Hilary Clinton. Dowd does not clearly conclude her book; instead, she aimlessly hopes that in a dreadfully long tribute the reader can come to some sense of finality.  Nevertheless, if you are interested in this topic, please check out her article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do." It is wonderful and well worth the 15 minute read. 
 Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value.    Value???  At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer.  With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special?  What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag.  Firstly, the packaging.    The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate.  The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top.  The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer.  Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect.  Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature.    In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature.  Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set.  All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc.      At approximately 7.5" x 7.5" x 7.5", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs.  OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music?  This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in.  Let's take it album by album.  First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks.  These are:  I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts ("Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" / "When Will the Bells Ring for Me?") and  slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts ("A Time for Love" / "The Shining Sea") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of "pointless" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered:  Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion.  Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s.  This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia.  It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection.  However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s.  Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia?  Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least.  Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form.  I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release.  The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the "This Is All I Ask" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the  tracks from "This Is All I Ask" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release.  For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks "If I Love Again" (alternate take) / "Someone To Love" (alternate take) / "Indian Summer".  So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album.  The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless:  The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another "Greatest Hits" variant is completely pointless.  Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over.  Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation.   Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans.  Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason.  This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release.  When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain).  An absolute gem.  More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed.  So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful?  One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album,  three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in,  one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless "hits" collection.    Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday.  Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery.  If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135.  Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves?   This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year.  (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen.  Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen.  Go figure.  You know what they say about the number 13 - "...unlucky for some...".  In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)                  
 Like beauty, greatness is in the eye of the beholder. Alan Wolfe's concept of greatness sharply differs from this reviewer's view of greatness. While he claims to be a "Liberal" Kerry voter, he does not promote the classical liberal thought of a Lockean, and is intolerant of other views of greatness.  Rather, like many of today's "progressives" his "Liberalism" is a perversion.  It calls for a strong coercive government that destroys any existence of individualism.  His heros are Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.  What makes them heros is that they all succeed in increasing the power of the central government while actively ignoring the true intent of the US Constitution.  The obligations that one has towards his fellow citizens are not self imposed, but are decided by and enforced by a strong central government bureacracy.  Indeed, Wolfe's idealogy is highly nationalisic and intolerant.  It is basically a fascist ideal where the will and the identity of the individual is destroyed.  Greatness (as opposed to goodness) comes from government strength.  Wolfe's desired Leviathan could easily violate the basic freedoms that many have given their lives to defend.  This reviewer believes that both America's goodness and greatness have come from her people, and not from government force or military might.  Without the force of government, the great Americans of yesterday and today freely place restrictions on themselves in order to improve life for themselves and their fellow world citizens. America's great people come from all walks of life. She is a school teachers, business owner, a loving parent, a little league players, or she is just an infirmed lady who can rise above her own pains to freely give some of what little money she has to the tsunami victims in Southeast Asia.  If she were forced to give of herself as Wolfe would advocate, then she has lost her right to be good, generous, and helpful.  Greatness comes from within the individual and can never be imposed by government power.  A country can never be great if its citizens are treated as livestock, and this is the reason that Wolfe's vision fails.  If his vision is ever implemented, the US will go the way of many failed regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and many innocent lives will be lost along the way 
 I purchased this book because I am a new dog owner and because Cesar is so helpful on his show I thought the book would be too.  It's basically a story of his life.  Who cares?  I was looking for detailed ways to get my puppy to stop jumping, barking at the cat, get house broken, etc.  NOT a book talking about where Cesar grew up and how he came to America at the age of 21.  This book does nothing to help new dog owners train their dog.    In one section that tells you what needs to be done to break bad habits but doesn't explain how you go about breaking the habits.  For example, one chapter starts off saying "If you're dog does this how do you talk to them?  Do you yell?  Do you treat them like a baby?  Obviously you know this isn't working but you don't know how to talk to the dog to get results."  So I kept reading to find out how I should talk to and discipline my dog.  It never tells you how to go about talking to your dog.  Instead it talks about energy in dogs in the wild and human energy.  What difference does that make?  I have a boxer, not a wolf.  And as for discipline?  How is one supposed to discipline their dog?  Obviously you don't want to hit the dog or verbally abuse it but it never tells you what the proper discipline technique is.....just to discipline your dog.  It also says a lot to make your dog calm down before you feed them, when you get home from work, when you wake up, etc. so it's not acting like a raving lunatic and obeys you.  So please tell me how I get them to calm down?  It never tells you.  I was very disappointed in this book and wish I spent my money on another training book.  If you're looking for a book to help train your dog DON'T GET THIS BOOK 
 This man is like Michael Bay.  Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies.  The man is a joke 
 I only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so I returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge.  
 This product is absolutely worthless, especially in the hot Texas summer.  The pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit.  It is still blazing hot when you get inside.  Don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of garbage.  Better to leave your windows down or park under a tree 
 I'm surprised to see some fairly recent reviews (2004)praising this set. Folks, this is a high price to pay for eight movies, when you can get Universal's recently released "Legacy" series for about $20 a pop.  Because the "Legacy" series crams an average of five movies onto each two-disk set, the picture quality isn't as rich as it could be.  (Keep in mind, though that the Universal Monster Collection was released relatively early in DVD history, and I don't think the images were cleaned up all that much. I certainly found my old VHS copy of "The Mummy" far superior to the single-disk version I bought early on. The "Legacy" series improves the picture and sound, even though neither is perfect.  Universal has released "Legacy" series for Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Mummy. Each set features the original Universal movie, plus three or four sequels.  The Frankenstein Legacy Collection, for instance, features all three Karloff outings, plus House of Frankenstein and Ghost of Frankenstein.  The Mummy Legacy Collection features the Karloff original, plus Mummy's Hand, Ghost, Tomb and Curse.  All for a great price.  Check it out and save your money 
 I received a gift certificate in mid December for my birthday, ordered this item, the shipping date was pushed out several times, this week it was bumped again with the expected possible date to ship now April 29.  Very disappointed I never received it. I see so many others received it and have great reviews-where was mine? 
 I was looking for something like this for months.  It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search.  Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed.  My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out.  During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time.  After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died.  I haven't even begun to look for a new one.  Very disappointe 
 Although the music is ok,,, the songs lack a general appeal like those found on trip (a far superior and spiritual album) the success of this group borders on the demographic that enjoys a depeche mode spinoff. sorry to say I did not find this album as enjoyable. But will add it to my library of music nonetheless 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 This film just goes to show that when Hollywood wants to make money they turn everyone into a tramp. This happened to all involved in "Friend" (hardly an appropriate title). I only hope the ASPCA stepped in sometime and sued because of animal cruelty and the film's promoting of the perpetuation of cruelty to animals. And I hope writer/director John Lafia is real proud of himself.  He just sent the need for and recognition of animal rights back to the stone age. Only redeming factor was Lance Henriksen's work. He did the best with what he had to work with as usual 
 this cd sucks. they have turned more and more commercial as time goes by. don't get me wrong, i love the unseen, but this album and anything after it sucks by them. get their early stuff. they sound like anti-flag here except different vocals. it sucks 
 The first sentence in this book goes like this..." I never met Bill Hicks..." Well, that does not up the authors credibility for me. I quit the book halfway through because it lacked cohesion. This book could stand to have an editor and another editor whip through it 
 I have read all books from this author. What can I say? His first and second were good. I don't know what happened, but the quality of his books have been falling since then. The book is full of examples of what can you do to bring a little "show" into your "business", too bad it's written for those few people who get to manage a huge brand, or have something of an unlimited budget to play with! Of course I'd like to have live shows for my customers! Of course launching a watch at a fancy New York dance club sounds cool! Of course I'd love a theme park or a museum of my own! After reading some pages you start wondering if Schmitt is writing for someone to read this book or he's just trying to sell his consulting business. After reading pearls like:"if you're starting a $150 million promotional campaign...", I just had to close this book and look for something more interesting to do. (There's a long time I leave a book unfinished, but this one is entitled to this honor). Get real.. 
 Bruner raises some interesting points and rather validly questions some of the developments in psychology and the search for meaning.  However, his points, which are delightfully simple, are somehow lost in a sea of convoluted sentences and meaningless words.  His examples makes this book only accessable to the trained gurus.  It could have been a great commentary, but I ended up so frustrated sometimes that I would lose track of what Bruner was arguing 
 This author babbles on about horrific case histories & never does get to the point. This book grossly lacks anything the reader can use to keep their pets healthy in any shape or form. I was very annoyed. Thanks, Lyn 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 This book is NOT for children 4-8 unless they have never attended school. The writing is infantile and without meaningful content. The topic of Peace deserves a deeper and more mature treatment if children are to learn that peace is more than empty, warm-fuzzy words.The eight year old children in my class asked 'why didn't the book talk about peace?' Other comments of class members, based on the book's definitions of peace: , 'mom and dad hold hands but dad beats mom;' 'dad promised to take me to Sunday school but never came after me;' 'what song can we sing to bring dad home from Irag?' 'If they ring the Liberty Bell will peace stop the bad guys that killed my uncle(a police officer)?' I cannot recommend this book and feel it was very expensive for 75 words (prepositions not counted) 
 I had this unit for about 6 months one day smelled somthing getting hot. Reached behind the computer a touched the power supply and it was hot enough to blister my finger. I don't think I need any more of these 
 This is the worst book ever written!  It's obvious the author doesn't know what he is writing about.  Not only that, this book is poorly written and contains no real information.  The more you read, the more you wonder why you are reading.  Where is this book taking me?  What is the point of this book?  There is no point.  Absolutely no point at all.  It appears the author is merely trying to benefit from the fame of a dead Hollywood actress.  If Lucy only knew!  I spent three hours with this book and it saddens me that I'll never get those three hours back.  I also hope this book was printed on recylcled paper because it would be a real shame if a tree gave up its life for this.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this book to anyone. 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience.  This book, sadly, does not rank among them.  It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  Read another Hamilton instead 
 I agree with the reviewer below -- Njal's Saga is an amazing piece of work, but Cook's translation is garbage. Track down the Magnusson edition 
 Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money 
 Well I bought this book hoping that I could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and I dislike processed cereals. I am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries. All I have to say is that the recipes that I have tried taste alright but the timing is off. Some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour 
 Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.  Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.  The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.  
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.  
 The language in this "novel" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is 
 This is a great book if you don't have the two it is copied from; I was TOTALLY disappointed and felt ripped off because I do have them. The acknowledgements in this book clearly state that pages 8-11, 12-14, 15-139, and 140-261 are from the original two books-  DUH, that's just about the whole book!  what a disappointment, would not have bought if I had known it was just a reprint 
 The redoubtable Hobb is floundering in tepid waters with Shaman's Crossing.  As a long-time fan of hers, I was looking forward to another great read. Alas, not to be.  Nevare Burvelle is the most unbelievably naive young man I've yet to encounter.    Hobb's setting is a mishmash of the antebellum South and early Nineteenth century England, with American plains indians and "Specks" tossed in for good measure.  The result is a bubbling brew of racism, aristocratic intolerance, environmental disaster, and rampant militarism.  One would think that these ingredients ought to create an incendiary stew capable of blowing Gernia into another solar system. Instead, when the mess is finally ignited, there is barely a "poof".  Shaman's Crossing begins with a "bang".  The opening pages are the typical Hobb's "grabber".  She's off and running, I think. And she stays on course until Nevare begins his lengthy convalescence.  From that point, it's all downhill.  There's little action, and even less cohesion to the story.   Shaman's Crossing is neither worthy nor representative of Robin Hobb.  Hopefully, she pulls it together in book two. 
 Poorly written and utterly unoriginal, this book gave nothing by way of practical help or even encouragment.  Honestly, I wasnt even able to finish it.  A total waste of time and money 
 Although the book has some good tips I had trouble getting started and once I did well lets put it this way i did not stick with it for long. The only reason I am keeping the book is because it list alot of foods and how much protein, carb, fat information is in them. They hype the book up and I fell in hook line and sinker. I guess that old saying applies right about know " If it sounds to good to be true Etc...." 40 carb 30 protien 30 fat dont cut it. But I did figure out how to loose weight and keep it off; Its simple I got off my lazy butt started to excersise ate better and walla 10lbs lighter and working for more AND HERES THE CATCH ITS FREE walking 30min and common sense tells you wich foods in your fridge are good and bad for you 
 It's always interesting to read a Marxist view of anything to get a vastly different perspective from the usual liberal and conservative views (and the few moderate views that manage to find their way into print).    At bottom, the problem with the news media, according to McChesney, is that it's not far enough to the Left!  He rejects the criticism of the media's liberal bias.  This rejection is based on an eccentric use of the term "liberal".  For instance, Bill Clinton and Al Gore are "moderate to conservative Democrats" (p. 102).  "The Left" consists of radicals and "social democrats". (p. 103)  He sees both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton as "neoliberals": "with the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, the neoliberal moment had commenced.  Neoliberal ideology became hegemonic not only among Republicans but also in the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman."  (p. 49)  McChesney opposes professionalism in journalism, because professionalism "is a journalism of fact without regard to" a political ideology. (p. 67).  "The claim that it is possible to provide neutral and objective news" is suspect. (p. 68)  Professionalism refuses "to place every important issue in a larger political ideology." (p. 71)    He deplores the influence of corporations on news broadcasting (Don't we all?), but he also deplores NPR and PBS: "NPR and PBS at a national level tend to provide a bland variant of mainstream and conventional journalism" (p. 245).  So, the root problem is that even NPR and PBS are not far enough to the Left!    He wants unlimited funding of these public media without any overseeing or accountability.  (Perhaps a Constitutional Amendment--although he doesn't actually propose such a thing or say how this would otherwise be achievable.)  One wonders why he is so sanguine that he would be happy with a public news broadcasting source that was not answerable to anybody.  Is it because he assumes that it would be run by insiders who share his Marxist views?  He would certainly not be happy with it otherwise.  (See, in this connection, the film "Shattered Glass".)  Bottom line: Skip this book and buy Don't Blame the People or Freedom of the Press--for Whom?   
 Big suprise, dogs know that we aren't dogs.  The gig is up, dogs don't relate to us the way they relate to dogs.  Get a book that really teaches you how dogs think and learn 
 "River Run Red" is a retelling of tired old lies.  In 1871 a Congressional investigation cleared Nathan Bedford Forrest not only of his alleged involvement with the KKK but also reinvestigated the "Ft. Pillow Massacre" and found that were that while there was evidence that there were isolated incidents along the riverbank Forrest personally stopped them as soon as he arrived on-scene.  If there was so much "proof" of a "massacre" why was Forrest not charged with a crime even after an in-depth Congressional investigation?  Forrest took 39 United States Colored Troops (USCT) as prisoner and, according the Federal Official Records, also turned over the 14 most severely wounded USCT to the Acting Master of the U.S. Steamer Silver Cloud.  These were hardly acts consistent with a "massacre."  Forrest was accused of ordering the burning of Union barracks with wounded Union soldiers inside.  In the Federal Official Records Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn, Sixth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery, reported, "Lieutenant John D. Hill, Sixth U. S. Heavy Artillery, was ordered outside the fort to burn some barracks, which he, with the assistance of a citizen who accompanied him, succeeded in effecting."  Mr. Ward wrote that, "When Union Gen. William H. Bradford's soldiers, white and black, finally put up their hands, most, perhaps 400 or more, were cut down."  Lieutenant Van Horn also reported that, "There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter."  Who would know better whether or not there was a surrender - an author with no reservations about lying or a Union officer who was an eyewitness participant writing his report only days after the fact?  Since the author apparently could not find fundamental references commonly used by real historians - the Federal Official Records and the Congressional records - we must question how such a book could possibly be considered to be "meticulously researched" unless the author "meticulously researched" only those records which supported his position.  During the War 45 Black men rode with Forrest as servants, teamsters, foragers, scouts, and even as his personal armed bodyguards.  Convinced he would die in battle, the freed them in 1863 and ALL remained with him through the War and beyond.  In 1875 Forrest gave a speech in Memphis to a Black political and social group.  His speech included the following:  "We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, live in the same land, and why should we not be brothers and sisters . . . Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment . . . I thank you for the flowers, and assure you that I am with you in heart and hand."  Hardly the words of "racist mind-set" as Andrew Ward alleged.  It is clear that the "racist mind-set" is possessed by Mr. Ward, not Forrest.  It is irresponsible to promote Mr. Ward's litany of hate without questioning his motivations or methodology.  "The first law of the historian is that he shall never dare utter an untruth.  The second is that he shall suppress nothing that is true.  Moreover, there shall be no suspicion of partiality in his writing, or of malice." - Cicero (106-43 B.C.)

 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 If you are looking for information on Seichim and Reiki Healing, this is NOT the book for you.  It is, primarily, an advertisement for Mr. Ramsey's healing sessions and classes, including articles written about Mr. Ramsey in obscure newspapers and testimonials from three of his patients along with ads for his Seichim classes showing when, where and how much.  The poor grammar and lack of knowledge of the English language make the reading difficult.  Most noticable is that none of the titles of the newspaper articles are capitalized properly.  There is a very brief history of Seichim that lacks detail or substance.  There is no information concerning Seichim or Reiki healing methods or ideology.  The chakra information in the book is contradictory, placing chakras in the wrong order in one section and then the proper order on the next page.  Also the chakra colors are not consistant within the text, and they're back to being out of positional order again.  I guess confusing and misleading would be the best things I can say about this book.  I find it nervey that it is called a "handbook".  This book is a waste of money.  Sincerely, Bobbi Curtis  
 The author, having spent his military life reading about leadership, tries to write a book about leadership.  What he ended up writing was a book about reading about leadership, and given his own limited writing ability, even his writing recommendations can't be trusted.  I'm going to go read some Heinlein and see if I can't get better recommendations than this 
 This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.  If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.  The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however 
 .....I should've read the reviews before I bought it:    Unless you are pursuing a physics orquant career or some derivative of themit, not enough to interest the mainstream financial community.  As much as Derman talks about the mentality of traders or salesmen in his book, he did nothing to attract their readership with its content.  Just as I think he's developing an interesting anecdotal moment that coincides with some notable market event, Derman succeeds in finishing his thought without a big finish.   His info on Fischer Black was of interest.    
 Readers should be aware that this study was first published  in 1953, and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago.  We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled "The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950") have been thoroughly discredited.  The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision).  Even the very language is dated, with its grandiose, sweeping style, capitalization of popes, etc.  This book perpetuates a great many old myths, making the job of historians of religion just that much harder.  There are now much better books on the market 
 I just finished reading this from my local library.  As much as I love Mind over Matter and Robert Klein, this really isn't a funny book.  Maybe he didn't intend it to be, but with a title like that I thought it would be a lot more entertaining instead of blandly anecdotal.  It's really just one tale after another about women he slept with, in too much detail, or girls he fantasized about- again, too much information.  And the book ends abruptly before covering any of his success in the 70's, his political comedy, etc 
 the camera takes a long time between pictures to regenerate for the next picture. Compared to other digital camera's this has presented a problem for the two users I purchased these camera's for.   Also the flash does not adjust for the correct exposure at protraits within 3 to 5 feet. the pictures are too hot, over exposed and no adjustment works properly. 
 I TRIED to read this, because I thought it would be a light diversion along the lines of Jennifer Weiner, Lauren Weisberger and Candace Bushnell.  Shouldn't be mentioned in the same arena!!!  Disgusting would be a good word to describe this book.  I am not trying to be high brow or pretentious, I love the fun, mindless "beach read", but this is-well, I'm speachless, which if you know me is HUGE!!!  Do not bother!!!!!!! 
 I bought 20 stocks with Greenblatt's list.  Two quarters later i have lost 25 percent of my capital.  Of the 20 stocks i picked from his list, only 8 are now on his list 5 months later!!!  Wow!! What changed with his numbers SO quickly?  Watch out for the Hussler!!  You would think that Greenblatt already has enough money and wouldn't need to milk the consumer anymore with yet another book 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 Yes, it is I, the secret and very evil member of the ultra-high-level underground trilateral elite squadron of suicide Amazon reviewers here to turn you away from the truth.  For Peter Dale Scott has managed with this book to piece together what we have been trying to keep ultra-top-secret since the Middle Ages, and so now we must put out our black ops!  Man, the paranoia and narcissism in this country really shines with books like this and reviewers like these.  Face it guys, you're all just craving SOMETHING EXTRA to fend off the horror of your own inevitable death.  Seeing conspiracies is like seeing heaven -- it is a natural consequence of the human condition.  But so is rape and genocide.  So do your part to resist it 
 I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.  This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well.  You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.  I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased 
 Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.  I made two previous attempts to try to explain my point but as I started reading the other reviews I found one that explains everything I was trying to say.  One review stated the following:  I gave this 5 stars because men who rape women deserve an awful death.  Why?  When is it justifiable for a man to take revenge by killing a woman?  This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.  To defend your self is one thing but to intentionally want to kill is simply murder.  The fictional female character (not the actor) in that story should be sent to prison for life for her alone deciding to be the Judge, Jury and Executioner.  I also despise movies where the man does the same thing.  But, it is only a movie.  I gave this movie 1 star because you have to give it one.  Yet, that one review makes my point about the majority of these kind of movies.  Movies should stick more to reality when they are doing a film about something that could happen.  If this movie really is based on a true story than it is sick. 
 The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery 
 Being a huge Blondie fan, I WANT to rate this one higher, but sadly I cannot. It's just a sad mishmash of bad songs, it feel very negligant too. I love the way Blondie contributed to rap and disco, but their calypso number on this one is so awful. They had lost it here.  Check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat.. 
 There is not enough water in the world to wash away the stench of human degradation from the individuals portrayed in this book, including the author.  Don't waste your money on this drivel

 I would first like to address Nietzsche's work itself, but before I begin, I should say that I feel that I have an open mind for works like The Anti-Christ. After reading the short book however, I am amazed that Nietzsche is given more than a cursory seat in history.   The Anti-Christ is supposed to be a critique of Christianity. In effect it is a critique of Nietzsche. He rarely backs up his assertions in any way. At one point, he begins to talk about how Jews are corrupting the world, boldly assuming that it is common knowledge that Jews are inherently evil and deceitful people. Frankly, I am not interested in having someone tell me that "Jews are evil," I want them to tell me why. Nietzsche does very little of this. In fact, the main arguments that he makes for his assertions are usually based on ad hominem libel. Essentially his writing has very little substance. It's like listening to 95% of the population tell you why they didn't vote for Kerry or didn't vote for Bush (Nietzsche could have written something like that). My final complaint is that Nietzsche's depth of analysis and understanding is very shallow. It's hard to fully explain what I mean by this in a short review but if you read the book you will understand (I hope). Most of his precepts are just very juvenile and can be thought away very quickly.  In the case of the translation, I am also dissapointed. I have no problem with the fact that Mencken is just as deranged as Nietzsche (a statement akin to many of Nietzsche's), he just can't spell. This book is fraught with misspellings. In total honesty, I have never read any sort of published material that contained so many misspellings. After 20 misspellings you have to wonder about the quality of the book you are reading.  If you want to know Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ is the place to start, but I can imagine why anyone would harbor any such desires. I should also say that it is possible that I am not one of the intellectual elite or "free spirits" that Nietzsche refers to in his works. It is possible that if Nietzsche spawned right in front of me today, he might inform me that I am just one of Earth's morons. In that case, kindly ignore this review because I am an idiot 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, the photos are grainy. very grainy. However, left unmentioned was something even more troubling - many of the photos have been digitally cropped in photoshop or some such program. this was done presumably to save ink by not printing backgrounds. The cropping was done extremely poorly and amateurishly - there are toes that come to points, feet that look like blocks, all sorts of bizarre and unnatural concavities. a real hatchet job. the end result looks like someone took a pair of scissors and crudely snipped photos from a magazine. this sort of problem is particularly distressing in a book intended for artists as the accurate depiction of the outer contour of a form is vital for drawing.  On another note, the models are not actually that thin. more average. This would have been a useful book, if not for the botched photos. An older edition would likely be satisfactory. 
 Much smaller then other similar histories it is lacking in many areas. It skips many classic versions of the caped crusader in favor of a commercial promoting the current "Dark Age of Comics". It doesn't bother with many of the best and landmark portrayals such as Adam West's 60's TV series, The Superfriends, the radio and movie serials, the classic cartoons and more. There was no example of the best writers and artists, among them Adams, Aparo, Robinson and Sprang. A very abbreviated account. They could have done better and since they probably will when the new Batman movie comes out why bother to buy this book? save your money and wait until a better one is published 
 This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am.  But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, "When's he going to get to the point?"  The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary.  The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   This was the only part of the book I was interested in.  To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with "fluff".  However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise 
 I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book.  Boy was I wrong!  Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know.  And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult 
 I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally 
 The people rating this high must be paid to do so.  It's just riddled with historical inaccuracy ... Fuller's book on this topic is SO much better that I'm still kicking myself for buying this.    Just because I made the mistake doesn't mean you have to. 
 but I don't. No intaglio press. No letter press. Heck, I don't even have an old washing machine mangle to 'make-do' as a press, which was an authors' recommendation. This book is fine (as far as it goes) into prints you really can make at home i.e. by hand rubbing, but almost all of the chapters include projects that require a press. I was hoping for some innovative ways to do, say, etchings AT HOME and not have to drag my stuff to an art school and pay for press time. If you're so far along as to have invested in a real press in your own home studio, you already know everything that's in this book. If you want a book that's half what it purports to be, you might get a few ideas. Nothing is a total waste -- you might glean something from it that will improve your technique or broaden your experimentation, but don't count on it for prints you can really make AT HOME besides the usual monoprints and reliefs 
 This book offers no new insight in how to write an effective resume. The  advice given can easily be found on the internet or a book from the local  library. Most of the sample resumes just list duties and education and does  not help the reader in communicating how their skills can be beneficial to  the employer 
 I have a linksys router hooked up to a Power Line Bridge and on the other end another PLB hooked up to a PC.  It works just fine.  The problem is when I add a second PLB/PC.  Sometimes it works for a while and then the line drops and sometimes it doesn't work at all.  For some reason, the IP addressing goes off when adding a second (or third) unit.  So I am constantly resetting the router, cutting the power, disabling and enabling the PC LAN connection to manipulate them into working again.  Frankly, as you can see, it's driving me up the wall.  I'm starting to debate laying cable under my house (wireless isn't an option because I use 2.4 gig. telephones.    Like I said, with only one PC, the system is flawless 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 This dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb.  When it closes, it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side 
 this item is cheap junk i bought this item and when i got it it didn't work and after hours of fiddling with it it finally worked but the sound was terrible and when i pulled the plug out of the back after a day it said it was chargable but it wasn't it would not work without the plug attached to it and when i started to play it it kept making this annoying banjo like sound and it wouldn't stop and you can not play any fast songs on this because it   can't keep up and you can not play more than one note at a time and the keys aren't really raised it is just like pressing cell phone buttons and the plastic is so cheep it almost broke when i pressed one button and after shipping and handling the total was about $56 DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM CHEAP JUNK if you want a roll up keyboard go look somewhere else 
 Cagle's book has a wide variety of cartoons in various styles, but the book is badly hampered by Cagle's insistence that political cartoonists are primarily left-leaning (10 to 1 was the claim, which he ironically justifies by suggesting that liberals think that people are mostly "stupid" and so since that's where humor lies, there are naturally more liberals in cartooning.  He also refers to conservatives as humorless - as a stereotype, to be fair - but one that makes you wonder if the man has ever read P.J. O' Rourke, Jonah Goldberg, Rob Long, Mark Steyn, or listened to Rush Limbaugh, just to name a few.)  Cagle then goes on to pander to that assumption my placing an overwhelming number of liberal cartoonists in the pages, mildly broken up by the odd conservative cartoon.  The intros to the chapters are full of misinformation (One example is the matter of fact state ment that there's a civil war going on in Iraq...not yet, though sadly I'm sure that's wishful thinking on some leftists' part - but a country whose factions are all working towards a single government is not in civil war - there's a difference between that and a country wracked by terror.  Another: In the intro to cartoons on Hurricane Katrina, there wasn't a single mention of Governor Blanco or Mayor Nagin, an appaling omission.)  Even the chapter selections, including a section on Pat Robertson, but leaving out Howard Dean and the DNC which got a fair amount of attention from political cartoonists (and writers) this past year demonstrates a kind of calculated bias on Cagle's part.  The main problem though is that the intellectual quality of political cartooning has diminshed considerably in the past two decades.  This was already apparent when Berke Breathhead won a well-deserved award for Bloom County some years back, an award richly deserved over the polemical and often plainly didactic work of the majority of political cartoonists then and unfortunately now.  Cagle's collection is full of works that rely on the most biased, unfair, and extreme take on events, a take which will leave many readers on both left and right scratching or even shaking their heads.    However, to be fair to Cagle, this sort of simplistic bias is well rewarded by the media and the same establishment that liberals always seem to rail against, forgetting that they form a large part of it.  Anderson's Pulitzer portfolio was embarrassingly didactic and ham-fisted, and example of an award that seems to have been given out because it was one cartoonist's time.  The art of the cartoons vary and it is still nice to see some artists using brushwork and detail, even in the face of the increasingly small spaces newspapers give their artists to work with.  Ultimately though, Cagle's book is a sad reminder of the fact that the polemics of the overrated Post cartoonist Herblock  have trumped the more balanced and thoughful approach of a cartoonist like Mauldin.  That probably shouldn't be such a surprise in an age where partisan rancor is extremely high and unbearably dishonest.  To see it celebrated though is a kick in the gut to those of us who have followed and admired political cartooning for decades.  One hopes this the a deep valley from which this valuable craft shall emerge.  Right now though, that's seems a day too far off 
   Wow.  What happened?  The spirit of Helfgott swirls around the hyped-up, amateur "stylings" of cLand cLang. At least Liberace stayed in Las Vegas (Mr. cLang, there is a casino in your future.) Please, Sir, I beg of you, Listen to the masters who have gone before you!  Give some credence to the notes as they are written on the page. Since you have won the jackpot--having been christened a star irrespective of talent--at least try to stand on the shoulders of the giants whose brilliance light the world.    I suppose it takes all of one's time and energy to feed the publicity machine.  But be warned: the hypsters will soon feel the need to inflict another "star" on the world. Can you tell yet that I'm not a fan?  Lang Lang is the Paris Hilton of classical music; all style, no substance.  Apparently, fame itself was the destination and in that sense LL has certainly arrived.    
 Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 I kinda had high hopes for this one. Just cuz I was expecting a genuine good movie rather than a flick with a holographic cover I got at blockbuster for a few horror laughs. I mean, the freakin guy from the show 2gether is in it. Anyway, horrible acting and what pissed me off is the direct ripoff of HO1KC. Shes a hitchhiker, wearing about the same thing as Baby, and is talking crazy, and even says 'I love this song' and starts dancing. Anway, the plot has about one sentence 'get stuck in the ride and walk around never really searching for a way out' thats about an hour of the movie right there. Honestly nothing happens. GREAT gore though I must say. and cute little plot twist at the end. Don't buy this though, borrow from a frien 
 unfortunately this happens time and time again: mexican filmmakers hook you with an interesting premise, but then they don;t know where to go with it. The acting is good (Federico Luppi, the argeninian mel gibson as he takes a severe beating in every one of his films), but as we reach the end of the film, we are left hanging without a conclusion. Art? No; Fart. Rent it if you feel like wasting a few hours

 Shahak was a chemistry professor better known for his racist, anti-Jewish diatribes. His allegations range from the outright distorted to the flat out fictional. One example is the often used slander that the Talmud allows relations with minors. Actually, it is a sin and a crime under Jewish law. It is rape. There IS a discussion that does NOT ask whether it is allowed but whether the victim of this rape is considered a "non-virgin" when they grow up and seek to marry. In a culture where virginity is considered important for marriage, the victim may become a double victim, victimized by the rapist and again by society, being labelled a "non-virgin." The final answer is that they are considered a virgin when it comes time to get married. However, this discussion that "it is as nothing" is taken out of context as if it allowed rape. Shahak also makes many bizarre and patently false allegations such as his claim that Jews and Israelis dont' use "+" signs in addition because they are "little crosses" and that observant Jewish ritual involves desecrating Christian graves. If many readers who don't know much about Judaism find it an "eye opener," there is good reason. Shahak is making this stuff up.   If you want to know what Judaism REALLY says or Jewish Law, the Talmud really says, find out for yourself. Go to your local orthodox synagogue and ask for lessons or go to a free class. Heck, pretend you're Jewish and see what we "really" think and say. And you can also check out: http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8815/ http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/ 
 Yeah, I know I'll get shot down for the low rating, but I don't really care. The book gets glowing reviews for the most part, because most people find it touching and beautiful, and people like reading something that makes them feel all warm inside. I appreciate the feeling as much as the next person, but, really, I need more to like a book!  Really, I looked forward to buying this book, and perhaps my biggest mistake is having high expectations of it. What a lovely title: The Color of Water. And the story behind it, of McBride's mother telling him that God has no color, God is the color of water, got me all riled up and made me salivate at the prospect of sitting down and reading this book.   Basically, the book is McBride's tribute to his white, Jewish (turned Christian) mother, a woman who manages to pull herself away at a young from her abusive father and start a life of her own. She marries a black man, which is taboo, manages to raise 12 children and put them all through college. I had two problems with the book after I read it: 1. I did not care for the style of the writing because it seemed kind of loose and lacking in tension, not really very 'colorful', not as lyrical as, say, the title's promise. McBride skips around through time looking for stories about his mother, looking for opportunities to praise her. In a way, I began to feel like the tribute was not so much a tribute to his mother as an act of desperate attention from one boy struggling with having been one of 12 children, trying to get Mommy's attention. There's nothing wrong with that, though it just seems a bit obvious to me, and I felt Mr. McBride should've put more 'story' into the story, instead of just using gooey admiration and half-remembered tales as a slippery foundation to stand on. The writing did drag after a while. It's not that I need firm structure in a memoir - the beauty of memoir is, in a way, its subjectivity - but memoir is still a tale to be told, and it's a storyteller's responsibility to use SOME objectivity while writing, to give a richer tapstry. McBride did not.   His mother had 12 children, and this was worth looking into. Yes, that she raised them all by herself is admirable, BUT there's a lot more to the story...his mother's story...her religious choices, for instance: Did she turn her back on being Jewish because her father was abusive? What did she feel connected to in Christianity, what made her feel more comfortable with it? It seems like she felt more accepted within the African-American coomunity, which is fine, but then in that case god is not the color of water, because god is actually within a very specific sphere for a very lonely, very young, poor woman.  Her story interested me and I was extremely frustrated that McBride would not deliver the goods. He speaks about her horrible years with her monster of a father, but also her kind mother (whom, incidentally, she abandons altogether)and leaves so many loose ends. The praise he gives just isnt enough. What about asking her how she felt about having a (second) husband who was only around for the weekends while she was stuck with 12 kids all week? How did he feel about it? No resentment really comes out in the book. No real feeling.    2. The Color of Water did not impressive to me because I did not find the story particularly unusual. SO much hype over something so common here. There are many, many blacks and whites with mixed backgrounds in the US. Not just black and white, but many other colors here (I, for one). This country, as we know, is a melting pot. McBride talks about his family as though it were the only one like this, which leads me to believe that he was extremely sheltered, and remained that way even after growing up. He also presumes a great deal. He presumes that we all know about the racial conflicts at the time, and even if we do, it wouldn't kill him to get into it and talk about it and give specific examples, to elaborate and use the opportunity. But no.  I wasn't crazy about this book...didn't find it nearly as provacative, as diverse, as rich, as lyrical as it could have been. I suppose it would not have been considered good manners by him to delve even more into his mother's more private life, but really! The woman that is Ruth disappears behind McBride's sweet praise, and I sense her story would've been truly interesting had and her son viewed her as not just a mother, but also woman.  And McBride too. His story would've been better if he would've written as a writer as well as a son, not just a lovesick son paying his dues to Mom.  I suppose the book is ok. It's not terrible. I did not fall in love with it, though I know most people have. I'm ok with not loving it though, and can honestly say that this was one of the very few times I've ever picked up a book because of hype, and to be sure, it's the last time

 This guy is a civil rights movement [...]---making a living off of divisive, racist dialogue.  The blame for slavery depends on the perspective one takes, and how you categorize or label the wrongdoers.  i.e., was it whites that promulgated slavery, because most if not all in power at the time were white?  Or was it Democrats, since they were most strongly in favor of prolonging the institution of slavery?  Or maybe the group to be blamed should be property owners, since they wielded the most power, and stood the most to gain in the continuation of slavery.  Or perhaps we should blame the farmers as a class, since they owned the plantations, and as such, we should seek reparations from today's farmers.  Or hey, let's pin the blame on people of British descent, since the majority of settlers in America at the time were of that lineage.    In reality, the blame for transgressions against individual rights should, as always, be rightly assigned to GOVERNMENT.  If you're looking for a consistent pattern of egregious failings---one that doesn't isn't vulnerable to subjective biases---then Government is the culprit.  Alas, as Governments of old are long gone, and to levy compensatory or punitive judgments against any current government would simply be transferred to its innocent citizens, the "reparation solution" is, quite simply, a dead issue. For an interesting take on who's to blame for blacks' relative failure to compete and succeed in this country, read Thomas Sowell's "Black Rednecks and White Liberals."  It offers also a very enlightening discussion of the true scope of slavery, and the minimal impact that American slavery had, when seen in this broad context.  
 		This is a book by a chronic kicker, someone who frequently cites Emile Zola but who has all the relevance of "a young contrarian" wallowing in what is otherwise known as the terrible twos.  	Don't get me wrong:  Hitchens is very self-important, his targets range from President Clinton to Mother Teresa, which earned him an interview with Vatican authorities in a "closed room, a Bible, a tape-recorder, a Monsignor, a Deacon and a Father."  He spent years attacking Clinton, and was finally thrilled when someone noted his piffle.  But, this molehill of courage doesn't write a word in this book about President Geoge Bush.  	He says it's courageous and vital to dissent.  Nice.  Welcome to an idea that has been celebrated since John Milton and the First Amendmant to the US Constitution.  To guard his own brilliance, he doesn't cite a single example of the how, when, where, why and what of anyone he's criticized.  His book is supposed to be "the art of mentoring," but he limits it to praise of his own courage, insight, wit and relevance.  	Granted, Hitchens is a rare talent;  his unique ability is being outrageous without being effective.  He doesn't cite a single example of his dissonance doing diddly squat.  He offers feel-good whines, moans and complaints, but nothing constructive.  It's why late-night TV talk show monologues are the epitome of today's political commentary, humour, satire and relevance.  	He consistently attacks political compromise, praising "fanatics and absolutists like John Brown, who regarded compromise as a disgrace."  So  --  was Abraham Lincoln a second-rate president compared to a John Brown?  This reflects the great weakness of this book:  Hitchens doesn't understand the difference between dissent and dissonance.  	There's a good reason why Hitchens is inconsequential compared to dissent such as Zola, Vaclav Havel and even Tom Lehrer  --  this rant is always safe, tame and respectable.  It's a perfect Hallowe'en gift, a fierce rubbery face meant to produce a shriek, a laugh and a comment, "Oh, how clever!"  It's great sport for the two-year-old mentality.  	"Most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security," Hitchens writes.  This is his meagre attempt at respectability;  he does so by citing great dissenters and basking in their reflected courage, glory and relevance.  He falls far short of being a court jester, lacking the wit, wisdom, wiles and wariness to be relevant.  Sadly, but not unexpectedly, he misses the mark 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 I bought this book to try to get over a paralyzing fear that I felt about a big commitment step that I was sure, in the long term, I wanted to take. I was hoping it would provide me some insight into why I was afraid, and how to get over it. It did provide some small comfort that other men seem to have gone through the same stuff, but on the downside, the whole thing reads like a Cosmo article. It is punctuated with silly lists of things to always do or never do (which is great, because all relationships are the same, right?), it actually advises you to keep certain things secret from your potential life mate (wtf?), and if I could boil it down to one sentence, I'd say this book essentially says, "Don't worry, don't worry, it's going to be fine." Well that may be true. But I was hoping for something to help me feel better in the long term, not to give me upbeat liquid courage to accidentally make the right decision. 
 This book is very nice and all but there is only one page each for the 1st . 2nd , and 3rd birthday and there are no lines to right on in the book only on some pages. So this book wasnt worth what i payed for it 
 This book has no original ideas, says nothing positive about any subject, has no theme except "I am so smart and all others in the world are so stupid."  I kept looking for another message, or some indication about what might take us in a better direction but could find nothing.  It was discouraging to be required to select between one and five stars.... as without that requirement my rating would be "Less than Zero! 
 As a jazz flute player myself, I listen to every jazz flute recording I can find. There aren't that many. Nestor Torres is a Puerto Rican native who relocated to Miami 25 years ago after studying in New York and Boston. He's one of those guys I'd like to like, but his music just doesn't do much for me. It's not lack of technique-he has plenty. His clean tone is straight out of the classical tradition, similar to fellow conservatory-trained jazzman Hubert Laws. While I prefer a grittier sound, I can enjoy such purity if the setting is right. But Torres' material leaves me flat; the pre-programmed arrangements he surrounds himself with are mechanical and boring. It's too bad. Torres says this album was inspired by 9/11 and by a lecture given by the Dalai Lama in Florida. I wish those events had sparked a more interesting musical response.

 This book has some practical tips, but mostly it's very shallow and I don't think it addresses the real problems that come up with raising families and children 
 If you had a son or daughter take their own life, would you try to profit from it?  This is a sad sad story of a sad young man who took his own life to become closer to his delusional mother.  Wake up, Anne.  You talked all this physic nonsense and new age mumbo jumbo to your vulnerable and hurting son.  And you have the audacity to write a book in his name after he is gone?  This is not his story.  It is your sick, twisted story, told in your words.  Not his.  You are evil 
 We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.    
 Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon 
 Although the book boasts what seems as an interesting approach, it rarely lives up to the idea of cross-breeding geography with studies of the Internet. I found myself lost in endless rants on what can now be assumed to be common wisdom (i.e. explanations and definitions of the www, e-mail, usenet, etc.). Furthermore, I have found a lot of typos, which I find not only sloppy, but simply disgusting given the price of the book. Methodologically the book seems very rich, but it fails to elaborate thorougly on issues. An example of the latter would be the chapter on cyberspace, which quotes many authors being of relevance to the study of cyberspace, but how exactly is not thorougly discussed, it is merely mentioned.   On a more theoretical level, I find the authors' emphasis on spatiality intriguing, but not as relevant as they pose it is. I strongly disagree with their virtual / actual distinction, which can only clutter theoretical discussions on the implications of cyberspace on our lives. I fail to see why people still metaphysically dichotomize the so-called 'real world' with the digital world. Sure, there are differences, but who would disagree networked information technologies have an impact on us?  Just what the future of cartography / geography will be remains extremely shady and mysterious. Sad but true 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 This book is a concatenation of rather second rate conference papers covering the unbelievably hackneyed topic of Freud's oft-reported death. Honestly, what next - "killing Elvis"? If you enjoy books about the continual burying of Freud then read Crews or Masson - much better written. Wrong, but better written....of course much of what Freud wrote WAS bunk. Even psychoanalysts agree about that. But gosh, give him a break! He was the first one on the scene and his work has been revised by succesive generations of analysts (Winnicott, Klein, Bion etc). Perhaps the author might next try and do what Freud did; produce a model of the mind that explained psychopathology, many aspects of existential phenomena and creat a language of the mind that entered the every day lexicon. While Freud might be dead, his ideas (ego, projection, identification, libido etc, etc) most certainly are NOT 
 I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to 
 Like someone else said, I agree THERE ARE NO REALLY GOOD ARABIC TEXTBOOKS - (I haven't seen Elementary Modern Standard Arabic but a lot of users complained about it), incosistencies start from page one with this particular one, even with some basic lessons from other textbook I am not able to use this book on my own. I appreciate the efforts put into making this book, though (otherwise I would rate it with one star) - lots of DVD recordings, pictures but the author might want to look at how other languages are taught.  Out of all books I have attempted, I recommend Mastering Arabic (Jane Wightwick and Mahmoud Gaafar), it has some flaws but at least it's usable if you learn Arabic on your own.  May I make some recommendations?  Every text should have a vocabulary, all questions should have answers in the same book, not a separate one. Exercises based on recognising familiar words where 95% of words are unknown are a waste of time! How can you make translation exercises if most words were not introduced yet 
 Socrates would cringe that his name is in the title, and that the author attempts to draw connections to his guru self help style, and the great Greek philosopher. Do not get me wrong, the book is cute and filled with some nice cotton candy insights, but there is no way any devotee of Socrates would recognize this thinkers' profound complexity and revolutionary approach to dialogue in this writer's one dimensional philosophy and intellectulizing 
 I really wanted to like this film.  I love the biblical story and had looked forward sharing this film with my catechism class.  Unfortunately, I am not going to show it in class because it's not a good film.    The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible.  The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?).  I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed.  There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.    I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone.  This one unfortunately missed the mark 
 This is the absolute worst solutions manual ever written!  There are way too many skipped problems.  The solutions that actually are given do not help the reader to understand the material at all.  Advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 I would love to give this a review, but since I can't seem to get you to send it to me I have no idea what this book is like. Needless to say, I'm disappointed with AMAZON 
 YOU, ME AND DUPREE is a formula film, a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth, noisy, crude guy things movies.  There have been a lot of these films of late (all spinoffs of The Wedding Crasher image) and one wonders if there is a saturation point.  Relating the story is rather pointless as it is a one-line joke (?).  Dupree (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) is the best man at his buddy Matt Dillon's wedding to Kate Hudson (the You and Me) and subsequently moves in with them, causing all manner of mayhem and bad taste and faux pas and grim situations (think toilet problems etc).  And that is it.  Michael Douglas was brought in to play a flat role as Kate Hudson's father who objects to her marriage blah blah blah. Ask directors Anthony and Joe Russo for the rest.   We know that Hudson, Dillon and Douglas have much better roles to offer (Wilson seems to have found his niche), and the only reason films like this keep getting made is because they make money (for some reason) at the box office.  The film is silly, tacky, tired and should only be rented if the shelves in the video store are otherwise empty...   Grady Harp, November 06  
 Expected so much more from the winner of Man Booker Prize for Fiction 2006. Was unfortunately disappointed.  The time is late 1980's. The story is set around a growing unrest amongst the Nepalese immigrants in Kalimpong (West Bengal). There is a bitter judge who hates life and everyone around him. There is his teenage granddaughter who is such a complete bystander in life and shows such a lack of drive and spark that it is downright alarming. Then there is an illegal immigrant stuck in a series of kitchens-from-hell in NYC. There was just too much - and almost needless - negativity painted page after page. On the positive side, Kiran Desai has displayed a breathtaking mastery of the english language throughout this book. Sure, the essay-style format and lack of spoken dialogue leaves the reader feeling almost alienated from the characters, but this would be a great book from which to learn the depths of the written word. Ms. Desai has penned so beautifully at times, that the prose (if not the message) leaves a smile on your face 
 Brenda Maddox' ROSALIND FRANKLIN: THE DARK LADY OF DNA and ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND DNA by Anne Sayre both imply that Rosalind Franklin was the true discoverer of DNA and that James Watson & Francis Crick, with the help of Maurice Wilkins, stole her discovery.  Rosalind Franklin was no doubt an excellent scientist, a molecular biologist, who, along with Linus Paulding in the US, sought to solve the puzzle of DNA. She was a painstaking researcher, who compiled much of the fundamental data on the subject (in the form of x-ray photos of DNA). Her work provided the crucial information that enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA.  But the fact remains that, while she had the information, she did not make the discovery. Watson & Crick did. Could she have arrived at their conclusion give more time and more research? Perhaps. But the question is irrelevant. She didn't. They did. Watson & Crick did not "steal" her discovery. They made it on their own - no doubt with the invaluable help of her data.   But that is the way scientific discoveries are made. The great breakthroughs are always based on previous inconclusive research and data compiled by other scientists. Such information is the common property of the scientific community, not the private property of individual researchers. Progress is made through the sharing of data, studies and findings. Science progresses not in secret, but through an open system of shared information.   The credit for any scientific discovery goes to those who reach the solution first, not to those who work toward the solution or provide the data on which the solution is ultimately based.   The fact is that such discoveries are often the result of a combination of painstaking research and illuminating insight. Rosalind Franklin was a painstaking researcher. But it was Watson & Crick who had the brilliant insight.  I believe that this episode is an example of Thomas Kuhn's theory of the function of paradigms - the framework of existing concepts that dominate any field of human endeavor. The effect of paradigms is to "blind" those who work within the existing conceptual framework to possibilities that become visible to those who work "outside the box," - i.e. outside the paradigm. To work within an existing paradigm is to expect a certain solution and, inevitably, to look for that solution.   I believe that this is probably what happened with the discovery of DNA. While Rosalind Franklin was working within the framework of the existing molecular biological paradigm, Watson & Crick stepped outside the box and were able to view the data in a new and different way. This was because neither Watson (a zoologist & bacteriologist) nor Crick (a physicist turned chemist) were molecular biologists and were therefore not trapped in the existing paradigm of molecular biology. This enabled them to see what Franklin and Paulding didn't see. Therefore, it was Watson & Crick who became the discoverers of the structure of DNA and received the credit, and the Nobel Prize they fully deserved.  To give Rosalind Franklin credit for the research she did and the data she so painstakingly assembled (data which enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery) is a generous thing. But for these authors to imply that they "stole" her discovery is inaccurate. It has far less to do with the pursuit of scientific or historic truth than it does with the pursuit of a feminist agenda. 
 I reluctantly give this book one star only because it provides some interesting information. Please be aware, though, that the author veers between sense and nonsense. Some of his explanations are intriguing, such as the source of the phrase "bobe mayse." However, at times he writes as though his comments are universally accepted facts rather than his own interpretation. I was extremely upset that he presumed to speak for anyone but himself and did not clarify that he was doing so.   The most egregious example concerns his comments about "goyim." He starts by referring to a "goyishe kop" which according to him means an idiot or simpleton, rather than someone who does not necessarily think the same way a Jew might (and why should a non-Jew think like a Jew, when their experiences may be vastly different?). He then writes, "On the great chain of Yiddish being, gentiles fall somewhere between Francis the Talking Mule and Bigfoot, and goy is almost always as much as to say uneducated, uncouth,uncircumcised--". In my opinion, this  inflammatory statement marks Wex himself as decidedly uncouth, although apparently educated and perhaps circumcised. I don't know why he chose to make statements like these, but he does NOT speak for anyone but himself. In the glossary he translates "goy" as "non-Jewish man" ("goye" being the female equivalent). I was astonished that he did not provide the literal translation, which is "nation." Look up, for example, Exodus 19:5, in which God tells Moses to tell the people of Israel: "Now therefore, if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my own possession among all peoples... [6] and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The Hebrew for "nation" is "goy."   Further, in Exodus 34:10: "And he said, 'Behold, I seal a covenant. Before your entire people I will do marvels, such as have never been created in the entire world and among all the nations'..." -- the Hebrew for nations is "goyim."  So non-Jews are no more nor less than parts of goyim/nations, and Jews are part of a goy/nation called the Children of Israel. Therefore, a Jew is just as likely as a non-Jew to behave like an idiot; and since Jews have been charged by God to keep His covenant in order to be considered His people, it is perhaps less forgivable when a Jew behaves badly.   The author's comments in the next few pages about "shikses" are equally abhorrent, but I will aggravate myself no further with attempts at clarification. I hope readers understand that they should read this book with caution, if at all 
 The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds.  Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them.  Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory.  The author says repeatedly that we were "whole" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again.  Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset.  For example, in the section about "rewriting scripts" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants.  But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child 
 Just as I found her "Goddess & Angels" book dissapointing, I have also found that this one was a terrible read. Doreen Virtue titles her book with a very "welcoming" heading, and then when you actually purchase the book and read it, it turns out the title and the actual manuscript have no relation at all. Speaking as a book fan, Doreen Virtue's writing personality just doesn't do it for me.  I feel she is lost in space and has problems relating to our world, Angels are on earth to help us humans and yet Doreen has problems linking a connection to what Angels can help us with in our daily lives.  Not everyones life is a fairytale, we need real guidance, real information, we need a REAL person writing spiritual books! Having recently read a book titled "They Shine, They Fly, They're Angels" I am having problems connecting to Doreen Virtues way of writing, the authors of "They Shine, THey Fly, They're Angels" have a REAL grip to life and how we can practice spirituality in our normal daily lives, also the Author of "They Shine, They fly, They're Angels" is somewhat rare to find these days, because she is a "DOWN TO EARTH" Author, and can relate to REAL PEOPLE!  No offense to Doreen Virtue but she would really need to start writing "worthwhile" material, because as a past "fan" I'm dissapointed that society has affected her work 
 This book I felt was too strong for a younger child.  The emotions of how the child felt when she knew she wasn't "wanted" and how she rebelled.  Yes it may be true that adoptive children will do such things, but if the child is not doing so and then reads this and does it what does that tell you.  The end mellows out when everyone is happy and the child shows happiness w/the special party for adoption day signing.  In my personal opinion, this is not a book I would promote.  
 This is a black & white edition: it does NOT include the color plates of older editions.  Without color, it is impossible to appreciate the formulations of the thought-forms.  Buy an older edition instead 
 John Carradine gives a great performance but the story is hard to swallow and there's not enough of Tor Johnson.  Worth a look.  Great opening credits 
 These are sooo cheap! They grab your hair! the volume sucks as well, not very loud and some weird ringing, cheap short life peice of crap,I had to duct tape mine from falling appart, what ever you do, you must not puchase these, they suck really bad, buy Sony There much better 
 This coffeemaker's design is flawed. But my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best I've received from any company in years. They sent their new thermal carafe model, which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of. Give them a chance to make it right. Customer service is part of the equation with any purchase, and Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam has impressed me on that score 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here 
 Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device.  However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones.  We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters.  Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable.  We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else.  For a much better "quirky family" movie, wait for "The Family Stone" to come out on DVD 
 Watching the Razor release (which I bought to save a few dollars) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated. Let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times.   Fortunately I was able to find the much-praised version released by ERA of Taiwan from a seller here on Amazon, and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog-sheer perfection. 
 Warning: this book is not chrisitian but New Age and the Occult.  The author spent the last two years of her life in the blackest psychotic depression according to psychologist and priest Fr. Benedict Groeschel who is also an expert in private revelations.   Go to the EWTN website and find the article in the document library under the heading of New Age and Cults, keyword A COURSE IN MIRACLES.  Fr. Groeschel was an aquaintance of the author and gave an eulogy at her funeral.  Fr. Groeschel believes that the author's experience with the channeled "spirit" was possibly a true diabolic manifestation 
 This book tries too hard to amuse.  Annoying, trite, predictable.  Lame dialogue, poor plot development, some potentially interesting angles that never went anywhere.  I will generally read anything, but I literally threw this book in the recycle bin rather than pass it on to a friend.  I chose to read the Skymall catalog instead on my flight- it was that bad.  Waste of money.  I took all of the rest of this author's books off my wishlist and wish I had never read this one.  It sounded fun, but it was fun like BEING the bouncehouse for a pack of toddlers is fun- NOT 
 Received my camera today (05/22) and all items are not in the box.  I am missing hand strap, Ni-MH batteries, Battery charger and Cradle adapter.  Worse part is I DID RECEIVE A USB CABLE BUT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE AND DOESN'T FIT.  This is very frustrating.  How do I get the missing items 
 I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - I need to take 5 or 7 measures to be sure about the values, The diferent from the firt measures to the 7 measure is 3 degrees, I have a baby 6 months old and for me is a problem to take a lot of measure. In conclusion IS TO BIG INACCURATE.  
 Apparently this is one of those "cult" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits.   "Waiting for Guffman" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the "funniest movie ever" or "hilarious" is definitely out of the mainstream.  I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS.   OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of "not helpful" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find "Waiting for Guffman" very amusing 
 I was a little scared to buy this DVD at first because of another opera I have from the Paris Opera, Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito. The singing in "Clemenza" is stunningly beautiful, though the staging/costuming was very contemporary and a bit strange at times. Well, I got a similar thing with The Tales of Hoffmann from the Paris Opera. The singing is great, but the staging and costumes is just plain weird.  I was hoping for something traditional. I can stand productions that aren't always real traditional (like "Clemenza"), but I think they at least need to make sense. In this "Hoffmann," everything doesn't even fit together. One of the scenes I especially wanted to see was when they sing the boat song, but instead it is theatre seats moving around like waves of water with people dressed up from the 70's groping each other. I found it hard getting into the opera. The sexual scene that Olympia does was baffling, though maybe it's just not my kind of humor. I was actually surprised by it. The nudity other reviewers talk about didn't bother me that much, as she is being broken. I'm not sure I would call that nudity, as kids see that all the time with their Barbie dolls.  I would recommend this "Hoffmann" for the singing and not as your only Hoffmann. I especially would like to point out the fabulous performance by Desiree Rancatore as Olympia. I especially got this DVD because of her. I had heard her sing on DVD before (Mozart in Turkey) and loved her (her voice, stage presense, everything). It was a real treat to hear her sing Olympia and she did amazing, even right down to the robotic movements. I hope to see more of her as there doesn't seem to be much out there on her 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 I see many ridiculous comments here, such as: "ADD never existed until 1980. Now where had it been hiding for all those thousands of years?"  There are many diseases and disorders that are not discovered and/or defined for millenia.  There are also diseases/disorders that pop up for what seems to be no reason at all.  AIDs wasn't heard of before the 1970s, do you doubt its existence?  Of course not, because it is something tangible that you can have a concrete test for.  Just because ADD/ADHD has to do with the brain, and brain chemicals does not mean that it does not exist.  It is not as easy to explain and it is not as clear cut a diagnosis as many diseases, but it is nonetheless a disease.   Also, I have seen many people who say their child/children have ADD/ADHD, yet I have seen no one here who has ADD/ADHD themself.  I do have ADD/ADHD.  Ritalin and other medication I have taken for my ADD/ADHD has changed my life.  I would not be in the same place I am now if it were not for these medications and the help of a psychiatrist.  I realize medication is not for everyone, but it has a very positive, sometimes life-changing effect on others.  If you have never experience ADD/ADHD or another brain chemical disorder, you are really in no place to comment on whether other people should be taking medication or not.  This decision is up to every individual and every family, there is no perfect answer that fits everyone.  Not Ritalin, not therapy, not anything in "No More Ritalin: Treating ADHD Without Drugs. 
 I am disgusted that you would even think to ask me what my thoughts are. I emailed you with a complaint that the copy I bought was listed as new. I complained that the page edges gave the appearance they had been torn using a ruler rather than guillatined. I was very disapointed with the book and even moreso that you failed to reply to my email - I have bought a few books fom you and intended to buy more but your professionalism is so lacking that I think from now on I'll shop elsewhere.

 loved how quiet it runs, have one double the price and twice the noise! only one problem, the bottom turn table stopped within the first week!! yet the top turn table kept working. contacted amazon and they secured a return.  only problem cost $11.00 to return. seems the quality control needs improving 
 Orson Scott books, especially the Ender's series always leaves me wanting more.   I like how the Tarantino-esque approach he takes...which leads me to go back and read the other books.  
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 There is nothing new in this disappointing book.  If one had never read a book on New Age topics it is a good book but if you are looking for something new you won't find it here 
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, US Defense Contractors were also on the verge of collapse, that is until someone had the bright idea of privatizing the government. Current government privatization efforts have resulted in huge contracts costing the American taxpayer double and triple the cost of the original government employees. This book is a Conservative Pipe Dream, a guide to a fantasy bureaucracy that never existed, and a bomb that has totally disrupted the efficient operation and security of the Federal Government 
 I found this book to be very boring.  Not what I would call erotica at all.  I will not waste my money on another of the serie 
 I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:"There's a fine line between clever and stupid." This one's over the line.  "Tears of Stone" is my current fave 
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 I think this novel is best for younger readers.  I found it a little cheesy.  I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention.  
 The first season is a near-perfect translation of the events in the book. I have the first season DVD set and I didn't get anything out of the book that I didn't get out of the show. I found the book to be incredibly boring; I only read 2/3 of it 
 This book promised to be a well-researched literary biography of J. D. Salinger. I was expecting details of his literary career, including how he went about writing, his dealings with publishers, and his reaction to public and critical response to his work. I only wanted to know the personal details of his life which had a direct bearing on his writing. Mr. Alexander succeeded fairly well in this effort, which is what comprises the first half of this book.  When Mr. Salinger stopped publishing, he became a private citizen. And as such, he deserves the privacy and respect we all desire. Of course, his books (especially Catcher In The Rye) elicited immense curiosity, and there will always be those socially inept and just plain psychotic folks who won't leave it alone. But a "respected" author/journalist such as Paul Alexander should certainly know better.  However, the opening chapter "A Sighting" and the entire last half of this book are the prurient and salacious work of a tabloid hack. "A Sighting" is a very creepy first-person step-by-step account of Mr. Alexander stalking the Salinger estate, and indeed Mr. Salinger himself. He admits to passing several "No Trespassing" signs, stopping, then "...I sat in my car and looked up at his house." Then finally "...I saw a car emerge from a thicket of trees...I focused my attention on the car's driver. I saw who it was- Salinger himself." Yekkkk! I found this account of stalking an old man to be extremely insulting, disrespectful, and repulsive.  The last half of the book is even more disgusting. Mr. Alexander feels that we all need to know in nauseating detail some of the most salacious and embarassing aspects Salinger's private life which occur long after he stopped publishing. None of this tripe is the slightest bit relevant to Salinger's writings, and is deeply insulting to Salinger and his readers. Alexander has the nerve to title one of the late chapters "Stalking Salinger" and to use phrases such as "assult on Salinger's privacy" as if he is being sympathetic to Salinger. What hypocricy! Mr. Alexander has displayed the morals of a salamander. I felt like I needed to take a shower when I finished this "masterpiece".  My advice- if you want to know the relevant facts of Salinger's literary life, find another book or go on the web. There are several informative and RESPECTFUL websites out there. Please don't give Mr. Alexander your money- it will only encourage him 
 No need to write a review. Just look at the title.   Well, okay, I'll write a small review. Not only is most of it misspelled (I think it's supposed to be: "Get Crunk Who You With: The Album", but that could be open to punctuation), but even with proper grammar it doesn't make a lick of sense. That should tell you right off the bat it's "meeeyooooozzzzikkk" for morons. Who the hell takes this guy seriously anyway? Can you believe this crap is on the same charts that Led Zeppelin were on 35 years ago?!?! Scary...  Now it's time for the inevitable swarming of "Not Helpful" votes from rich wiggers and pre-teen girls. Oh, joy. Oh, pure ecstasy. Oh for the love of Norman Rockwell and the Lettermen 
 The pictures in this book are very off putting. Yuck! If I had realized what the pictures looked like I would never have bought this book 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 We need police (or something very much like them) in order to have a prosperous community that can defend itself against bandits.  Similarly, a nation has to defend its citizens from natural disasters as well as from threats to civilization from within and without.  In addition, a nation ought to try to improve its society, and that includes building roads and other public works, building hospitals and tending to the public health, doing research in medicine and many other fields, educating people, supporting arts and sciences, and much more.  That means that patriotism is not just a meaningless abstraction.    But this book does not say that.  Maybe Kateb just forgot to do that.  But maybe not.  In addition, this book mocks the fight against Middle Eastern terrorism.  I think that shows a strong stand in favor of the patriotism that the author is supposed to be skeptical of, but that patriotism seems to be only to a bunch of thugs and tyrants.  I do not recommend this book 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 This book had great potential. I don't want to give any spoilers, but the concept had all kinds of promise. Even the characters, in theory, are cool. But therein lies the problem.  Bruce Cordell, the author, is a fantastic game designer, but he was never meant to write novels. The writing in Lady on Poison is not well done, but what really makes the book nearly impossible to finish is the dialogue. Ugh! The dialogue is REALLY bad. I'm sorry, that isn't quite right. Let me try again; The dialogue is HORRIFIC. That's a little more accurate. The characters speak like a bunch of 12 year olds on a camping trip. If you don't believe me, go to your local bookstore, pick up a copy, and turn to any page, any page at all, and read some of the speech. I really can't imagine characters in such a world speaking as they did. In one instance, a man fighting for his life calls out jovially, "Think you've got me? Turns out, you're wrong." There are so many more such instances of kooky dialogue, but I won't take the time to list more.  Also, the romances just feel cheesy and childish. I just could not get into the main characters at all. They go through horde after horde of monsters and never display any kind of feeling of fear. They just sort of ho-hum their way through vile lords of darkness like we might sip a cup of coffee. In essence, the only interesting characters were the villains, and they get slaughtered so easily it's a joke.  One positive here; the prologue. It was awesome. It made me think the book was going to be excellent. I was PAINFULLY wrong. Also, the cover art is fantastic.  There are many Forgotten Realms books out there. Pass this one up. 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 When an outsider Darwinian evolutionist embraces this book as agreeing with his metaphorical spin on God's non-metaphorical Genesis 1-11, the endorsement is telling! Matter of Days mongrelizes the Lord's documentation of what He did and when/how He did it. Whatever a Darwinianist thinks of Day 4 - long or short - Genesis clearly documents that's when sun, moon and stars were MADE, not just appeared as the clouds cleared. However, bigbangers like the author can't accept that version, so have sun, moon,stars evolving over billions of years along the standard evolutionary cosmythological scenario of Carl Sagan and cohorts. Secular astrophysics dictates, defines and determines how God intended to communicate His documentary! God Himself in His Own plaintext recording of events is dismissed or subject to secular revisionism to cater to scientific rationale. How best to handle the Bible? NOT 'God said it, I believe I know what He meant and that settles my slant on it' as Darwinianism or metaphorianism choose to spin it. Rather, 'God documented it in plain Hebrew through Moses the Prophet, that settles it for those taking God at His Word unvarnished and unredefined for modern consumption, I choose to believe the Original Literal Version over the metaphorical perversion.'  That this farce would appeal to Bible-alterers,however sincere, held intellectually captive to modern science philosophism is tantamount to disendorsement for the serious Bible-accepter-at-face-value. 
 I usually try not to be too mean to a new author (as I am one, myself).  The plot was predictable, boring and simplistic.  That was not the worst part.  Now to the characters  Kattan duRhys: My God, he was weak-willed, utterly devoid of passion, he was whining on every page and annoying to no end.  I did not find him endearing at all, and skipped every line he spoke.  WHo is Kattan? "Weakling in Tights"  Melisande-- .....another simple-minded..... She's even WORSE than Kattan.  I can't imagine someone more obnoxious and totally empty of compassion and intellect than this character.    Wolfram-the only character worth rooting for, other than the dogs.  He was well-rounded, sharp, and actually knew what the heck was going on.    The pros: the songs were nice, I wish there were MORE.  After all, it was supposed to be about a BARD Hero.  Where were the songs? What happened to them whenever that annoying simpleton, Kattan opened his mouth?  I can't imagine a book where I've enjoyed less than watching six-second commericials about after shave.     
 I am about half way through the book and can't bring myself to read another page.  I only read this far hoping that soon it would become as interesting as her first book, but sadly I feel I've wasted enough time listening to the boring rants of wine, gardens, and other writers...  If you'd like to read whole chapters devoted to describing gardens and flowers and if you like to whole chapters devoted to recipes she's come across while in Tuscany, you'll enjoy this book.  The only parts I enjoyed were her travels to other parts of the country 
 Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it. What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth! If you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 Back in the 70s, the double-LP version of this UH album was as popular as "Frampton Comes Alive". However the CD version issued in the U.S. by Mercury/Universal IS NOT COMPLETE (UGH!). If you want to have the full LP edit, get the UK Castle edition, which includes among others the unforgettable "Rock'n Roll Medley".  
 The Criterion 2-disc edition is far superior in image and sound quality to this release and, most importantly, is the only one endorsed by the surviving creators.  You can receive thoughtful and in-depth information on the film with that release, something Mike Nelson's comedic commentary could never provide.  Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized 
 Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, "this is idiotic", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.  It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.  But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right? 
 i  own this bag in a blue color,it seemed nice.but after 4 months the strapp is starting to tear off the bag.now im shopping for a replacment 
 I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust.  I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me.  They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself.  I only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so I can't complain.  At least My 3 month old likes to look at it.  I would not recommend buying this toy 
 Your Steam Fast will rest EXACTLY 2 ft 3 inches from the ground. This stand cannot change height so it is meant to be used while sitting.  I don't iron that many shirts/clothes at one time so sitting is not necessary, and standing at 5 foot 8 inches and trying to use the steam fast at 2 ft 3 inches can be challenging.  After I steam, i have to get up multiple times to hang the shirts. I don't know why they don't design a stand the raises the steamer to standing height.  Crazy!  Just know what you're getting and you won't be disappointed.   
 Here began the death of all substantial poets 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 As I have an interest in studying various sects, and had not yet spent much time learning about Rastafarianism, I bought this book for an introduction to that faith.  I will say that there is much valuable content in it regarding the history of Jamaica and Jamaican slavery and the beliefs and rituals of various Rastafarian groups, and even an interesting though slim aside on the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  On the other hand, the writing is amateurish and repetitive.  Perhaps each chapter began life initially as an individual paper and Barrett later compiled separate papers into his book, without removing repetitive, overlapping information.  However, this does not explain the overall fair, and sometimes poor, quality of the writing in general.  Additionally, while often bending over backward to apologize for questionable aspects of Rastafarian history, he seems to treat other religious traditions on the island with an attitude of judgmental disdain.  Though I learned a good deal of history, I did not feel that I was reading a scholarly work 
 This one looks like a good idea and the film is pretty to watch but the story is bloody and confusing. I had no idea what was going on and after about 30 mins I really didn't care. It was a blood bath in a horrible future city that had no point at all. The CGI was cheap looking but mixing it with live actors was a nice touch. If the plot were better it would be a film worth watching 
 This book might be good as a simple review for children interested in kennels.  I found it to be very simplistic and filled with a lot of "common sense" information.  If you are really interested in  reading it, check your local library, it is just not worth the money 
 Sometime during the 1960's, William F. Buckley sardonically observed that it was disgraceful the way that this country makes the Kennedys fight for the throne.  In 2003, Buckley offered an interesting 40 year past retrospective on the Kennedy presidency - its legacy was entirely personal.  Kennedy accomplished nothing that was singular and enduring in effect and in fact had his share of NEGATIVE accomplishments.  He is venerated today only because of his physical beauty.  Buckley might have been anticipating this book, but he never would have had the heart to say or even to think to question the utility of women's suffrage in a television age - let alone to recognize the danger that it poses.  This book by Gretchen Rubin (how can you doubt a name like this?  Are parents still naming their kids "Gretchen"?) might inadvertently highlight that danger.  It makes a half-hearted attempt to be an objective analysis of the Kennedy presidency and of Kennedy as a human being, and I'll even give the authoress a modicum of credit for rejecting conspiratorial explanations for the homicide.  But in the end, this book reads like a cross between one of those shallow post-Camelot soft-soaping kiddie books (anyone remember "Meet John F. Kennedy" by Nancy Bean White?) and a diary that might have been written by a circa-1959 bobby soxer screeching at the top of her lungs while watching JFK emerge half-naked from the ocean and onto the beach.  After giving her readers various perspectives on JFK, the authoress, Gretchen Rubin, - who claims to be a historian - weighs in with her own opinion that JFK really was a great president.  Why?  Uh - because he was so dreamy.  William F. Buckley really IS a genius!  You had to give them the vote.  Truth to tell though, public fascination with JFK is its infatuation with personal charm and physical appeal to the complete exclusion of substance and character.  And it represents a failing of democracy as a whole, not just of women's suffrage.  The GW Bush presidency, though, might help historians more savvy than Ms. Rubin get a better handle on the JFK presidency.  The GW Bush presidency might actually be a matching Republican book-end to the Kennedy presidency.  Both the GW Bush and Kennedy White Houses were Tinker Toys bought for a spoiled brat to play with.  Both individuals came to power with a pachydermous skin and a hubris stemming from dynastic ambitions.  Both presidents led this country into tragic military conflict.  More parallels could undoubtedly be found, but the point is that after the ashes of the Bush presidency have been swept away, some people might actually notice these parallels and rethink the Kennedy presidency - and maybe even recognize the dangers inherent in a president assuming office under the rationale of the divine right of kings 
 Half of this book is just Tom reading events from a high school history book. I expected the book to contain 90% letters but was disappointed half of the book contained this unwanted history review. It seems Tom is just trying to capitalize on the generation's tragedy. His reading of the factual events adds almost nothing to the understanding of the letters 
 To call this book a Marxist rant would be an understatement.  Davis spends over 400 pages verbally demolishing a great city.  I've lived here my entire life and I could not imagine living anywhere else.  Nothing escapes his wrath.  He engages in the same tiring class warfare arguments all Marxists value; Rich against poor, black and latino against white, religion against secularization.  Everyone who has a position of power in Los Angeles is raked across the coals.  Never mind that he does not provide any of his own solutions for the supposed problems of our city.  If you are looking for a balanced well-argued book do not look here, but if you are looking to read a leftest diatribe you'll feel perfectly at home 
 I've been a huge fan of Dylan, Tom Waits, Bruce Cockburn and many other 'offbeat' artists for years.  I hear that this was a great album, one of the first to break the genre of industrial experimentation and that it was a must listen; rated highly by Rolling Stone.  All I can say is I must be turning into my dad, because 95 percent of it just sounded like random noise with little rythm and NO rhyme for the lyrics to eventually lead back to.  I got most of the way through it in the first sitting. Several days later I tried to give it another chance but frankly it was just too annoying to overcome 
 Two weeks ago I saw these onions out behind the Denny's on 81st. They were speaking perfect English. Not a hint of a Spanish accent. Then just yesterday I was at a rendition of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and I saw one of them pretending to be German. It's all a SHAM!!! These are simple American onions trying to be pretentious and pass themselves off as something exotic. Don't believe the hype 
 I had read other reviews regarding the keys getting stuck.  I bought for Christmas anyway, and my four-year-old son loved it.  The keys threatened to stick on many occasions, and the instrument finally broke on March 7.   Six of the seven keys on one side only blow air.  I'm not sure what to do because he wants another one 
 I'm VERY picky about my linguistics books because I've just read too many by hobbyists that turn out to be full of errors.  Unfortunately being an actual linguist doesn't stop the author of this book making sweeping statements that simply aren't factual, or rubbishing statistics because he has a "feeling" that the opposite is true.   He predicts that English will be the only language spoken anywhere in the world in the not-so-distant future, and on what basis? His main "evidence" for this seems to be the fact that Quebec French is adopting English forms of speech.  Absolutely nothing is put forward to justify the conclusion that English will replace French in France, though, or Spanish or Arabic or Chinese in the countries where those languages are spoken.  Yet somehow he arrives at that conclusion anyway.  Dalby also makes shockingly racist comments about the Travelling community in England, and for all his dire warnings about the deaths of languages, offers no practical solutions whatsoever for how to prevent them - except that people should stop spreading English.   An easy enough read for those of us interested in the subject, but unfortunately contributes very little of substance to it 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 I bought this toaster oven because it had a convection oven.  I have not toasted anything yet but I did make a small roast beef which took as long to cook it as it would if I had used my regular oven and the bottom burnt also. I only used it on the lowest degree and had to guess on how long to cook it.  The instructions do not give you any help with deciding how long and what temperature to use, so you just have to guess. I emailed Oster Customer Service to ask how long to cook things or if they had a some other instructions that might be of help, they got back to me and said "use the temperature that you would normally use to cook the item and cut the cooking time in half" that was not much of a help. I will not buy anything else made by Oster because of the trouble I had with another toaster oven made by them. This one looked good and the inside was large so I thought I would give it a try, I guess that was a bad idea.  I will be returning the oven to Amazon and I have no idea what brand to buy next 
 This toy seems unfinished and cheaply made.  I got it for $15 at Toys R Us and I certainly wouldn't pay more for it.  It is small, doesn't have an on/off switch, and the characters barely look like themselves.  It definitely doesn't look like it will last long, just not well made.  BUT...my 15 month old daughter loves it.  My 3 and 6 year old boys got bored with it really quick but it does keep my daughter's interest.  She loves the wiggles.  The characters pop up and down when you play they keyboard and it is easy for the little guys to play with it.  I hate toys marketed to little kids and it is too hard for them to manipulate it to make it work.  The music quality isn't too bad and it does have two different volumes.  Not that annoying for the adults.  The music only plays for a couple seconds at a time.    Not a bad toy but they could have done so much better.  
 If you're buying this book for yourself, spare yourself the headache.  It is certainly not of any academic value, and considering what I've read so far, it does even appear to be a business law book.  The book chronicles very simple and basic legal matters, and presents these topics in such a way, someone interested in a thorough discussion of them would likely become upset.  As I said before, unless you have a very basic interest in law, ignore this book as much as you can.  Also, because the book is not state-specific, there's not much you can get out of the book.  It presents general information, which is of no use to those who want to learn specifics.  I've given it two stars just because it would probably be good for a beginner 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 I was sorry I purchased "Projects in Less Time" and felt a little cheated. Maybe I read the title and description wrong. About 15 minutes after I received it I realized the title and summary of what the book "promised" to tell me didn't match the contents that much. Being the book is relatively inexpensive it was not worth the time and trouble to send it back. I see this book has gotten a lot of high ratings ("5") here at Amazon. That doesn't seem right to me because the book is about "Projects" yet lacks usefulness and content from a Project Management (PM) point of view.  The final let-down in this book for me was that the main case study/example toward the end of the book was about a production constraint example--not a CCPM example. Here's where I'm coming from: I am both an experienced practicing project manager and a project management instructor. I recently "discovered" books on Theory of Constrains (TOC) and Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) over the last year. I have also purchased and learned several CCPM scheduling software packages. I am not saying "don't buy this book". If you are looking for a "brief" on Theory Of Constraints (TOC) using Goldratt's production examples and don't want to read Goldratt's books, which some folks don't like because they are long novels, then this book might be great for you. For someone looking to learn more about CCPM--it may not be for you. If you are like me, I would start with The Goal, the read some other Goldratt books. Then for more technical how-to in order to implement CCPM I'd look to Lawrence Leach's books.  I spent an hour writing this to help prevent others from wasting their time and money if they got it wrong--like me. I hope my comments can be helpful to some, either way. 
 Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well.   It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking?  At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet.  There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money.   There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business.   Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that.  Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new 
 I have read and subscribed to Organic Gardening (and Farming)since mid-70's but dropped my subscription in and around 2000. I pick up an issue now and then in newstands, just to "check in" and hope for a return to the "good ole days". The publication used to be superior (find old issues in a library to see the what I mean - especially the 70's) and gave tons of information to all levels of gardeners (some issues used to have 100's of pages, almost all text - though in a smaller format). I still have old copies and to this day find inspiration in those articles. Now its just LARGE glossy pictures, sparse writing, reduced page counts, basic gardening info/lists and more than a dose of Maria Rodale's opinion/politics. I guess their surveys/advertisers tell them this is what "organic" gardeners want...but I would bet Robert Rodale (who edited the mag back in 70's and early 80's) would be upset to see how his daughter has screwed up the magazine. Save your subscription and read the old ones at a library. Yeah...the varieties will be out of date (that's what a seed catalog is good for and/or seedsavers.org) but the info is pure "organic gardening" 
 Most of the items in this book were not specifically focused on deals for seniors. I got the feeling that the same contents could have several different covers and be marketed to other niches. In addition, so many of the free things were "free catalogs" or "free recipes"...anyone can get that information off of the Internet without buying a book 
 While the book is not bad, the authors will give you the irritating feeling that they have milked this cow for all it is worth. Where does it end? Chicken Soup for the Soup Lover's Soul? Chicken Soup for the Mountain Climbers Soul? Chicken Soup for the Amazon Reviewer's Soul???  Where there is a buck to be made on inspiration, the authors of the "Chicken Soup" series will sniff it out 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 The only discipline lacking in this story, is the author's 
 Written in the style of a Bulwar Litton Contest winner with the grammatical knowlege of a five year old! No, Mr. Tremayne, between you and I, is not correct english.  The passive voice may add a few words(never use one word, if two or three will do)and pad your wallet and the flimsy plot but it does nothing for the reader.  History C-, Style and Grammar F 
  After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away. But this c d is directed at mothers with girls still living at home. How to raise them so they have self pride, integrity and can handle finances. Only the first tape talked about mothers and daughters over 35. It was a waste of my money. 
 I really don't know why everyone is giving this book five stars.  I purchased this book based on the recommendations I saw here, despite the fact it is a year older than the latest Lonely Planet.  I do have the Lonely Planet guide that Jens Peters wrote from years ago, so I figured I'd go with his latest.  I was wrong.  I found his suggestions and assessments incomplete compared to the recent LP and the book is peppered with advertisements, which make me question whether or not these ads influence his writing.  I have returned this book and purchased the latest LP Philippines.  I'm very happy with my decision.  With a dearth of updated Philippines travel guides in the first place, I'd go with LP... at least until Moon Guides update their version! 
 This book was one of the worst books I have ever read.  The characters are lifeless and the plot is unrealistic.  Without giving away too much of the book, lets just say the author does not have a firm understanding of ballistics or basic law enforcement procedures 
 I was disappointed by this book.  While generally sympathetic to its conclusions, I was expecting a systematic examination of exactly what the title purported to promise, namely, "How the American Media Sell Wars..."  Instead what I got was a broad hodge-podge of sweeping statements that oftentimes read like a blog post -- of over two hundred pages.  The authors seem to realize this when at the conclusion of the critical 2nd Chapter titled "The Crisis in Journalism", they write:  "We concede that this has been a sweeping discussion of journalism, and we have had to use broad brush strokes.  We believe our core argument survives more detailed examination, and it would certainly be qualified and enriched by more detail and nuance." (p.35)  This level of examination doesn't stop them in the very next chapter from "drawing upon the foundation laid in chapter 2" as if sweeping assertions in one chapter could support sweeping assertions in the next without ever having to come back down to planet earth to have a closer look.  The book is completely riddled with un-sourced and undocumented conclusions which you either agree with or not but which the authors simply announce without bothering to prove.  The situation in newsrooms "is not unlike the newsroom in Pravda or Tass in the old Soviet Union" (p.32).  Media coverage of Colin Powell's speech at the UN "could not have been exceeded by Stalin's stooges" (p.59).  While all of this sounds great, you're entitled to wonder in a book that places so much emphasis on journalistic standards what exactly the authors know about Pravda, Tass or "Stalin's stooges".  In sum, this isn't a book that's particularly strong from a journalistic or research standpoint.  The conclusions might make you happy but you're none the wiser as to the reasons why.  The fact that magazines like The Nation, In These Times or Mother Jones haven't reviewed it also isn't a good sign.  My copy is going straight into the trash 
 I use to Love Maxtor. Still Have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers. Well, The darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone. I did have a lot of it backed up but still, what a pain. Now that Seagate owns them, spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive. OR get a couple of these and RAID them. but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping 
 There is one voice in this book and every character uses it in exactly the same pedantic, stilted manner.  (At a dinner party, with the alcohol flowing freely, the husband finally lets his real feelings rip: "Joan might wax poetic about the Cape's bucolic nature, and this place may have filled the soul of Thoreau, but I'm not sure what it's going to do for me".) Each tiny situation is analyzed to death within the narrow prism of Anderson's self-centered nature.  Considering her broken ankle: "It is no coincidence that the left side of my body sustained the injury, as it is the left side that is thought to be the feminine side - the side that receives and surrenders.  In the healing of my ankle, am I also meant to allow my softer energies to flow more freely"?  Geez.  Joan needs to get out and do some volunteer work 
 While it looks like a great toy, this never installed on my XP home system.  After 3 hours with Logictech support (that is phone time, not the many hours of waiting time!) and many attempts at setting privledges in the Registry, it still never installed.  Logitech blames Microsoft, and it may well be true, but they should have a manual way of starting services instead of relying on automation.  I am very disappointed that I never got a chance to even try the pen.  If you do take the chance on it, be prepared to ship it back because it may never even install on your system.  
 This is the worst book I've ever read on racing tactics. If you're a beginner racer, you can develop an understanding of the entire contents of this book just by doing a few road bike races. While I was reading this book, I was really surprised to read that the author has never experienced a cross wind on his bike while training or racing. Apparently he never raced in northern California.  
 The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect.  They are HORRIBLE!  Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card.  When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money.  Bad, Bad Servic 
 This is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution China.  The 5 people live relatively miserable lives, touched by official corruption and incompetence (with the exception of one who benefits handsomely).  China is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality, with widespread corruption, and widespread incompetence.  This view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years.  This book is an interesting read as gossip often can be, but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day China 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 This tape really doesn't show you how to do all of the cuts listed.  In fact, you don't ever see a complete groom from start to finish and all of the dogs are show dogs who stand perfectly still without the use of a grooming tether.  The tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools; she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on.  I was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a "show" with occasional comments tossed out.  The groomer almost seemed bored with her job!  I purchased it so that our novice volunteers could learn about grooming but I don't see how it will help educate them.  We'll probably never use it 
 If time didn't exist, or more specifically motion, then I wouldn't die after putting a bullet into my head after trying to get through this boring, boring book, right 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 I would think twice before ordering this edition.  It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books.  Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type.  I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet). One advantage of reading online is the easy ability to look up vocabulary.   For the price, it's simply not worth it 
 i liken this book to fitzgerald's "tender is the night." and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad 
  The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite.   I do not recommend this book.    
 Much to my chagrin, I have discovered that the book cover does not match the one that Amazon advertised, but two things bother me immensely:  1)  I noticed that the book came from India and that the ISBN # for this book does not match the ISBN # I had ordered.  2.) It is a first Indian reprint, 2006 and states: "This edition is manufactured in India and is authorized for sale only in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.  This has left me to wonder if the content in this book even matches the content of the book that I need for my course which starts in three weeks.  Where is the quality control 
 I hate it when I have to skip pages to enjoy a book.  Page after page after page after page after page after page of needless details that don't further the plot.  Baxter got so bogged down in details about spaceflight and PREPARATION for spaceflight that he forgot he was telling a story.  Hey, we're smarter than that.  We get it 
 It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe.  I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle.  Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 As an installer by trade, I urge anyone interested in learning the construction of stairs to consult another book.  I wish I had read the other readers comments before I wasted my money on this book 
 This was a total waste of my money.  If you plan on compiling the code then dont purchase this book.  It will not compile and they have known it for a while.  But refuse to release a code update.  If you dont believe this visit the Apress website.  They know the code is bad 
 After the nu-metal ship sunk, Dez got rid of Coal Chamber (another terrible band) and started this awful band to keep the paychecks flowing.  In doing this, he's making us think he's a death/black metal fan, but I know that he's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill trend-hopper.  Now to the music, it's lame, watered-down "metal" made for the kids who listen to Trivium, Slipknot, and Korn.  Listen to Kreator's "Enemy of God" for a WAY better metal album from 2005 
 Fiona my son has had this book for a little over a year now.  He currently is 27 months and HE KNOWS that the smoke stack, exhaust stack is NOT a funnel.  He may know that because we farm and he knows almost every part of a tractor, but for future printed illustrations, you may want to think about changing that word.  A funnel is used for adding oil and liquids etc...  I'm sorry this may be petty, but I have wanted to bring it to your attention for quite some time.  Otherwise a very good, cute book that is Great for sensory issues 
 The mysterious sacred secret 5 Tibetan rites can be freely found illustrated with complete instructions on many websites.  I suggest you try them for a month and if you're still doing them at the end of that time, and wish to learn more consider buying this book.  Start with 3-5 repetitions of each, and add 2 reps per week up to the maximum of 21.  Or alternatively, do 20 minutes of yoga or pilates or aerobics or rebounding or weight training each morniing and you will probably get the same or better results 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I really wanted to like these, but they just won't stay put.  It's not a thong, but it will be after a few hours of wear.  I usually love DKNY products, so I am disappointed 
 Gad!  Such a looooooong book!  This would better be called "A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World" since most of the places visited were European.  Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food.  I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now.  I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.  Traffic bad in Portugal?  Look at San Francisco!  Beggars in Naples?  Just look at San Francisco!  No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective.  
 After reading reviews I had imagiend this book to be a master piece.  After received I was simply not impressed.  Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding.  A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion.  None were that breath-taking.  You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi 
 You would think that you would buy and watch these seasons, but you just never put them in the DVD player.  What a waste of money 
 I am an animal lover and owner of three dogs. I also practice alternative medecine and my dogs are in my office with me. I received this book for my birthday and do not know what to say to the woman who gave it to me.   I found it boring, repetitive and full of "aren't I wonderful" stories about the poor author struggling through vet school, tortuing animals and gee whiz not liking it, then, golly, figuring he was going to darn well do something about it.  OK, he went to acupuncture school before a lot of others, but he is so pro acupuncture I find it tedious.  He mentions other alternative therapies only briefly, and I could tell he was not well versed in them.  He goes on and on ad infinitum about how other methods "work well in conjuntion with regular veterinary care".  Well, isn't that rocket science?  A poorly written, egocentric story about a vet and his "magic dog".  Give me a break 
 The Rebel-With-A-Heart-of-Gold-Who-Learns-The-Meaning-Of-Love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures, which were very popular in the movies and on TV at that time. The "European" setting got  Elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction  were basic, to say the least, and the music was uninspired and badly mixed  on record. The movie does have one of Presley's best set of opening  productiom numbers: "Long Legged Girl.." and others are rousing  tunes delivered with that Presley panache often missing from his late-'60s  efforts. But about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan  reaches for a magazine. An interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a  true "discovery" - an English teenager making her screen debut  with Elvis Presley! She handles the light-hearted assignment very well  indeed - even the "Old MacDonald" sequence which usually is  reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack  album cut 
  Throughout the ages, most humans have considered their religious worldview the one true Way.  This has led to three different modes of thinking: Those who believe that the truest way is to serve all gods and include all religious thoughts, those who believe only one god -their own- should be served, and those who thought all religions too confusing, contradictory or fraught with error to be a reliable guide to understanding the world.  Frances Sheridan Goulart's "God Has No Religion: Blending Traditions for Prayer," falls securely in the first category. This is the way of Hinduism and those who are inclined to mixing religious traditions without regard to the moorings of those traditions will certainly like this book. This volume tackles an important but sensitive question: How to pray, what to pray, and how to pray in a way that is real and satisfying to the individual, and how to  apply those practices one values from another tradition. "God has no religion" builds on such books as the Oxford Book of Prayer by containing traditional and modern prayers from other traditions, but Goulart goes further in that she does not make Christianity the primary focus of her collection, and she crafts exercises to challenge participants to step out of their own spiritual tradition. After three introductory chapters which deal with prayer practices, she gets down to the core of the book which are a collection of prayers. Each prayer comes from a specific tradition and is accompanied by a brief Origin note and Options which aid the seeker to flex spiritual muscles. Often the prayers contain italicized sections which the author suggests can be changed to another tradition or removed.   The book's intention seems to be to help the religious seeker better capture the infinite varieties of human worship.   In the first chapter, "Prayers and Praying in the Twenty-first Century" Goulart states, "twenty-first century seekers revere the past but aren't held hostage by it. Almost half of all Americans under thirty, and one-third of those over seventy, think the best religion is one that borrows from all religions." Such statements will make the analytical reader suspicious. Goulart deftly manages not to name the study. Furthermore, while only one sentence specifies "Americans," that specification is so closely linked to "twenty-first century seekers" that a subtle mismanagement of statistics becomes immediately apparent. Although evangelical Christianity and fundamentalist Islam are rising in many non-western culture, it is clear that to Goulart only American societal development that matters. Americans who can distance themselves from the American tendency to believe that "where America goes, the world follows" will be offended at Goulart's apparent western solipsism. Later when Goulart's imprecise writing melds with the American solipsism, we encounter this "Holier-than-thou" spiritual comparison:  "21 percent of us think we are more spiritual than our elders." Presumably a book about spiritual diversity should avoid spiritual comparisons. By the time I finished the preface, and read Goulart's definition of "Blessed be" as "A Feminist way of blessing what has passed and what's to come" I had grown so wary about the author's, imprecise writing, lack of directness, and casually-tossed off statistics that only advertising executives, journalists, fact-checkers, and teachers reading term papers would understand my annoyance. Certainly, it would have been more honest to state that "Blessed Be" is of wiccan or neo-pagan origin. I found myself researching almost every prayer or commentary in Goulart's book. Never had I dreamed I would thumb through Vine's Expository Dictionary, the Book of Common Prayer, Greek Dictionaries, and the Oxford Book of Prayer while reviewing a book.   Goulart abridges several prayers and gives adaptations of others. Comparing the wording of prayers in God Has No Religion with the same prayers in the primary sources, I noticed that Goulart made some interesting changes. For instance, Goulart's version of one prayer --"For Today" reads thusly: "O God: Give me strength to live another day; Let me not turn coward before its difficulties." But in the Book of Common prayer, it actually reads: "O God: Give me strength to live another day; Let me not turn coward before its difficulties or prove recreant to its duties." It's a small change but a telling one.   In the Options section of each page, Goulart gives the reader the opportunity to pick and choose what aspect of a certain prayer to remove. It is probably understandable to many seekers that Goulart should "adapt" The Lorica of St Patrick - a prayer soaked in Christian symbols- but her adaptation so frees the prayer from its moorings that the reader wonders if perhaps Goulart hasn't gone too far. There is so much heavy-duty tampering that her "abridgment" of the Lorica that St Patrick seems more of a worshiper of Gaia than a Christian. And the fact that she doesn't acknowledge that the portion of the prayer she chose is so unlike the major heart of the prayer, makes the reader cringe. Here was censorship by misdirection. Oftentimes, the abridgement and adaptations not only gut the traditional heart of a prayer but they soft-soap the worshipers' duty towards the Supreme Being. For instance, when Goulart abridges Michelle Balek's interreligious prayer "A Prayer For Global Restoration," the hard-hitting aspect of the prayer is removed. Certainly a modern interreligious prayer is already so inclusive, Goulart doesn't need to further strip it.   The author's choice of modern prayers can also be suspect. In describing the origin of a prayer entitled Heart of Compassion, Goulart writes "This prayer is inspired by the belief that Jesus' position as a son of Mary rather than of Joseph in Jewish Palestine suggest that Jesus was perceived as illegitimate and suffered with Mary the rejection of society. His compassion for women and children may have stemmed from this experience." Even if we ignore the Biblical fact that neither enemies nor apostles ever hinted that Jesus was illegitimate (quite the contrary- the people in his hometown called him The Carpenter's Son) the scrutinizing reader is left wondering what exactly does Goulart mean by "the belief" ? Whose belief? The belief of the people in Mary's day? The belief of the one who wrote the modern prayer? And how are we to understand the phrases, "The belief suggests" or "may have stemmed"  Suggests to who?   Another moment of suspicion arises in the Origin section of "Forgive Us Our Debts," where Goulart writes "A translation from the original Aramaic by Neil Douglas-Klotz" of the line "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" from the Our Father. What was translated from the Greek as debts or offenses can actually be understood as "hidden past" "secret debt" and `inner fruit.'" While I'm open to finding the therapeutic in the Lord's Prayer, Douglas-Klotz' mistranslation of a word which means "a debt owed but unpaid" as "secret debt" is clearly at odds with the meaning found in every Greek Bible dictionary. It's not that Goulart has considered a modern prayer as traditional, it's that she often bypasses those aspects of a prayer she considers inconvenient and often uses the idiosyncratic beliefs of untraditional clerics and contributors.   The organization of the materials, and the resources will make this book much loved by the uncynical searcher, but those who understand that we live in an age of generalized truthiness, an age of almost-true memoirs, and scripted reality shows will find themselves like the Berean synagogue searching the Scriptures to see if those things are so. The prayers listed in the book do indeed have a form of godliness and are of the sort the comfortable healthy westerner would admire: but they do not speak to those who live oppressed by sickness, poverty, disease, sin. One wishes Goulart had had the moral courage to not use words so slickly and to leave the many prayers as she found them. Why hide the origin of "Blessed Be" for instance? In her attempt to market the idea of blending traditions together, she has created a collection which is not only clearly suspect but a book of prayers spoken to a vague, undemanding, filtered and stripped-down God.   Not recommended.   
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 Although Roizen and Oz have a great premise here for loosing weight what they have to present gets lost in the presentation.  The book is full of idiotic quips that are redundant, serve no purpose to the book, are a distraction to the overall message of the book and at times were rather degrading.  While the quips are at first funny, 30 pages into the book it gets to be rather tiredsome.  And the diagrams and cartoons in the book didn't add to it at all.  The diagrams belonged more in an elementary school science book than in a book whose target audience is suppose to be adults.  The cartoons, like the quips, just got tiresome.  I was inspired to go out and buy this book after seeing the YOU ON A DIET show on TV.  I honestly thought the docs had something useful here.  Unfortunately I was only able to make it half way through this book before having my "fill" of it.  As the diet was in the last part of the book I didn't quite make it that far and at this point I just don't have the stomach to open this book again.    As I mentioned before I do believe that Roizen and Oz have a good premise here however I just found this book to be too full of silly foolishness to be taken seriously as a diet book.  I am glad to see that it has worked for others, I just wish these two had presented their material better as I was totally ready to give their ideas a SERIOUS try - unfortunately I just don't think they were serious enough about their ideas for me to try them.  I don't recommend this book to any serious dieter.  If you want serious motivation, a common sense plan and someone who will talk to you like the adult you are then I suggest any of Bob Green's books - a very enjoyable read from which I gained enough motivation to lose 50 pounds!!  Having reached a plateau that I am having a difficult time breaking I thought something new and different might be worth a shot.  You On A Diet was definitely not new or different, it was boring and degrading 
 I purchased this and am not impressed.  Note that "works with all click wheel iPods" isn't true.  It does NOT work with photo iPods (at least the 60 GB model). I'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit.  I'm ordering a 'photo dock' since I can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60GB/photo model.  If I'd known this, I'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately, since I already have a charger (came with it...).  Grr.  :- 
 How can you know that you are really, really famous? One strong hint would be that people are willing--even happy--to pay good money for a reprint of your old emails. On that criterion, and based on the cheerful other reviews, Larry Niven is really, really famous.  Don't get me wrong; on my shelves are 22 books with Niven's name on the spine. But this one is a shoddy collection of castoffs, cobbled together not (I hope) by Niven himself, but by some marketing droid desperate to have some more Niven "product" to sell. It contains four actual stories totalling 100pp; the rest is trivial filler, including the above-mentioned printout of emails.  Those might be of interest to a PhD candidate in English writing a thesis on"Collaborative Methods In Science Fiction of the 1990s" -- but they are really for the wanna-be SF writer who wants to fantasize that he or she is among the lucky handful who actually get to collaborate with Larry Niven. In fact the emails are no more interesting than email between you and your co-workers. There's no writerly advice from Larry to his pals, no "here's the golden secret of good plotting." You could read a megabyte of such email and be not one adverb closer to publication of your work.  The rest of the trivia includes brief, uninteresting excerpts from novels; old, short, and dated essays; a report on a trip to an SF Con; a brief intro to someone else's book; and fragments of the "canon" (i.e. notes) on the milieu of the Man-Kzin Wars.  This stuff is just sweepings from the writer's office floor. They show you nothing of Niven's imagination or plotting skills. Their content would have near-zero interest but for the fact that they were not swept up from your office floor, but from Larry Niven's.  The editing is shoddy as well. There's no publication information at all (no citations for published items, no dates for unpublished ones). There's just no way to tell what has been published before, nor where. For example, half of the 100pp of actual fiction is a story, "Procrustes," but there's no hint that it was previously published as part of Crashlander (Ballantine, 1994). The lack of this data makes the book irritating to read (ok, when WAS this Intercon he reports on?), and useless as scholarly source material.  This book is for the library of an obsessive Niven completist collector. Ordinary readers will do well to save their $7 
 We ordered an 8 inch quiche pan.  When it arrived, the Nordic 8 inch pan turned out to be 9 inches.  A 9 inch quiche pan can be bought at any local store.  I went on line to find a hard-to-locate item.  AND when I ordered this item it was not in stock so I waited almost a month for delivery and it is NOT AS DESCRIBED  I was deceived by the web advertisement.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon hides the merchants name in the billing arrangement so I cannot review the merchant 
 This woman can't sing, she can't dance, she can't act (except in impromptu s*e**x videos). I don't even know if she can TALK. But there's one thing she's definitely mastered and that's standing around looking like a bimbo. Steer clear if you value your ears 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 I have to ask myself what is wrong with the title of this "Disney Treasure"? Oh I see  what the problem is its called the COMPLETE Pluto! its not even finished. 'On Ice' and 'Beach Picnic' were Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons and pluto starred in 48 cartoons and this set consists of 23 
 If your looking for an autobiography of someones life then this is the book for you.  But if your buying the book to learn the darvas system of the stock market then this is not the book for you.  I gave this book a 1 star rating because the book jacket said that the book contained information about nicolas darvas' system for profiting in the market.  But nowhere in this book does he give you any information about it or how to use it. It sounds like all he did was buy a stock that was in a strong uptrend and then bought it when it passed the resistance level.  Nicholas also gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it shot up in price overnight and was restricted for anymore trading.  He ended up selling for 171 dollars a share and sold for a profit of 250,000.  His idea of buying resistance is nothing new and it sounds like he was lucky more than anything else.  
  Kim is nothing but a publicity tramp with no class or style. Please stop buying her albums b/c to me, it sounds like stereo porn. Great female MCs to check out: Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Roxanne Shante, even Salt N Pepa. What do they have in common? They were pioneers who didn't sell music with horrible lyrics and had class at the same time. So don't buy any of Kim's records and get something from the ladies I listed above. So now, your stereo system should be playing the right music 
  This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in "Darling" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her "Princess Diana" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in "Georgy Girl" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for "The Sound of Music" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of "Mary Poppins," for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.  I'm not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry's book "Alternate Oscars" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was 'The British Invasion,' but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie's other film "Doctor Zhivago" which was T.S.O.M.'s rival and added to the fact that "Zhivago" had no acting nominations. There's another Oscar problem: They don't know when to be hip.  Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or "The Manchurian Candidate" with Harvey, or "Modesty Blaise" with Bogarde.  In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar. Or as what Bogarde said to Christie: (a fitting way to close this review since that I end where it begins) "I don't take taxis that are filled with whores! 
 I was extremely offended by the author's disrespect towards his subject, not to mention bored to tears by his dusty writing-style. This book was written eighty years ago by a man who consistently belittles the spiritual beliefs of all non-christian peoples, and refers to the buddhist, taohist, and hindu cultures as being childish, pathetic, silly and to be pitied and ridiculed on many levels. His attitude towards dragons is nothing if not derisive. Do not be taken in by the book-jacket review and the playful cover. If you want a book tracking the rise of dragon worship throughout the world, but with little to no historical folklore, than this is your book. But if you are looking forward to reading entertaining dragon lore from around the globe, than this is NOT what you are looking for 
 Based on all the glowing reviews here of this toaster, I went and purchased one.  It does toast bread just fine. But it is absolutely lousy on bagels and english muffins. One half of the same side too dark and the other half of the same side not toasted at all. Figured that I had a bad one. Exchanged it for another and it does the same thing. I am very puzzled HOW it can do so poorly on round items, but it does. Tried inside in, inside out. Always the half closest to back of toaster burns before the half closest to the front gets any gold at all 
 I think some of the other reviewers are being too kind to Pretty Girls Make Graves on this album.  They have apparently abandoned their more melodic, interesting songs in favor of simple, boring dance-pop.  To make matters worse, they aren't even really very good at dance-pop.  Maybe the popularity of bands like Bloc Party has influenced them too much.  The album could have been saved if it had been recorded better and performed with any amount of energy and enthusiasm.  It sounds like it was recorded in a closet.  This is probably one of the most disappointing releases that I've ever purchased, I'm sorry to say.  Anyone looking for good Pretty Girls Make Graves records should purchase either "Good Health" or "The New Romance" because they are both great records.  I can only hope that they return to their own style and put out some better records in the future 
 Having been a fan of Taking Back Sunday since 2000, it doesn't matter how far away from this genre of music I stray, I'll always check out a new TBS album.   However, this album makes me want to cry. Where You Want to Be was a departure from Tell All Your Friends, yes. However, to be frank, that departure didn't suck. Louder Now is a departure from Where You Want To Be. However, this departure sucks.   Song by song:   What It Feels Like To Be a Ghost -50/5: Wtf is this song? Lyrically especially? This sounds like the [...] that ends up on the radio that people use as an example as why radio sucks.   Liar (It Takes Two) 3/5L: This song almost sounds like a demo from WYWTB. Lyrically, it belongs on that album. The intro riff is something that TBS has never used and it works well. However, the chorus is where the song falls apart.   Good Enough 1.5/5: This songs honestly sounds like TBS is trying to rewrite "New American Classic" but with the 'suprise' off electric guitars. Mediocore, at best.   MakeDamnSure 5/5: Now, this is a TBS song. It's hands down the best song on the CD. It sounds 100 percent like they put effort into this song. I suppose that's why it was the single.   Up Against 1/5: No Adam, No. Repeating the same thing over and over and over again doesn't make a song.   My Blue Heaven 4/5: Lyrically, this is the most mature song on the album. The intro is fantastic, as is the middle and end parts of the song. The chorus destroys the song but it can be expected (see "Liar"). However, the hint of strings makes the song all the more better.   Spin 3/5: The guitars in the song are blaring and for once on this album it's a good thing. However, it needs to be said that repeating one line over and over does not make for a song.   Miami 0/5: The chorus in this song is the primary reason I want to cry when hearing this album   Error Operator 3/5: It's a decent song but it's just not TBS.   ...I'll stop there because I think you all understand what I'm trying to say. However, I think these big label boys forgot one thing in their rise to fame that they really kinda needed: John Nolan. 
 I bought this book as I was interested in simulating in simprocess. The book is not useful at all neither for an experienced modeller, nor for a beginner. This is of no use for a practical modeller, theoreist or student.  It is more of an entertainment kind of book with very generalistic sporadic examples about where simulation application was successful and funny pictures, double space 16 font text with no content.   For beginners, one should rather buy "Business Process Simulation" by Laguna, which also has a student version of soft. One can go through simulation examples and learn a lot. (I bought this two books together)   In general, if you want to waist your time and money, and read something in half an hour and learn nothing, buy it. But but  does it make sense to pay for nothing and make the authors rich just because they are from GACI or Ernst and Young consultancy. Bad use of their brand to promote the sales of the bad book (but probably not so bad software 
 I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said "it IS ON!!" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing 
 I didn't want information about organizing a block party or winning the Tour de France, just my clutter filled closets!  I thought this book was about organizational skills to help you learn how to conquer your clutter.  Learning how to direct a film or become a model just wasn't the type of information I wanted 
 Mr. Johnson writes these essays with a clear style.  Sometimes the writing is engaging.  I am disappointed in the low density of facts and ideas.  Insights that might justify a paragraph or two are made to carry entire essays.  An example is the assertion that Mark Twain was an entertainer.  So far as I can see this is the only idea in the entire essay.  It is repeated, I think, four times, and stitched together with some fairly weak anecdotes.  Everything else in the essay is familiar to one who has never made a study of Clemens, except the disclosure that he copied his pen name from another newspaperman. Declarations of judgments seem to me to too often take the place of argued considerations.  And, too, I admit, I was put off by the obiter dictum identifying Ronald Regan as "that great man" for no given rhyme or reason.  In trying to sort out the benefit of this book to me, I realized that it made me look back on Johnson's histories of Christianity and art with new found skepticism.    I wish that I had waited for the paperback or scanned a few pages in a library, first. 
 I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo:  -I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! -The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly.  Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30. 
 Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste 10 dollars, you can rip up a 10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would. 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 Could this be yet another example of National University choosing the worst available text simply because it is written by one of their "professors"? If you buy it you WILL know and, yes, you do have my pity since the 1 Star rating may be a hyperbolic overzealous estimation of the quality & relevance of this text 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 This should be titled Lord of the Dance not feet of flames. The two shows are almost identical. If youv'e seen Lord of the dance then you have seen Feet Of Flames. There are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff. My biggest gripe is that Flatley seems way to full of himself in this one! I mean he is so in love with himself its anoying! I truely enjoyed his dancing in the original Riverdance filmed in Ireland, but id say after watching Feet of Flames he deserved getting bagged on by Mike Meyers!!! The sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show, and it reminds me more of Vegas show than anything else. Can someone please knock some sense into Flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door. That way I can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego 
 First must say all the raves you see are from professionals that have used other systems and maybe good friends of the author, as some of the reviews said, mistakes, no clear definition of way to go, confusing, believe the author once sent me an answer to a question stating he has condensed a book of 950 pages into this, Well unless your an photographic, or layout person, this book too confusing for someone starting out, I would not recommend  this book to first timer 
 I hate country music....I bought this as a gift for a friend 
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
 I purchased this book about a year ago while I was 5 months pregnant with my twin boys.  Immediately I discovered that many of the views were a bit outdated.  It is very evident that it was written before twins and multiples were as common as they are now.  Many of the concerns (doctor's offices, shopping, travel) discussed are simply not an issue any more. Most pediatrician offices are very well equipped and able to handle twin visits.  Nearly all grocery stores have those awesome shopping carts with infant seats already attached (a push/pull of two carts isn't that hard).  And as far as getting around, there are literally dozens of twin and triplet strollers available now.    I found the book to consistently present the worst of every situation. From clothes, to bathing and feeding nearly all the parents seem overwhelmed and frustrated.  It really isn't like that! My boys are 7 months old now and I can honestly say... raising them has been nothing like it seemed in this book.   I say, find a more a recently written book and one that is based here in the US if you live here.  The cultural differences and new commoness of multiples really make for a big difference.    Enjoy your babies, and relax! My twin theory is this:  Whatever you just did... You just do it again. 
 [this] book was ok, and I read [the authors'] first book. [The authors are] right on with diet and what to eat and what not to eat but perscritive drugs is not the answer.  They only sugar coat the problem.  Have to remove with a good candida program and lots of cultures that are natural.  Why won't...doctors get back to basic and start giving advice the natural way and don't chemical drugs that damage other organs like your liver and kidneys 
 After watching 36 minutes of this trite and cliché-ridden waste, I am bailing out on it.  It has totally failed to engage me or create the least expectation that there might be something interesting to come.  A total cardboard cutout production and a major disappointment from Clint 
 Anna Corba broke ground when she introduced a book that deals with using vintage epehemera in art projects. I applaud her for introducing the concept of use of ephemera in paper arts for the home artist. I am the admitted book junkie, so I buy them all. Although I had been reluctant, because of reviews,  I finally did buy the book at moderate discount. I, personally, was disappointed. Sandra Evertson, who may have taken her cue from Corba, produces a stunning and ultimately usable book 
 This band is great for people who don't know anything about folk music.  Use it to introduce your indie-rock friends to folk music.  However, if you're a true folk fan, you're going to be mighty disappointed.   There are a few essential things that would make this album (and this band) better.  First of all, generally speaking, fiddles should be kept in tune.  It doesn't have to be a standard tuning, it can be an odd cross-tuning, but any sort of tuning at all would certainly help out.  Sounds, er, obvious, huh?  Well, explain that to these guys.  Secondly, it makes for a nice change when songs sound different from each other.  Tempo-wise, tuning-wise, rhythm-wise.... it doesn't really matter, but a little variety is nice.  These guys don't seem to have that figured out either.  This album (and band) makes a relatively cheesy attempt to make folk cool, but they fail miserably.  Do yourself a favor and grab an album by The Horseflies, The Duhks, Donna the Buffalo, The Red Stick Ramblers, The Mammals, or any one of the other great "new trad" bands out there 
 examples are broken up and explanations are bland my teacher in this class is learning it with us and she has no clue its uber confusing but the programs compile good with the compiler we use which is blue j and J create 
 I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.     Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica 
 Nice coffee table book, but a great deal of Mails' stuff is either made-up or borrowed from squirrely popular romanticizations of Cherokee folks.  For a general if ideologically out-dated history, see Grace Steele Woodward, for culture see Mooney, Theda Perdue for work specifically on women, and for straight-up historical scholarship, try William McLoughlin's stuff 
 Perhaps this is more a sharing than a review.  My husband had Polio when he was 25 and for the next 51 years he was a quadraplegic who finished college and worked for 35 yrs.  He read this book and commented, the book gave many insights as to what life is really like from a wheelchair and that we are all different.   When he died suddenly two days after Christmas I purchased this book for every member of our family to read.   Arlyce, his wife 
 This is a moral relativist/post-modern/revisionist and (therefore necessarily) stridently anti-Christian tome. So undoubtably, some of you will enjoy it.  Ms. Lepore wrote this book primarily to add her singular invective onto the mountain of slanderous and false accusations already accumulated about the people who settled and built this country. (And I thought post-modernist were supposed to be nonjudgmental?)  A sample of the revisionist history Ms. Lepore regales us with is her assertion that torture (of the most hideous and unspeakable nature, well described in this book), practiced by the Indians against English settlers in King Phillips War, was really just as an expression of cultural norms in the Indian "community" and therefore not "wrong" in any absolute sense. Nevertheless Ms. Lepore is in high dudgeon when she describes one occasion when white settlers set fire to an Indian village and slaughtered women and children fleeing the flames.   Actually, the main value I obtained from this book was seeing in "vivid color", so-to-speak, just how bloody the Indian warfare really was. I'm no advocate of massacre, or genocide, but when you read this book it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out why "the white man" became so determined to exterminate the Indian. If one day you find yourself enjoying a pipe by the family hearth, with your family all around, and the next you find your home and barn burned to the ground, as well as the raped and mutilated remains of your loved ones scattered about the countryside, I think you might "evolve" some passionate feelings too.  
 Poorly written, poorly researched -- it's as if the writer had tried put together a great work of art from torn bits of cocktail napkins... and had a hard time filling in the gaping spaces between 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 The writing style leads me to believe that this book is written for older elementary school age to middle school age children, so thankfully it was a quick read. The entire book is just a piecing together of interviews. Marc Shapiro has never interviewed J.K. Rowling himself. So there wasn't anything new or all that interesting in the book if you've read the interviews JKR has given over the years.   Shapiro also does a very lazy job of updating the book by just tacking on new material every couple of years to the end.  Overall, it was a disappointment 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 I feel guilty giving Josh Lewin's book a rating of only two stars, but I should have looked more carefully before I bought the book.  I am a big Josh Lewin fan, and was disappointed when he left telecasting the Tigers with Kirk Gibson to join the Texas Rangers.  I grabbed the book as soon as I saw his name as the author, and I thought I was going to read about Josh's baseball experiences and the making of trades during baseball's winter meetings.  Instead, the book is about minor league teams auditioning audio tapes of prospective announcers looking for a minor league job at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville.  Some information is also provided regarding team mascots.  Had I looked at the book's contents before I bought it, I would have put it back on the shelf.  My rating of two stars is based on my interest level, not on the book's quality.  If you write another one on your baseball experiences, Josh, I will be sure to buy it, because I enjoy your work 
 The curiously gifted songwriter Stephin Merritt is best known as the guiding force behind several acclaimed indie-pop groups -- most notably The Magnetic Fields, who amazed, delighted, and sort of overwhelmed us all with the three CD collection 69 Love Songs (and then followed up with the underwhelming album i.) Over the past few years, Mr. Merritt has also written songs for three music theater productions by Chen Shi-Zheng, and Showtunes is jam-packed with 26 of them.  These tunes encompass everything you love (or perhaps don't?) about Stephin's songwriting -- they are clever and witty, compact and concise, tuneful and cloying... and a bit precious at times. There's one major problem however -- Stephin isn't singing any of them.  Instead, the Showtunes are (appropriately, I guess) performed by vocalists and choruses from "the original casts" in a mannered, over-enunciated, Broadway-esque style that sounds more like Gilbert & Sullivan than The Magnetic Fields. And sadly, I couldn't stand it.  Maybe listeners more enamored of musical theater than I am would not be as distracted by this (I can't stomach Cole Porter songs sung this way either.) Besides, the arrangements are fantastic, using unconventional ensembles that convincingly blend Asian instruments with lute, autoharp, accordian, marimba, and steel drums -- thankfully without the electronic clutter that sometimes intrudes upon Magnetic Fields productions. (Happily, a few instrumental selections are sprinkled throughout the CD.)  But unfortunately, all I could think about while listening to Showtunes was how much better these songs would sound if they were sung by Merritt's soulful, resonant, unpretentious baritone voice instead. And I suspect that many of his other fans will feel the same way, hoping as I do that Stephin has worked through this musical theater phase once and for all.  In the future, if he combines the formidable songwriting and orchestration skills heard on Showtunes with the sincere and direct vocal performances that graced so many of the 69 Love Songs, I expect to be amazed and delighted by Stehpin Merritt again and again.  Meanwhile, be forewarned: The Magnetic Fields meets The Mikado may not be your cup of Oolong tea 
 Being from Houston TX, I never really like alot of southern music unless it was like scarface or the getoboys...The south may be popular now because it's a easy way to recongnize just get some wack club beats and talk about clubbing or ice you got a hit...It's a easy sound to get like junior high kids to lsitened to what happened to the gutter rap about hustling and gangbanging and what happened to actually good production like rap from the 90's...The g funk beats need to come back street talk needs to back when rap was about pushing the boundries not being a bunch pussy like 90% of rappers are nowday's...And for the record 50 cent not a gnagters rapper he makes trl songs for 13 year girls and boys well g rappers dont do that(candyshop) that;s hardcore please...He might been shot 9 times but he doesnt rap like hood rapper... 
 This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version 
 I tried to force myself to the end of this book, but I couldn't. I enjoy mysteries, but there is no mystery here. I figured out what was going on in the first half of the book, and the prose was so bad that there was no reason to finish. Cornwell could use a class in creative writing or a good editor. Her style is amaturish and grating. Her over use of adverbs, tinny dialogue, and sloppy construction were annoying to read. If a character was about to disclose something important, Cornwell made sure you knew by telling you how important what they were saying was in the dialogue tag--like the reader is an idiot. I am amazed anything this bad made it into print 
 I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.  
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else 
 Yes, this book was a present from my father in law. He knew about my interest in digital photography and bought this book in Japan for me.   What to say about this book..hmmm..each time I look at its size and compare it with the shallowness of its contents it makes my blood boil. Seems Mr. Rick Sammons wants to keep the real knowledge to himself and dish out only a small fraction of it to the readers.  I have learned much more from the internet and from second hand magazines than from this hefty book. His constant reference to plugins ticks one off as it seems he never wants the reader to know about photoshop's potential and the effects the program can create itself (don't know how much he was paid by nik color efex..his favorite plugin) A hobbyist would love to know how to make fabulous images and not what Professional photographers have shot, about rules of composition (not just rule of the 3rds), exposure, 18% gray, how different colors in nature can assist you take a guess about the correct exposure if u donot have a grey card, how u can use the palm of your hand to take a meter reading, the use of manual mode for night photography, etc. All such vital information was either not given the required emphasis or was avoided completely by Mr. Sammons.   This book is a waste of money. Though my father in law paid for it, I still feel sad. If only I knew what he was buying and what the book was like, I would have advised him otherwis 
 it stings, burns and irritated my skin. didnt PREVENT any breakouts. i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most. 0 stars if i could. need i say more 
 First off, some of the scenes are beautifully filmed. Rich colors and angles. That's the only good thing, besides seeing Mia Farrow. The deaths are all a little complicated when executed...like a Mouse Trap Game. A roofer bumps a hammer, the hammer slides, hammer falls, striking metal thing on side of building, which swings downward and beheads. A lightening bolt strikes a spire, the spire falls from roof, spears stained glass, impales victim to ground, glass shards rain on the victim. Also, this death was filmed in a gloomy rain storm, but when they show the guy impaled, the gloom has lifted to almost sunny. Immediately.  Another mistake is when the father and the photographer meet a guy in a temple. The guy shows them swords that he unrolls from a canvas case. The dad and the photographer run outside, but the photographer grabs the swords and case and does not roll them back up. Outside, the dad and photographer argue. The dad shakes the case at the photographer and the case is rolled up and the swords put away neatly ina tight bundle. Oops...a goof.  Also, in the extras...the director's vocabulary is pretty rough. He must have been a sailor. Every sentence has the f word 
 Not so much a biography as a collection of every rumor, piece of gossip, and regurgitated negative story ever written about HRC, this "biography" reeks.  Compare her citations in the book to the  footnotes (most are post 1990 articles and books written about the  Clintons).  Milton never probes deeper to find out what the real story is.   She simply takes the previously published material as the final word.   According to Milton, NOTHING HRC has ever done-- from her ambition to win a  DAR award in high school to the health care debacle--was ever for the  proper reasons only to advance herself and her "agenda."  In one  rhetorical flurish Milton weaves HRC's '70s activist work into tangled  prose that references a communist front organization (as if to imply that  "see, HRC is a communist!")  According to Milton, HRC is a lying,  duplicitous, greedy, self-aggrandizing, icy virago and bad mother, who  demeans people "out of her radar"-- especially people "who  work for a living."  A woman who's failed at everything she's ever  done with a sense of humor that consists only in insulting people.  Oh!   And she snores!  On the other hand Wilton is quick to come to the defense  in a long paragraph of poor abused Tammy Wynette and her feminist  songs--another hard working woman HRC slammed in her ignorance of the  common people. The tip-off to the bias of the writer was the frequently  used word, "taxpayer," which almost becomes an outraged character  in the book along with Milton at times who can't help putting herself as  "we" into her judgements.  Maybe it will take 20 years before we  can truly have an unbiased biography of either Clinton.  This certainly  isn't it. (And this review is not a plant, but an outraged consumer wanting  my money back! 
 Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.  EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three 
 we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good.  the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again.  sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking.  
 The writing in this book plainly stinks.  The only reason it made it to print is it confirmed some Manhattan editor's insecure and snide prejudice about New Jersey.  To paint the Barnegat Bay in this sick and toxic light is a crime.  The author makes several flagrant errors in her geography and chronology, and in other places describes things, like her father walking on Reich Farm, that could not possibly have occurred.  It is a shame that she has spent her life so sick, but that surely has a lot to do with her mental anguish and alcohol and drug abuse, and little to do with these paranoid fantasies of Toms River and Barnegat Bay being poisonous.  I am just thankful I have not been forced to read her poetry, I'm sure it's equally as solipsistic, whiny and delusional 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I got it thinking it was going to be an interesting, fact-based, well-researched book on Mary Magdalene. Instead it was a hate-filled attack on not only Christianity but on Jesus Himself, describing Him as a drunken and gluttonous Egyptian magician no different than any other "nut" in Palestine claiming to be the Messiah. I really have nothing to add that hasn't been said in the many other negative reviews that this book gotten. As mentioned before by other reviewers, the author has a personal and childish agenda against Christ and the entire religion of Christianity and it is so transparent. Not only is the research flawed, with major misunderstandings about basic Christian beliefs like the Immaculate Conception, Apostolic Succession,the Authority of the Pope, et cetera, but as a psychologist I can see, in my opinion, some major emotional problems with this author. I won't go into a case study of her that I could come up with after reading her book,but the main problem is that after losing the high of her conversion experience, which she readily admits, she goes into the other extreme of hating Jesus and God and the Church and trying to keep up the high of that experience by writing a "National Enquirer" type of book to try to tear down Christianity.I was stunned and sickened by the venom she spewed onto Jesus and her sad and flimsy attempt to raise up Mary Magdalene into some kind of goddess. Sorry Lynn, but you have failed miserably.Not only is your book going into my garbage can, but it has strongly reinforced my love for Christ and my committment to His Church and the wonderful gift He has given to us in his life, death, and Resurrection. May God have mercy on your soul.. 
 I've seen this movie. Even with Tom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Geena Davis staring in it. I just couldn't enjoyed it. I found that both Madonna's character and Rosie O'Donnell's character were just flat awful. It took away from the movie, itself. 
 I used the Rapid Clear line for a few days and my face was burned.  My face turned all red, swollen, puffy, and itchy.  It's been a week since I stopped using it, and the swelling has only gone down a little.  I will never buy another Neutrogena product, again.  They are dangerous!!!!  And, they will ruin your skin like it ruined mine!!!!  I look like a burn victim 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I picked up this book thinking it would be suspenseful and maybe interesting. This book was nothing but confusing and left me extremely frustrated at the end. I definately do NOT recommend this book 
 This is a boring album from a boring band. It just want to turn it off everytime i hear it. Dont recomend it to any "real" music fan 
 In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.  Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:  Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.  Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.  Once said "continent" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.  Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?  Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.  The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.  Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!  I could have made a better movie with my camera phone. 
 I can't comment on the substance of the book because there's no way to read it.  My only advice is that if you purchase the book, DON'T buy a used one from Kudzu Books in Georgia.  They ship it via the postal service in a very flimsy envelope.  By the time you get it, it will be too mangled to read.  Worse, they give no hint as to how to contact them by email or phone.  Amazon is no help either 
 I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.    Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.  I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.  I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself.   Examples of what I mean:  some of the "bad girl" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, "bad for a good reason" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl! 
 Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product 
 Is this really written by THE Jeffrey Archer? Reads like a very poor impersonation of the man who wrote classics like Not a penny more, To cut a long story short, Twelve Red Herrings, etc. Since his trial and jail term, his ability to write has degenerated to amatuerish tales. This book reads like a Hardy Boys Novel..."Search for the Missing Painting" Sorry but Mr.Archer you'll will have to try harder to please your die hard fans! 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 This is a decent book outlining the basic tenets of libertarian philopshy on how things work in the real world. My problem with the book is it never deals with the real issues of the left with free trade that is the doctrine being pushed on Thrid World countries. Then the arguments become absurd. Unions have become more militant in the US because of their lack of power and Mexican women are happy to work 80 hours per week and love taking birth controll pills evry morning as prerequsit to employment (Roberts dosent say this but these are the conditions under whihc many people work in free trade zones. So if he claims Mexicans love the jobs that are brought through NAFTA and dont want clean drinking water or clean air then they must love these conitions). And i love this argument: America had sweathops too. But the book forgets to mention that free trade  did not improve the conditions of wrokers in this country, collective actions by the workers did.  Also a little history fact: No country has ever industriliazed through free trade and that is the truth no matter what your economics books tell you.  However, this does not delegitimize the free trade doctorine but it is certainly something that needs to be talked about.  Read Globalization and Its Discontents by Stieglitz instead 
 This book is nothing but a self-congratulatory epistle for India written by a man with modest writing and intellectual skills.  His constant use of terms like "massive" and "huge" when describing increases in business volumes, his complete lack of significant or comparative statistics and his untamed proclivity for hyperbole leaves the reader both bored and breathless.  The tale brings to mind the threats, twenty years ago, that Japan would "buy the United States and rent it back to us."  That "miracle economy" has been in uninterrupted recession since at least 1990.  This author bases his arguments on "because I say so" reasoning extrapolated from his being Indian himself and any notion that there might just be a little bias in his thinking is squashed by his playing of the Race Card early in the book.  Then, after selecting quotes only from sources supporting his outrageous claims, he feels free to prognosticate about India's future without the need for any verifiable facts to support his thesis.  Most entertaining was his claim that India will emerge as a military power.  India has not put a credible army in the field for a couple thousand years.  Since independence, they have either lost every conflict in which they were a participant (like against China) or fought to a bloody stalemate (like Pakistan).  Perhaps the author longs for the days of the Bengal Lancers but modern conflicts do not typically involve bayonet charges or mounted cavalry actions.  This book has interesting ideas for serious study but it would be foolish to consider this the last word on the future of India as an economic force.  The author dismisses or ignores far too many important issues for that.  Example: what about the near nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan just a few years ago?  If such a confligration were to take place, in what kind of shape would that leave India's infrastructure and economic viability?  It is too real a possibility to be ignored but the author manages to do just that.  What about the AIDS epidemic rampaging through India and the rest of South Asia?  That disease has decimated a generation of leadership in Africa and it has just begun its grisly process in India?  Further, supposing the author's predictions do come to pass...who, then, will be able to purchase all these products and services coming from India?  Not an impoverished and unemployed America, to be sure.  Buy this book just to say you've done it.  It's not worth much more than a casual read 
 These authors were brave trying to write a lasting hardcover on technology that dates faster than sliced bread. Sure, the information is comprehensive and tries to cover all technologies, but in such a general way that those of us with more than a skerick of knowledge will get bored quickly 
 If you are interested in this book, good chances you have a child with Asperger Syndrome or PDD-NOS. You should familiarize yourself with these topics before labeling him/her an Einstein 
 Some of the worst DVDs that I have purchased. I wouldn't waste my money on any more of these POS discs. I wish I could return them to amazon, but for what I paid (it was pretty cheap), its not worth the effort. 
 Need a quick lesson in intolerance for your child? Try this despicable & poorly written book. Totally inappropriate for this age group. Lacks any nuance, and deals only in hackneyed and offensive stereotypes. It is depressing that parents feel the need to indoctrinate their children in this way, at this age. I am an educator, and I am appalled 
 The blurbs on the back give this book away. Law teachers and lawyers think it is excellent. No historians are included in any of this praise. As an exercize in rethinking the constitution this is an enjoyable, thoughtful piece of work. But Fletcher has not read much about Abraham Lincoln's actions and ideas. He is especially off course in claiming that Lincoln ignored the constitution in the midst of war. Lincoln practiced law for a quarter of a century, gave major speeches on the meaning of the constitution, followed the constitutional requirements on suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus--at least the leading constitutional lawyer in Congress, Reverdy Johnson, the patriarch of the American Bar, Horace Binney, and the profesor of constitutional law at Harvard thought. Fift 
 Even though I purchased this watch for my grandson for Christmas from another store, it was not worth the money. It does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it.  I picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night.   I did see on one toy store's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better. I wish I had known that before I spend $10 on this piece of junk.  
 It's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film.  How could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy?   If this film is considered groundbreaking then I fear for our Republic 
 Powell's analysis takes place in an economic vacuum, where all Americans had to do was wait out the four years of economic collapse, and the roaring twenties would have reappeared. The simple truth is that Roosevelt and the New Deal saved capitalism (that out to set off some of you, I'm sure). By 1933, capitalism had fallen into disrepute; only by regulating its excesses, and providing a safety net for its victims, is a part of it in existence today 
 I am using this book for a financial derivatives class and it is very poorly written especially for someone new to derivatives.   ** The book does not have complete definitions, explanations on topics or clear examples:    I have had to buy a couple of other books to understand some of the concepts he talks about. Either he will just define and let you figure out on your own why a trader might use that particular strategy or give you some information but no example of how it would work in real life.  ** He jumps all over the place:    I found it difficult to understand some of the concepts as  either he would abruptly stop talking on a topic and start on something else or mix things which I feel do not make a whole lot of sense. My classmates feel that he just collected a lot of material from other books or online and chopped and slashed the material till he reached some size. (maybe his publisher/editor told him there is a word limit ;) ).   ** The questions in the back of the chapter are either not clear or not easily solvable(cannot be answered from the material in the chapter or deriving it from the material in the chapter)     I have had to spent time at CBOE, wikipedia and other websites to understand what he talking about and to answer the questions. (Had to do it for class)  After reading 6 chapters and spending countless hours trying to answer the questions at the end of the chapters, I feel that I have not gained anything from this book other than a list of topics to search google on.  Just to clarify, I am used to books on complex topics (3rd Masters) but have not seen a more confusing book 
 I find that I hardly use this product. The holder clip broke almost immediately and the unit does seat well with my iSkin attached. When it is connected I wasn't happy with the performance. I hoped to use this when I mountain biked, but it just doesn't perform 
 What's with people always praising this _______ band?  Stones suck.  Unlike their opposite enemies (or basically, their mirrored version) The Beatles, the Rolling Stones did not do _____ for rock.  All they did is create another _________ bad-boy image for fat bikers (don't think I'm insulting motorcycle enthusiasts) who ride around with their morons and call themselves "Hells Angels".  No evolution of any kind, nothing ot look forward to, and _____ lyrics.  NOthing wrong with fun lyrics, but The Rolling Stones's lyrics were typical, mindless, thoughtless, retarded, I could go on.  NOthing wrong with suggestive (Can't use  that other th ree letter word because amazon won't post my review) lyrics, but goot ahave something clever, like the great song "The Bad Touch".  The music itself also sucks.  Boring, simple, repititive, and boring.  Hoe can people like this mess of crappy generic beats and music, I have no clue.  Ballads?  DOn't give a _____ what they have, The Beatles were about 100 times better, and these old ______heads still don't no when to quit.    I must admit, I was a bit of a sheep (_____) and went blindly, but I am cimpletlyt out of that and with every overrated band I hate, I am getting closer to my own opinons forming.  SO if you see me write a hate review for Altar Of Madness despite evbery metalhead  praising it.  So Don't get mad okay?  So in closing, I leave you withb these word: deal with it, you ________.  PS  Reaaaaaaaaly bad example.  Altars of Madness rules.  If you don't have that now, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!  I was going to review it next, but some reason, Rolling Stones just came up to me.  My next review will be for Altars of Madness 
 I bought this as Christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to Italy this spring as part of a College course she is taking, and she will be spending a semister there next year as well ... She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ... The RosettaStone WebSite/Knowledgebase offers NO information on this 
 There really wasn't much information in this book.  As an adult, you should be able to dress yourself for runs in differing weather but this was the type of information that was contained in this book.  The training program with speed work is essential to lowering your marathon time which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to one.  Unless you want the VERY basics of marathon training/running, I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 Claiming that this fan's "3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air. On high, it still doesn't move much air, and is incredibly quiet, nearing silent in my opinion. If you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads, this is NOT the fan for you. The 3-speed switch is useless, as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 I was initially interested in the newly emerging field of visual studies, however after reading several of elkins' other books as well as taking a course taught by the author, I have lost what interest I had.  This book follows similar themes as his others and while it does a fantastic job of presenting problems within the field, it does not present any feasible alternatives. Concerning the images included, it is problematic that elkins does not then interpret at least some of the images.  However, I do not believe that elkins is leaving this task for the reader to do.  Having listened to his lectures I believe that elkins includes the images simply because they strike him in some way or another, not because they have any relevance to the field in question.  This lack of relevance seems to pervade the majority of his literature and indeed the field as a whole 
 No Doubt has really evolved over the many years they have been together.  Unfortunately, this album came out before they put out great rock songs that I associate them with.  This album is so annoying.  Only tracks nine through twelve bear repeated listening.  The rest sounds like torture used to drive criminal holdouts out of their homes and into the waiting arms of police officers.  Gwen Stefani sounds like a manic hamster, and the band seems caught in a frantically spinning hamster wheel of polka music, with aging marimba players delightedly playing their horns.  One song is about eating all kinds of food, with a nice belch at the end.  Grow up.  Instead of this album, I highly recommend, No Doubt, The Singles (1992 - 2003) 
 As a fan of Margaret Frazer's medieval mysteries, I was hoping for something similar in this, the first of Sharon Kay Penman's that I've read.  However, Penman's book struck me as deeply anachronistic in its rendering of her characters, their dialogue, and their motivations--more like a Hollywood costume drama than a convincing representation of medieval life 
 Jamie Langston Turner has been one of my favorite authors for years, but this book was a major disappointment.  While it starts out mildly enjoyable, it soon becomes almost painful to make it through to the nauseating ending.  If you enjoy extremely sappy romances, then this book is for you; if not, save your money.  Hopefully we can expect better from Ms. Turner in the future, more along the lines of her first books 
 I am sorely disappointed in this book.  I LOVE to read all types and genres of books, and was extremely excited to receive this due to all the glowing reviews.  I took it with me on a mini-vacation expecting a quick, witty, relevant read.  After 5 chapters, I finally put it down because I simply couldn't take any more.  To me it seems like the author is simply trying to make excuses as to why she doesn't do this or that (i.e. clean her house or kids, cook, etc.) Do yourself a favor...  borrow this from the library before spending your hard earned money.  If you like it enough, then buy it.  This is one book that will not make it into my collection 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat. I got neither. It is pretty , but that is about it. 
 Best:  Original 1976 cast, #2:  Japanese Cast  #3  Norwegian Cast  #4  Mexican Cast  #5  Italian Cast  #6  Revival Cast  #7  Vienna Cast  About the new one:  I, for one am not a fan of the new orchestrations (saving money?...smaller pit?...too much synth).  Love "At the Ballet"  The additional montage is just rather tedious to me.  As for Ms D'Amboise--boy that girl can't sing.  Many vocal coaches in the city...she needs one...also just a tad long in the tooth for the role.  Alas.  As for them excluding "And"...it is an amusing song...maybe it's a blessing that it's not included with this cast!  
 "Born in the twenties to nomadic, bohemian parents, Paula Fox was left at birth in a Manhattan orphanage..."  What a range of people she had caring for her over her growing up years, what neglect at times, what an interesting range of geographic locations she lived in during her childhood.  This "memoir" seemed to hold such promise, but really I found it a chore to read.  A collection of memories, not always connected up, it never hooked me in, leaving me eager to find out what happened next.  It also completely lacks any analysis - of the characters, events, Paula's reaction to them, the impact on her life, etc.  Its main redeeming feature for me was its brevity - had it been longer, I may well have given up.  Maybe if I was a fan of her novels (certainly her memoir is well written), or interested in other members of her family (apparently she is Courtney Love's grandmother), I would have been more motivated to enjoy rather than just tolerate this book 
 This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today 
 I can't help by not like anything about this movie. The actors seem to be as uninterested in making the movie as I was in watching it.  I returned it so fast it made the cashier dizzy.  Skip this stinker. Trust me.  You'll have more fun at the dentist 
 Bought this player to amuse a 3 year old on a plane ride, worked the whole trip just fine, got home just stopped working.  (gives the error of "wrong disk" when trying to play a DVD I know works fine) All of the disk play was supervised by me, so I know it was nothing the kid did...I then looked up the web site to send in for repairs found out it would cost almost $100 to fix!  That's almost the cost of the player itself.  What a scam, sell an inferior product and expect the consumer to fork over repair costs or buy an new one, well not me.  Go to a different brand 
 First off, let me just say that I LOVED the first three books. So when I learned that a fourth was to be released, I was thrilled. So when I got in and read it, I was really disappointed. A lot of the plot lines that Ann Brashares has been cultivating since book number 1 seemed to go out the window. It was almost as if she decided she didn't like them after all. Both Carmen and Lena had love interests at the end of the third book, yet neither is so much as mentioned. The third book made it seem like Lena had finally gotten over Kostos, and had moved on to Carmen's shy step-brother. Carmen meanwhile seemed quite happy with Win. Personally, I thought the character of Win was good for Carmen. In the fourth book, Carmen no longer even has Win, but she has turned into a shy, loner of sorts on the Williams college campus. My spring semester of college is just now ending, and I have to say that none of the girls' first years of college seemed accurate. No one could change as much as Carmen did in the first year. Bee finally has the man of her dreams, and it seems odd to me that she would forget Eric so fast and believe herself not to be in love with him anymore. Also, she never seemed to be the type to jet of to Turkey for a summer long dig. The dig also seemed unrealistic. From what I know of them, it takes a long time just to find one piece, yet they were finding whole skeletons and complete pieces of pottery. Not exactly realistic. Lena, the one character who I relate the most too, never would have posed nude for a fellow painter before. The character of Leo is almost to perfect, and not exactly believable. She also has reverted to dwelling on Kostos again. I thought she had gotten over him and had moved on to Paul. Kostos even makes an appearance in the book, in what is quite possibly the most bizarre scene I have ever read. I even had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on. The whole conclusion of her relationship with Leo was a bit sudden and unexpected as well. Now, on to Tibby. First of all, let me just say that I think it is way out of Brian's character to push sex with Tibby. I also think it is out of character for him to smuggle a bottle of wine into her dorm. While I do think he is the type of guy to visit her as often as he does, I still can't believe he rides a bus for 12 hours every weekend just to see her. It's understandable when Tibby freaks out over her pregnancy scare. However, I would have hoped she would have matured enough to not shut Brian out when he so obviously was trying to help her.  I could go on, but I won't. I will say that there were several nice scenes with Bridget, her father, and her brother Perry. Otherwise, I would recommend the just first three novels 
 This novel relies too much on far fetched ideas and coincidences.  I thought it was boring 
 The film opens with three men arriving at a house. They draw their pistols and rush in. Shots are fired, and Tuco escapes. Then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house, searching for "Jackson". He learns the new name of "Bill Carson" (they were part of a gang of robbers). There is an exchange of opinions, shots are fired. The bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss, and perform another job. Next we see a wanted man captured by three men. Another man shows up to eliminate the competition, like a lion driving away hyenas. The wanted man is turned in for the reward. But his hanging is prevented, and he rides away to be recycled. [Can you believe this?]  Tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him, the tables are turned. [This is like a cartoon.] Just like it looks like it is over for "Blondie" a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story! A dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll. Now Tuco must care for "Blondie" because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure. As they ride away, they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them. The gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms. [Another joke.] Now they are prisoners and sent to a camp. [Was there really combat in the southwest?] This film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters.  Tuco manages to escape from the train. Later "Blondie" escapes and they meet again. There is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal. They arrive at a huge cemetery, much too large for the small town shown in this film. [Obviously staged.] And so there is a showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Scratch one rival. The film ends with a sick joke about hanging. I wonder why some people rate this film highly?  The vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language. [Isn't it funny?] The most interesting part is how a 1950s style Western was created by Europeans after they became obsolete in Hollywood. Not that they can't do better. 
 ...the writing is so bad.  Moralizing, snide remarks, sarcasm.  I can understand why the author dislikes Samuel Comstock, but I'm not willing to sit through any more of this mediocrity. A tale like this needs to be either an adventure story or an honest attempt to understand the people involved.  This is neither. 
 These walkie-talkies do not work - period.  You could be 3 feet apart or 200 feet apart and it does not matter, 99 times out of a hundred you can not hear the other person.  My kids were crushed and I had to return the item 
 I think this product is highly overated and this claim of being 99% accurate is false. Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when you realise that the very next sentence is complete gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted what you have in that manner. I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results while  a person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training. In summary I think the program is unreliable with an accuracy of 45% at its present level of developement. It has plenty of potential and with future developement  it could much more reliable but at its present level of developement I think the performance is mediocre.   
 Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.  As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?  I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.  What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.  Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.  I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?  One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book 
 Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.   On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 Its a low level polemic against social sciences. The author holds up evolution to explain modern human societys. Something between Wilson and "The bell curve" His knowledge about social sciences is not funded.. 
 It looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it 
 Jonathan Pond doesn't provide a financial game plan.  He rehashs the obvious information readily available.  The disappointment, in the end, is that his advertised website becomes another pay for service 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men. If you just want underwear look on; however, if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less. At is unless the view is everythin 
 If only Mollie Katzen's food was as feather weight as her gee whiz, Ma, tone. But is there anyone nowadays (short of people running a marathon) who can eat like this? Obviously, Katzen hasn't gotten the message that America's gone low carb. However what she lacks in recipes, she more than makes up for in enthusiasm. Back when she was leading the vegetarian vanguard, (look behind you, there's no one on that parade anymore), her hype convinced because all the world needed encouragement to eat veggies. But now we've heard that a million times. So she's turned her attention to breakfast (whoopee! it's breakfast) but this presents a major challenge, because eating French toast, porridge and the other foods she recommends more often than once a season will fatten you up real fast. I realize that recipe books like this one are mostly just fantasy reading as most people try to stick to the latest diet-- and usually people who write them don't pretend to be health conscious. But Ms. Katzen does. What happens when your healthy shtick is no longer healthy 
 Read this one a year ago and found it to be very non specific in the elements necessary to gain compliance.  Now after three SOX engagements and having to deal with the intricacies of 404, this book stands as a poor introduction to the enormity of the task to follow.    If however one wishes to get a brief overview of what compliance and governance will mean to public companies, read away. 
 Book is poorly organized into systems rather than regions.  It's a little too ridiculously simple especially for medical students.  There no are review questions to test yourself.  I picked up a couple of ideas for remembering structures but otherwise would stick to the Board Review Series Anatomy review.  Might be good for undergraduate anatomy though 
 If you want to know how many girls dylan slept with, this is the right book! I am really happy that I borrowed this book from the library, I would have given it away if I had bought it....It says everything about bob dylan except his music....and who cares about bob dylan but for his music 
 This was Rand's first work of nonfiction, and it is supposed to be an introduction to her philosophy of Objectivism. But it is certainly not the best place to start. The book consists of one rather lengthy essay, followed by excerpts from her four novels. As expected, more pages are devoted to excerpts from Atlas Shrugged than to any of the other novels - in fact, than to all of the others put together. Galt's seventy-plus page speech is included in its entirety.  Unfortunately, the excerpts aren't as interesting outside the context of the novels. Even worse, the title essay is probably the weakest Rand ever wrote. In it, Rand attempts to explain all of history in terms of the two types of men who have dominated it, Attila and the Witch Doctor. Attila represents those who have ruled men by force, whereas the Witch Doctor represents the irrational mystics who have controlled men's minds. The whole thing is just plain ridiculous.  If you want to know what Rand thought, you'd be better off starting with The Virtue of Selfishness, followed by Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. 
 After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome.  His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived.  One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc.  This information could have been presented in a two page spread.    Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique.  The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout.  If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.'  Papazian's  book will most likely be a complete disappointment 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others 
 I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.  It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.  The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:  First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.  Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:  The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .  The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.  It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.  I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door 
 When I lived in Santa Fe,parts of the movie were being filmed at a ranch outside the city.There was a fire on the set---which sounds prophetic.It foretold a disaster.  I've seen the first 20 minutes&last 20 minutes of this movie,since the rest is unwatchable.In fact,these segments are unwatchable.There's a gross scene involving a head (even Will Smith looks like he's about to vomit).Kenneth Branagh has tons of awful make-up that would put Tammy Faye Bakker to shame&an unconvincing moustache.The dialogue between Smith&Branagh is made up of terrible racist&impotence jokes.Branagh,after all,has a bevy of scantily-clad beauties.  The final scenes are one looooong chase scene.Ohh,the agony!Avoid this movie at all costs 
  This book is the perfect example for why this time is now being called the post-literature period. Dull opinions given without any insight. Simple minded writing filled with buzz word and sound bite diatribe. He takes no chances, the issues in each chapter are either of low impact or outdated. The chapter on O.J. Simpson is a perfect example of his desire to just fill pages with anything in order to get a book published. Long gone are the days of Upton Sinclair and Thuber. Writers now come in the form of pop stars or even worst Fox news personalities. If Kafka had a frontal lobotomy he would still write a more coherent and insightful book 
 I am a musicain. This book is wrong. This book is perfect for people who are looking to blame the problems of society on everything but society itself(themselves). Music is a product of society, not the other way around as Tame argues. David Tame is insane! 
 First I must mention that the package or manual does not say this card supports Linux, but it's using Realtek 8169 chipset which driver 'r8169' is already in kernel 2.4 or 2.6, I downloaded the latest 'r1000' and still couldn't get anything higher than 80Mbps under kernel 2.4.20.  Some users reported on newsgroup for this known performance issue on Linux, and one was able to crank it up to 240Mbps running a 3.2GHz AMD system.  Since this card is not meant to support Linux and I haven't tried it on Windows I would give it a 2 stars to be fair 
 Jenna Marshall is a high school chemistry teacher.  Steven Hatcher is a cop whose son is suddenly failing Jenna's class.  They are instantly attracted as he literally runs into her in the hall and is intrigued because she wears garters (to school???).  She's flunked the star football player, Rudy Lutz, and now someone is vandalizing her car, classroom, etc.  He's on the hunt for a serial killer who kidnaps cheerleaders, shaves their heads and mutilates them while at the same time trying to raise 3 boys.    Funny how their problems seem to have a way of coinciding.  After loving Rose's first book, I'm Watching You, I was very disappointed in Have You Seen Her?.  The plot has holes you can drive a Mac truck through.  Such as, given the killer's modus operandi, why would he instead break into Jenna's apartment and try to stab her?  And why, after Steven's declared that Jenna needs round the clock protection, does he just leave her sitting alone for hours at the school where her tormentors knowingly lurk because he can't get around to picking her up or sending someone else to get her?  And how can they daily vandalize her classroom in a locked school?  And ... unfortunately, there's way too many to list them all.  I'm Watching You may have had similar plot flaws but if so I didn't notice because I loved the interaction between the characters.  Not so here.  Jenna was fine, but Steven was a whiny whimp, with the romance constantly interrupted by something stupid that he does.  I haven't given up yet on Rose; I'll try her next one with the hope that it's much more like her first book and much much better than this one 
 This is the worst book I have ever read on film. Ray waxes philosophical and intellectual over film exhaustively, yet fails to understand film as an art. "A Certain Tendency" is only applied to films from the pre 1980's period, I can only assume this is because his theories are lost and become broken when applied to modern film. This book could have been a well written fifty pages if Ray abstained from numerous, short sighted examples of his failed theories.   I unfortunately had the pleasure of using this text in conjunction with a Contemporary Film class. This book cannot be used for what Hollywood Cinema has become or was becoming in the 1970's. If you happen to take a class in which this book is required and you love movies for their entertainment or art, drop the course. Any instructor who assumes the mantle of Ray's theories cannot have appreciation for and assign value to films as artistic texts.  However, if you like the idea that all film is a simple regurgitation of the like themes, characters, and faceless historical contexts; and that film in itself can never be compelling and original; and that film can never truly teach, inspire, or edify...then this book is for you. It's central theme of "Avoidance of Choice" on the thematic level (i.e. film always makes an attempt to satisfy two contrasting ideologies and present them as cohabit, like individualism and collectivism; meaning film never promotes the value of one over the other), is confusing, contradicting, and above all exhausting.  Ray is an articulate writer, favoring long, multi-syllable words used in a mind-boggling context of confusion often eliciting the feeling that he is a desperate theorist, grasping at straws to support weak, simplistic ideals. While his intelligence is genuine, his consumption in a background of English, and most likely rhetoric, makes for an un-compelling dissection of film and their meaning 
 I was disapointed to discover that this book covers the same information (at some times nearly word for word) as Ms. Hart's weekly column.  However, the book's new material is entertaining and I agree with some of book's concepts regarding setting limits and limiting choices 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 This book is a fluff piece.  Has anyone in the industry really ever heard of this author?  Has she produced, directed, or done anything of consequence?  I don't think so.  She obviously runs an A+ hype machine.  That you have to give her credit for. 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 If you want the why and the wherefore ... stay away.  Informative to general audiences, it provides little scientific support for its contention.  With the wealth of information out there, this was not the critical review needed, nor was it terribly informative about any particular statin-caused effect 
 I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned.  My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out.  I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met.  The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long.  She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message.  I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar.  She should stay out of our "fiction" world. 
 Morris Lamb dies suddenly of what appears to be plant poisoning: his plants.  When his house is sold to an Episcopalian priest and her deaf dog companion starts to have seizures, Holly Winter, dog writer and lover, starts to investigate.  I have enjoyed this series that takes place in Cambridge, Ma. I'm definitely a dog person and these are definitely dog lovers books, filled with all kinds of tips and tidbits on dog companions.  I was extremely disappointed in this one, however.  The writing is choppy.  The characters that haven't already been introduced in previous books are underdeveloped.  Conant often seems to babble. I didn't really understand how her opening statements about aliens and ufo's had anything to do with dogs.  The Dog Lover's Mysteries have been a favorite of mine so I'm going to give it another chance and read the next one, but I wish someone had told me earlier not to waste my time on this one.   
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books, especially five dysfunctions of a team, which is one of the most elegant frameworks i've seen on team dynamics.  lencioni's solution to silos and politics?  a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics.  it's a lot more complex than just that, and i'm surprised he didn't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership, which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem.  if you're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization, keep looking.. 
   I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the "look at it a week from now and see how you feel" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it. 
 I am concerned that the title of this book implies that those people who suffer from clinical depression are somehow at personal fault for their disease and, perhaps even worse, have somehow "failed" if they take prescribed medications to remain healthy 
 The author reveals himself and not the topic.  The American revolution was complex like all human dramas.  Historians give meaning when they bring to the surface the facts and attempt to place them both within the context of that time and within a philosophy.  The author certainly brings his philosophy to the endeavor, but he utterly fails to provide the context of the times.  In the end, he might as well have written something about modern times, as it would be equally revealing 
 Too many disadvantages: 1. No battery backup 2. Even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance. 3. You'd be expecting better sound from this unit. It's acceptable with the radio, but CD sound quality is extremely poor. 4. etc. 
 I read this book for my own joy and thought it was going to be one of the best books I have ever read.  I was proven wrong, reading the book I LOVED it!!! There were so many interesting events happening and so many good ones and exciting ones.  But in the last 20 pages of the book, you find out that the whole story was all fake.  Reading that, I was VERY disappointed.  I felt that I wasted my WHOLE time reading that book.  The last 5 pages is the final end and it was ,of course, rushed.  The book was very good in the action part of it but like I said there was NO point to this book.  This book had SO much potential on being something as great as Harry Potter and the author has written it so well but there was no point.  This  is the first time I have ever question on reading the sequel to a series (Voices).  Even though I didn't like this book I MIGHT read voices just because there is a whole different set of characters (I think).   DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!!!!! 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 This books is a tough read, Mr. Tanenbaums explanations of concepts is very loopy and confusing at best.  I have a fairly strong foundation in Operating Systems but still this book leaves me dazed.  In addition to this book I have Operating Systems by Deitel and Stallings and I find that they manage to convey the concepts of OS much more clearly than Mr. Tanenbaum.  I would strongly recommend against this book, even keeping it as a reference is a no-go especially considering the cost 
 I got this thoughtful gift from someone who felt they were getting me a quality product since it is Cuisinart.   But, it is truly awful.  The worst thing is how loud it is. I'd like to know what the decibel level of this noise is because it is probably off the charts.  I'd probably use it more if it wasn't for this and the fact that it is really super heavy.  Cleaning it is like a workout for your upper arms.  And it doesn't clean up quickly.   Apart from this it works good but this for me is a major downside.  I wish it would break so I could justify purchasing a different blender 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here 
 Based on the ratings, I suspect kindhearted people think they SHOULD praise this film because of the likeability of its stars.  But from the heavyhanded appearance of "Death" to the self-conscious acting styles to the endless songs (you deserve a medal if you don't ever hit fast forward), this simply does not even approach the charm, wit and easy musicality of the Prairie Home Companion radio show.  Also, the DVD transfer seems a bit dark 
 Well, if you think you will hear the song you heard in the commercial on TV, forget about it. It is not on the soundtrack. How does that work? Most of it is instrumentals that sound as if they were recorded underwater. Hey, maybe they were for Mermaids. Oh, well. I am out but I hope you save your money.  
 I'm sorry that I bought this book.  The grammar is terrible, and the author (or his editor) doesn't even know the difference between principal and principle.  The author cannot settle on one word or phrase for a concept, but generally, and repeatedly uses three.  Save your money 
 The book contains some useful examples and case studies but overall feels like advertising for author's valuation website. A lot of information is repeated in several places 
 Sent it back.  Couldn't see the read-out with a plate or saucer on the scale.  Needs a tilted or canted face 
 The author reveals himself and not the topic.  The American revolution was complex like all human dramas.  Historians give meaning when they bring to the surface the facts and attempt to place them both within the context of that time and within a philosophy.

In the end, he might as well have written something about modern times, as it would be equally revealing 
 Liar liar  pants on fire! Not worthy of a 1 rating, but system requires at least a 1 star rating 
 Since you're reading about this book, I assume you're interested in a scholarly work, as opposed to "Idiot's Guide" or "___ for Dummies" style.  In this case, I recommend that you read instead "The Legacy of Jihad" by Andrew Bostom and Hugh Fitzgerald, a scholarly work that is more comprehensive, better researched, and more objective.  I purchased both books, but after reading a few hundred pages of both, I decided to keep "The Legacy of Jihad" and return "The Venture of Islam" to the bookstore 
 I purchased this coffee grinder in July of 2003.  I love the design and the color matches our other teal accented kitchen items perfectly.  It does a decent job of ginding coffee, but after only 5 months, of once a day use, it started to develop vertical stress cracks in the plastic casing around the top.  As of right now (January 2004), more cracks have developed and the initial cracks have become even longer (going down below the interior stainless steel "bowl").  Because of all the cracks, the lid now fits very loosely, and I'm afraid that with more use, the cracks will continue to extend downward, rendering the entire unit unusable.  The stainless steel cased version may be the way to go, but since we don't have any stainless steel accessories in our kitchen, I will be replacing my grinder with another brand 
 Somewhere in the universe, statistically speaking, there has to be a band more stultifying than Rush. It's hard to imagine that God could be so cruel, but remember, she gave us Boston (the band, that is) too. This stuff is so painful, it almost makes rap sound good 
 This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced. Regardless of where you stand politically, Johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree. Throughout this work Johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities. 
 I bought this movie on recommendation from other customers here on Amazon.com ... okay, I bought this movie because Viggo Mortensen was in it :O)  And boy, I just shouldn't have bothered.  What a weak script.  The characters are formulaic, the dialogue wooden and cliched.  There are no surprises, no insights - I came away from this movie not caring if the entire camp blew up.    Perhaps this is a difference in cultures, I'm not sure, but as an Australian I found this movie to be sickeningly Disneyesque in its portrayals.  Not worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of your time over - even for Viggo 
 Don't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like I did.   The earlier ARTISAN release is still much better than this special edition.   The image is better and ALSO the sound.   I don't know what Lions gate thought they were doing, but remastered? no.   I compared both several times before writing this even though I only had to compare once.   Might as well wait for a HD DVD to come out, this is a waste unless you want the additional features 
 I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. Nothing specific. Just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do. You could do this yourself without a book 
 Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. "Naked", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song "All Because Of You", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, "Naked" & "Sex Wit You" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY) 
 $100 for a casserole dish?  You have got to be kidding.  I don't care how good it is.  For $100 it better load itself up, walk itself over to the oven, turn it on and get in.  I pity anyone who buys this.  $100 is bad enough but look at it.  What's wrong with cookware that looks like cookware 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 As compared with the earlier edition, unfortunately there is very little that is new here. Also, as is true in the earlier edition, there are not enough visual examples of either the building blocks or the arrangements. For the very useful basis ideas, buy a used copy of an earlier edition 
 Half paean to old-time radio, half murder mystery, this overly melodramatic WWII-era set novel lurches along for far too long before petering out, exhausted with itself. I've enjoyed Dunning's "Bookman" series, and I like historically set mysteries, so picking this up seemed like a no-brainer. But Dunning overextends himself with this one. The story revolves around Jack Dulaney, a down-and-out racetrack horse-walker who gets in a fight that lands him in jail. His buddy helps to spring him from a work gang, but is then killed. This is the catalyst for Jack's incredibly complicated search for the killer and reason behind the murder. The trail leads him to a New Jersey beach town and the radio station where his buddy used to work as an actor. There, further disappearances and deaths are revealed, including that of Carnahan, the father of the woman he pined for years before. As it happens, the woman is also in town, working as a nightclub singer under an assumed name. Jack manages to get work at the station as a writer, allowing him to poke around and try to get to the bottom of everything (not to mention rekindle his old flame).   Here is where the book starts to have real problems. Namely, all the detail about old-time radio production is far more fascinating than the murders. I'm not particularly (nor are most readers likely to be) interested in how dramatic radio shows were put together back in the '30s and '40s, but Dunning makes the station come alive and does a fascinating job of detailing the inner workings. From the scripting, to the management, the actors, the sound effects, it's all very well dramatized. So much so, in fact, that it's hard for the reader to care very much about the deaths of some characters met only very briefly or in flashbacks. The station's attempt to create original dramatic programming that pushed the limits of what was considered acceptable material--such as a scripted serial about black Americans, an anti-war prison camp series, and soforth--ends up being much more interesting. Unfortunately, the story eventually leaves the radio setting (via a lame piece of misdirection lifted from Hamlet) to dive into the world of German spies in America, the Irish Republic Army, and all manner of melodrama.  The melodrama is enhanced by a certain thinness to the characters. The protagonist is an especially poorly drawn hero figure with altogether too keen a resemblance to the hero of Dunning's "Bookman" series. He's one of those all-purpose strong, capable men. Street-fighting? No problem. Writing a critically well-received Steinbeck/Dos Passosesque novel? No problem. Escaping a work gang? No problem. Master writing radio drama overnight? No problem. Expert tracking through the woods? No problem. When the hero of a story turns out to be exceptional at everything, the whole story is diluted. Beyond Jack, the cast of characters is so large that Dunning doesn't really have the time or space to develop any of them in any meaningful way. It's not generally a good thing when the villain in a mystery is a character you can barely remember being in the story. This is a pity, because there are a number of characters with potential, and the old-time radio setting is certainly well done. As a historical novel about a small group of people striving in a creative field, it works fairly well--in no small part due to the subsequent total demise of the world depicted in the book. Just don't expect to pick this up and find yourself immersed in a thriller. 
 If you are into the old childrens songs from the 50's, 60's, and 70's (you know the ones: they were played by your kindergarten teacher on a record player)- then this set of 4 disks are for you. Personally, I was hoping for something a little more modern. These all sound like they were recorded directly from a 45LP. Not the highest quality 
 I have to agree with the previous poster.  This book just wasn't what I have grown to expect from Leigh.  I've read just about everything she's done and this is the first time I've walked away disappointed.  Anyone who knows of her August series would expect something of the same thing from her excerpt on her home page and from the back cover, sadly, there was none of that.  I fear that because Leigh is not writing under Ellora's Cave anymore that her books may continue to be toned down.  I do remember reading this book was pulled for revision last year.  I hope that is not the case, because her books are some of the best and hottest I've ever read.  However, if she continues to pull away from the less conventional I'm afraid she'll continue to disappoint some of her most loyal fans 
 Unbelievably complicated by totally useless information that is neither funny, relevant or useful.  It could be easily whittled down to 10 pages, and even then it would contain less info than the Tiger OS Owner's Manual.  Spend your $$$ on something else! 
 Half-hearted adaptation of Ernest Haycox novel is weak.  Scott is good as Owen; Knox is equally good as the baddie, but the film is missing movement.  If there were ever a Razzie award at the time, it would have to go to the  title song 
 Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.  Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals.  Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
 I spent all day yesterday reading "I'm Watching You," but I regret having done so.  First, there are way too many characters (about 20) to keep straight.  Second, [...]  Third, the last 20 pages wrap up everything very quickly, giving necessary background information which should have been incorporated more smoothly.  Fourth, Kristen (the heroine) is stupidly stubborn, insisting that the murderer "will not drive her out of her house."  [...]  No, Kristen will not leave.  (Nor apparently will she buy shades).  Even when she has to have a 24 hour police guard, plus the hero (and later, his father) keeping watch,  Kristen will not leave her house.  This stupid  contrivance exists just to put her in danger.  I got very tired of the many times that she fought off various people who wanted to kill her.  To complete her status as a character who is Too Stupid to Live, is her uninformed assumption about the seriousness of the effects of surgery.  (Yes, I bet you can figure the effect of this too).  A gifted artist who is now a dedicated, articulate, principled prosector never has this assumption verified, even fearing it will end her engagement to the hero?  Yeah, sure.  Yes, "I'm Watching You"  is a page turner, but I found it to be very unpleasant.  Even skipping the explicitly violent parts, I found this book increasingly nasty.  [... 
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 A big fan of Lehane, I was LOVING this book in the beginning, thinking to myself what a great choice I had made buyingit.It was interesting, funny, etc and seemed to be leading to a very compelling mystery to solve.  Midway thru the book, things got a bit vague as I was not able to figure out how some of the various happeneings connected with each other, but I was relieved when the 2 main charachters, Patrick and Angie, were also questioning the events themselves, not knowing what to make of them. Expecting things to come together from that point on and become a bit more focused, the plot got even more convoluted.  I continued reading  for the hell of it but I have finished the book and still not sure who was intended dead in the car "accident" (Trevor or his wife?) as well as who was really after who.When Jay Becker returned from Nantucket and knew Desiree was alive, Trevor then sent him to Florida to find her and kill her.  Why would Jay accept an assignment to kill? He was  one of the "good guys", right? In addition, a few holes were left in the plot (eg. when the "Weeble" and the chaffeur (I think his name was Cushing) were killed on the bridge in Florida, the police search reported they were residents of Atlanta ,(NOT employed by Trevor) and that their neighbors had seen the almost every day.  Yet earlier in the book the Weeble was definitely part of Trevors squad of cronies- this was never cleared up.. I was left quite frustrated by this book and because of it may never read Lehane again.  Anyone agree 
 The first book of this trilogy is the best. So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot. You know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story? There's a lot of "and then...and then and then...". Hope you get my drift. 
 These donuts were much heavier than typical donuts and sat at the bottom of my stomach.  Also the cream was a bit tasteless 
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 I found most of these recipes to be full of sugar and high fat ingredients.  I am by no means an extremist on the subject, but I just did not feel these meals were very healthy.  A better choice is Desperation Dinners, in my opinion 
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 I have a very good surround sound system, and my DD 5.1 DVDs, as well as Blue Man Group's "Complex" audio DVD, sound fantastic.  Alas, my DVD player doesn't support DVD-A, so I can't comment on that.  I can only say that the DD 5.0 track sounds like a CD.  There is no immersive feel to the mix, nor do the rear speakers make much of a contribution, even cranked all the way up.  There is sound there, but at best I hear muted, slightly time-delayed versions of the front speakers.  Sitting in the room's sweet spot, all the sound seems to come from the front, just like a CD.  I won't be buying any more of these unless a real DVD-A player makes a huge difference in the mix.  Artistically, the performance is good, but merely competent for musicians of this caliber, with little to distinguish it from a half-dozen other versions of the 7th I own.  Barenboim does make a few interesting choices in tempo and dynamics, which are sometimes interesting and sometimes distracting.  In summary, if you own a nice surround sound system but not a DVD-A player, and you're expecting to be amazed with a new, immersive, surround-sound listening experience, don't buy this product.  You'll be disappointed.  I know it's possible to create what I expected using DD 5.0, and I really wish someone would 
 Aslam's core story is fascinating - a culture clash that leads to the deaths of three people, and the collapse of a family. However, I found the book difficult to read for two reasons. The first was the visceral hatred thrown up on nearly every page towards Islam and the beliefs and attitudes held by first-generation Pakistani immigrants. Some of these beliefs are indefensible (such as honour killings and the fatal exorcism that appears in a subplot) but Aslam's seeming hatred of this culture - one he grew up in; he's the son of a Pakistani political exile - and Islam poisons any argument he was trying to make and makes this book a piece of anti-Islam and anti-Pakistani propaganda. The second difficulty with this book comes from Aslam's incredibly pretentious prose style (such as describing segments of an orange on a plate as "dolphins leaping over ocean waves"). Linked in with this is his failed stab at introducing magical realism (men with glowing hands and blood, peacocks and parakeets, fireflies becoming ghosts, men with golden hair), into the mix. The story that Aslam is trying to tell is the only reason why I have given this book two stars. If that hadn't been interesting, it would have just managed one. The difficulties Pakistani immigrants are facing in the UK, and elsewhere in the world, is a matter that deserves investigating and exploring in literature. But there are much better novels that explore these problems - Brick Lane by Monica Ali and Hanif Kureishi's excellent Buddha of Suburbia 
 I guess it depends on why you read this book, but if you want to know what to do in your home, don't waste your money on this one.  She does a good job of telling the history of Feng Shui and lots of little anecdotes about  the successful uses of it, but no good practical ways to use it for your  own benefit.  It didn't do a thing for me 
 This book has great content, but uses words and terms without defining making it very hard to follow. 
 A tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. That is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. My Accugage was reading 5 PSI high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. That's why I give it only one star 
 The plastic lip broke in several places while I was getting out of the bubble wrap.  I tried to salvage it, but the cardboard inside was so cheap I gave up and threw it out.  
 This book in not anywhere near Ms Brown's usual standards.  Lacklustre story based on an unbelievable premise.  Too bad 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 Harold Bloom, borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis, interprets the poet's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic Oedipal struggle, arguing that the ("belated") poet's literary productions result from a conflict with a "strong" father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the "repression" of his own poetic self and the strong misreading (or "misprision", as Bloom calls it) of the work of a predecessor. Bloom's conception of the "canon" is a hierarchical, continuous and genealogical model of direct succession, as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities, ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency, opening his text to the strong aura of the canon, and testing his productions against it. However, Bloom's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence, belatedness and originality, and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously. This admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial. Another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of "influence" and "tradition" can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness, for the poet cannot be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching. Bloom's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents, and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works, reflects the postmodern "fin-de-millennium" langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted, and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works, but merely repeat the past. Not only are his conclusions totally untenable, but his whole treatise, on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents, fails to provide for a more dynamic, more forward-moving (as opposed to reversing, revising and troping) theory of poetry, a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully. It would be interesting to discover what Bloom would make of Henry Adams's remark: "Everything is respectable and nothing amusing. There are no outlaws. 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 I have never come across such blatant hostility towards Christianity  - and in a children's book to boot!  The research is inaccurate and the writing poor.  For example, the author writes about Prince Henry, "He was religious enough...." and then continues on to, yet again, put Christians in a tiny, mindless box.  What does it mean to be "religious enough"?  Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this book 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 I really wanted this book to work.  It seemed to have all the right elements; history, Nazis, action, art and romance.  Ultimately it was too mechanical.  This was Berry's first novel and it was obviously very well-researched.  Maybe his next attempt will be more finished.   THE AMBER ROOM is like a painted room with no curtains.  There's just something missing. 
 Sue Monk Kidd was raised in the conservative South; she went to charm school; several of the men in her family are Baptist ministers; and, for many years, she earned a living as an inspirational Christian writer (get the picture?).  For most of her adult life, Kidd never questioned her faith or her femininity ... that is, not until she witnessed an episode of sexual harassment involving her teenage daughter.  Following this incident, Kidd gradually began to realize that the Church and society are patriarchal systems.  The first part of this book deals with Kidd's spiritual/feminist awakening, while the second part of this book deals with her evolving faith.  While I have a lot of respect for Kidd's willingness to question herself and her deepest beliefs, her book was of virtually no use to me.    I think my background has a lot to do with my disinterest.  I'm a good 20 years younger than Kidd, and I've considered myself a "feminist" since I was about 2 years old.  So - all of these bright ideas that Kidd was having - they really go without saying for me.  I mean - her realizations that women are not second to men and that we have been "socialized" to believe certain things about gender ... well, these are notions that have been explored and re-explored about a zillion times.  Anyone with even a remote understanding of feminist theory is going to be really bored by the first half of this book, which is primarily devoted to her not-so-profound awakening.  With that said - if you are not very well-versed in feminism, or if you come from a really conservative background (like Kidd) - her awakening might be of interest to you.  Personally, I found the second half of the book a bit more interesting, as Kidd talked occasionally about the history of Christianity and the history of women in the Church; I definitely learned some new things.  However, I imagine that there are more useful books that explore the history of women and Christianity.  Unfortunately, I do not know of any at this time.  There are 3 additional complaints I have with this book:     1.  Kidd overuses metaphors!  Don't get me wrong.  It's not that I'm not a "poetic" type (I was an English major in college) - it's just that she uses metaphors to the point that they become tedious.  This book should have been edited a bit more carefully.      2.  Throughout this text, Kidd frequently describes her dreams.  I find this really frustrating, because her "dreams" are so evidently contrived.  Does anyone really believe that Kidd had a dream in which she crawled into the empty lap of a Pieta-like statue, and that the Virgin healed her wounds?  All of her so-called dreams are *uncannily* relevant to her spiritual journey.  I felt manipulated each time I read about one.         3.  She talks a lot about the Devine Feminine and uses a lot of female language.  That's great.  I think it's really important that Christians counter the always-male descriptions of the Divine (i.e. God, Father, He, etc.).  However, Kidd also talks frequently about the "feminine soul."  I think it's dangerous to assign a specifically "feminine" soul to all women; this implies that there is something inherently "feminine" about women and their spirituality and something inherently "masculine" about men and their spirituality.  Does this not counter the very idea that women are *socialized* to be feminine and men are *socialized* to be masculine?  I think it does.  And - along those same lines - Kidd frequently describes specifically feminine rituals or moments of feminine worship.  Almost every time, these rituals and moments of worship have to do with nature - or maybe with spontaneous dancing or singing.  It seemed to me that she was describing women as somehow more "natural" and "earthly" than men.  This is certainly not a new idea.  For centuries, women have been associated with the earth and base instincts, while men have been associated with the divine and more spiritual and intellectual pursuits.  And while I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to bring the earth and nature back into Christianity - I think Kidd is making a big mistake in her implication that women, specifically, are connected to the earth.   In summary - if you are in a situation similar to the situation Kidd was in when she had her awakening and would like to learn more about a woman's spiritual/feminist journey - this would be an okay book for you (though I really only recommend it half-heartedly).  But, if you already have a general understanding of feminism - or if you are put off by the notion that women are "earthly" - I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I have to admit that I love this set. Especially since I found it hard to find white flannel sheets. Most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen! So when I found these and at this price I was quite happy. They feel great, not the best flannel but nice all the same. But after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore. Later the fitted started getting holes. So since this was rather cheap I am not horribly sad about it. So if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning, this is the set for you 
 THIS MOVIE IS STUPID I SHOULD KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FOOLS WHO BROUGHT THIS PIECE OF TRASH DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEAPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS MOVIE IS GREAT THE MOVIE IS A HOME VIDEO THATS ALL IT IS I SUGGEST YOU READ A REAVIEW ON A SEARCH INGIN 
 *WARNING!!! This critique contains major spoilers!*  Sometimes I wonder if I read a different book than everyone else, that just happens to have the same title.  Everybody seems to love this book, but I really hated it. The basic story idea was good enough, but the ending came off to me as a cop out because Dekker just couldn't thing of anything else to write. Also, am I the only one who noticed the big plot hole that the ending created?  The girl that turned out to be a figment of the main guy's imagination, was in earlier parts of the story, without him, conversing with other characters.  How can a figment of one man's imagination be so involved with other people?  That just really bugged me. Now on to the cheesy, cheesy, freaking cheesy dialog. My pet peeve in any book or movie is cheesy dialog. I can't stand it. First of all, let me say, I think it's wonderful that this guy doesn't use profanity. But what was with the ridiculous insults he used in place of the curse words. If you don't want to call someone a $^!/head, God bless you, but come on "toilet water," "squat."  Jerk would have worked just fine.  Or, who says that you have to use any insults at all. Bottom line, I thought this book was really stupid, and because of it, I am very hesitant to ever read anything else written by Ted Dekker.  I'll just read John Grisham, and mark over the swear words with a sharpie 
 Tried very hard to get through this book, but in the end gave up.  Don't need a paragraph to describe a blade of grass.  Put me to sleep 
 I gave up on this DVD about 5 minutes in. It moves SO fast, if you have no prior knowledge of pilates you'll find yourself going "What? How? What do I..?"    I haven't tried pilates before and was really looking forward to this DVD, but with Hessell bolting through "Breathe in 2-3-4, out 2-3-4, now bring your knees up to your abdomen, move your hands down, breathe out and do this, do that..." at a million miles a minute I had to give it up 
 Even though I am very careful with how I use and store my pots and pans the exterior of this set scratches very easity due to normal use. I store my set in a deep drawer in my new kitchen and removing and replacing these causes the scratches. I am very disappointed in the poor exterior finish and how badly this set looks. I would not buy this set again. I sent a pot back to Meyer for their inspection and am waiting to hear from them. I will probably replace this  set very soon, but not with another Anolon product 
 It is apparent that the first premise in Peck's book is that in order for humans to be a whole being, one must grow through spirituality (or enlightenment) attained through "grace" with the main purposes of gaining "capacity and understanding of serendipity" (309) and through "spiritual evolution, whereby people grow towards godhood" (270) and "become God" (283).    The second premise is that if a person is to be a complete being, one must possess a certain amount of "freedom" and grow in the capacity of love.  Freedom can be through several avenues such as sexual "self-expression and exploration" (147).    Peck's premises are secular in nature, mainly concentrating on one's self.  He confuses the true God with a man-made form of a god.  Peck instructs readers not to conform to a particular religion, but inundates them with own "religion," which is a mixture of pseudo-Christian philosophies, Eastern mysticism, and post-modern thoughts.  One of the ways he does this is by quoting Bible verses out of context.    Peck's version of love is a free-for-all deficient of morality and decency.  Sexual intimacy is devoid of commitment through a covenant marriage, and reduces it to a spontaneous animalistic act.  In fact, love is his excuse for sexual transgression of the therapist-client relationship.    It is a sad situation in our society when Peck's book becomes a bestseller.  A "road less traveled" offers what the general population desires to hear: find your own way and do as you please.  
 So soo buggy.  I was looking forward to this game for months, only to buy it and discover it was a bugged unplayable mess.  The reason for this is that the game is simply a reskined copy of their sea dogs 2 game that they released in 2003 as pirates of the carribean.  If you dig into the game files you can even find remnants of code referencing locations and objects from that game that aren't in this game any longer.  So really this game is just a retexturing of that game, with a bunch of unnecessary code left in that leads to a bunch of bugged coding that runs into problems at every turn 
 I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could 
 This is honestly the worst audio book I have ever bought.  Kenneth Davis has written some fantastic books, unfortunately this is not one of them.  I can't even sell this as used.  I could not bring myself to do something that bad to another human.  Kenneths other books are funny, interesting, and informative.  This book would have been better at all three if it had been a random collection of words. 
 Like Forrester and O'Brian before her, Pamela Allen uses factual accounts of H.M Royal Navy during the age before steam to flesh out the bones of her fictional characters. Sadly, the flesh is meagre and quickly becomes a bloated bloodless corpse becalmed in a sea of ennui.   Too often we see young childrens' book writers tackle great themes only to founder in their own syntax. Sadly, there are no great themes here, and Ms. Allen is not a young writer but an aged academic who has spent too much time in libraries and not enough on the Main, hoisting herself through the lubber's-hole over the futtock shrouds.   Tales of Adventure on the high seas this ain't. Rather, a prolix insight into one man's wasted life in the cafeterias and chat-rooms of an East-Anglian polytechnic. Without any malice I would suggest the author make a sea-change and open a video shop 
 I'm an attorney with many years' experience in the venture capital area. The content of the book tends to reflect East Coast practice more than West Coast (Silicon Valley) practice. That's not necessarily a flaw, but you should be aware that the styles can differ in some respects.  The style of writing though, is my major complaint about this book. In a word, it's pompous. Too many sentences have very complex, passive or impersonal constructions. Paragraphs are long and dense, without any concern for the reader's fatigue level.   Also, some quantitative concepts could have been much more clearly expressed with a simple formula (high school-level math). The discussion of weighted average antidilution protection at pp. 90-91 is a case in point. I found this impossible to understand when I first read it. The more I read it, the more obscure it became to me. It could have been described much more accurately, and in many fewer lines, with a simple fraction.  Clear communication didn't seem to be a priority for this author. 
 It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather.  It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.    This "book", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum.  If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts.  BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 In the dusty California town of Hard Pan, Lucky is searching desperately for something to believe in, her Higher Power. Having lost her mother in a horrifying accident, Lucky is now raised by her "guardian" Brigitte, as her father was not up for the job. Lucky fears that Brigitte (Bree-JEET, not BRIDGE-it) is planning on abandoning her to return home to France. With her survival kit in tact, Lucky plans an escape of her own into the desert, hoping the town of Hard Pan comes to realize what they've lost.  There's so much I could say about this book because there's just so much that doesn't make sense. For instance, why would a woman like Brigitte ever agree to fly to America and raise a child that isn't hers, that's her ex-husband's? Why in a town of only 43 (well, actually 42) people are there AA meetings for every sort of addiction known to man? Things that are supposed to seem interesting and unique have a tendency to come off boring and often times, forced in this book. I just didn't find any of it as special or meaningful as the author would've liked me to.  My biggest problem with the book is that Patron's voice is too scattered. It's not clear who she's writing this for. Lucky is nine years old, the same age as the fifth graders I teach, however a lot of the subject matter discussed in this book would mean nothing to them. At times Patron tries to write and sound like a nine year old, but she has difficulty making this believable because Lucky doesn't think and talk like a normal nine year old. It seemed to me that Patron was trying too hard to write how a child would write and this effort didn't carry evenly throughout the book. To be quite honest, it doesn't work and I think most children Lucky's age that pick up this book, will end up putting it down out of boredom.  There were a few things I didn't hate though. Lucky has a list of "good mother" qualities and "bad mother qualities". This list was adorably touching and heart wrenchingly sad at the same time. I lightly chuckled when Lucky, who wants badly to run away, can only think of places in Hard Pan to hide. She doesn't know how to actually "leave" Hard Pan and like the previous example, it's funny but somehow sad at the same time. Matt Phelan's subtle pencil drawings add a lot to the story as well. Cute as these scenes were, I just couldn't escape the fact that this book is flat out boring most of the way through.  Maybe I didn't read between the lines enough. Maybe I'm nit-picking. Maybe the things I just couldn't get over really aren't that important when telling the story. But don't we have the right to be a little nit-picky when we're talking about the Newbery Award winner? This is the book that is supposed to stand above all other children's books in a given year and I found it incredibly dull. I continue to be disappointed in the Newbery Honor and Medal books year in and year out. They've lost touch with who these books are supposed to be written for and most of the time, I'm left scratching my head.  Now let's get this straight, I don't like to write negative reviews. I don't get a thrill out of tearing down someone else's hard work. However, I happen to believe that a bad or negative review, is better than no review. It's in all fairness to the author, Susan Patron, that I write this, whether she or anyone else cares to read it or not. I guess I wouldn't have disliked this book as much as I did if it wouldn't have won the Newbery, but when a title has that shiny medal gracing its cover, it better darn well live up to the hype. Sorry folks, this one didn't 
 this movie sucks. ending is predictable. the line about being as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton was ALMOST good. Reservoir Dogs--now there's a heist film 
 I bought this for the little things, and for that it works- as long as it doesn't take you more than about 3-4 minutes to clean up.  The battery on this thing sucks.  It takes a long time to get a full charge and a full charge means only about 4 minutes of battery usage. Save yourself the frustration and spend the extra few dollars to get a higher quality vacuum 
 This item is not good and does not deliver what it promises. It has no power and could not suck the air out of the bags. I was very disappointed and would not recommend buying this product. Spend a few extra dollars and buy something different, you'll be disappointed too if you dont 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 I am quite shocked to see so many good reviews of this book. My son just received this as a gift. It was awful. The use of "dino" in front of almost every term is annoying. The story line isn't that great and the 2 page spread of dinosaurs spewing green vomit larger than the boat is completely gross and not appropriate. I'm pretty open minded, but my toddler really doesn't need a book like this 
 Philosophers should enjoy this one.  The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions.  This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry.  Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter.  From there, the story lost steam 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 There is no reason to inflict this text on yourself. If you are looking for a primer, or at least a solid piercing of the semiological membrane, there are far superior works, such as the wonderful Semiology: The Basics by Daniel Chandler or Structural Poetics by Culler. This book, it seems to me, was meant as a fast and loose refrence for a class or a seminar: it rarely defines its terms, it seems disorganized and it is very dry, just listing method without any reason why one should be interested. The other two books, in particular Basics, were written long after Elements and thus are much more incompassing, including theory and practice, and Basics by Chandler even has a glossary at the back. Bartes may be the man, but this is definitly not the book; but, if your a Bartes completist, already well initiated into the world of Semiology and Structuralism, then by all means pick it up. Anyone else, steer clear 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 I would lie if I say that I saw Titus or heard the soundtrack (I take it it's true that some songs were copies ), but what I was frustrated is that I heard a totally ripped traditional macedonian song called "Zajdi,zajdi jasno sonce", here disguised as the 24th title - " Message for the queen ". Hmmm, I wonder how Tyler gets his "inspirations".. 
 bad dialogue, bad scenario, unrealistic plot and absolutely impossible crimes, funny characters, comic judge and police force, bad writing, bad almost everything. can't imagine this is a popular writer who has won some awards. simply trerrible. have read thrillers and mysteries for over 30 years, this is one of the worst. how could it be with such high praises is beyond me. enjoy if you could but spare me with mercy 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 This small book (a bit expensive at 25 bucks) has some interesting things to say about location and economic activity (though I wished there would have been more on the way of examples). It is surprising, though, that Krugman never mentions one reason why labor mobility it's not (and, in all probability, will never be) as high in the European Union as it is in the United States: the fact that European workers speak different languages (OK, many speak english, but many don't, and one almost surely is bound to be less good working in a second language than in a native one) 
   The core concept of teaching Windows Script Host (WSH) and VBScript through the creation of simple games is solid. But the execution is awful.    Ultimately you should know both WSH and VBScript to be an effective scripter. But author Ford takes you on a tour of the WSH object model before he actually introduces VBScript. He lays out table after table of WSH objects, methods and properties without any real explanation, just the caveat that you'll learn more later. Great technique: confuse the student first, explain later.    The early example scripts are direct lifts from the Microsoft TechNet Script Center. Worse yet, Ford makes mistakes in his description of the WSH objects - and there is no errata on the web site.    Ford spends 62 confusing to the beginner pages on WSH before he gets to VBScript basics. This makes no sense to me. What makes this section entirely laughable, however, is that at its end, Ford "challenges" the reader to make modifications to the sample programs. He has explained absolutely nothing that would assist the neophyte scripter in making these changes. In fact, Ford has said precious little about any WSH specifics.    When Ford finally reaches "VBScript basics" he immediately repeats the mistakes of his WSH chapter: 124 tables listing VBScript objects, methods, properties and other information are introduced . . . without detailed explanation. Ford essentially describes his sample scripts in the manner of "Line 1 says . . ." and then repeats, verbatim, Line 1 without necessarily explaining just what Line 1 does.    Finally Ford should have taken more care to separate his instructions each of the technologies. Literally by combining WSH and VBScript "for the absolute beginner," he is putting far too much on the plate of said beginner - and Ford is not capable of keeping things simple, much less explaining them.    This is defintitely not a book I would recommend for a beginner. And since it never attempts going significantly beyond the most basic concepts, it isn't suitable for more experienced scripters or programmers either. Frankly I wish I had gotten into the book much earlier when I could still have returned it. My copy is headed toward a rummage sale somewhere. Obviously my impression of Thomson Course Technology's "for the absolute beginner" is negative and I won't be considering any others in the series.  Jerr 
 Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid 
 This game is one hot mess.  I bought it for my Mom for Christmas.  We decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun.  Well, the word my Mother used to describe it is "EXCRUCIATING".  This was the slowest and most boring thing I've ever played.  There is at least a 10 second pause between EACH function (choosing a case, opening the case, Howie giving you directions, taking turns, looking at your opened case. . .you name it).  Each time you switch back to the other player, THE SCREEN LITERALLY GOES BLACK!  You only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end.  When a case is opened, you only see two arms, breasts and the case!  When it is your turn to pick a case, there is COMPLETE SILENCE as you scroll - and I use the term loosely - up and down to pick a number.  For a "video game" which you assume to move quickly, you'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it.  You will be exhausted when you're through.  We suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses, play some theme music when you are choosing your case, show the girl who opens your case, have the audience clap - ANYTHING!!!!!!!!  If you buy this game, you only have yourself to blame. P.S.  I won $750,000 and didn't even care, I was just glad it was over 
 Seemed like it was probably early in Yuen Baio's career. The fighting was very slow paced and measured... The story was pretty decent I guess, but the acting was really bad. That being said, the story really isn't capable of driving this movie. If you put the fights in fast forward it's a good watch 
 If you believe Britain made what Africa is today than this is the book for you. Pakenham portrays the scramble for Africa as a two-player game between Britain and France, with little attention being paid to the portuguese, german, italian or spanish presence and interests in the continent. As a result, Pakenham's book is really a book about the British scramble for Africa, neglecting some of the most curious cultural and political aspects of the heterogeneous european presence in Africa. Focused in Britain, Pakenham also misses the opportunity to explore the reaction of african cultures to colonial advances and the position of independent african states. It is therefore a rather poor book and one in which prejudice against other european colonial powers is too often evident 
 If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.    There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.  There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.    If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.   
 I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort. 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 Suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to Rabbi David Berger's book , The Rebbe , the Messiah & the Scandal of Orthodox indifference  
 the trouble with this DVD is that it is too fast, too brief and with no real outline of pilates for 'everyone' as the title implies. This is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new. However I found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me. I like to do my pilates slowly, and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly.  There is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises. There was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives, but it is all done during the exercises, so it is of little use. It is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core, and anchor yourself to the floor. It is definitely a quick once over.  I enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this, but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates. There are some very good books which can get your started, I loved Brooke Siler's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives. 
 This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book 
 I bought the book because recently I have been into the personal mastery thing like increasing your memory, reading better, and so on.  Before I bought the book, I read the preface, and the the promises in it did not deliver.  Before I go on I assure you that unlike some reviewers I read this 390 some pages of this book.  This is definitely one of those books that Mortimor Adler in their book "How to Read a Book" describes as books that should challege you.  And quite a challenge it is.  Frances Yates assumes that the reader have knowledge of many things.  Like foriegn languages such as Latin, Italian, this book is rife with it and most of it untranslated.  Frances Yates also assumes that the reader know of various philosophical idiosycrasies of the known history of man.   The title of the book suggest that it is a book about the history of the art of memory and it is not.  I agree with the earlier review of hglee of Avoldone Estates in GA. Definitely pass on this one and move on and forget the title of the book 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 Though I respected Allan Bloom's translation and introduction to Rousseau's "Emile", "The Closing of the American Mind" shows his inadequacy as a social theorist as well as an academic.  The worthy, though somewhat obvious, point here is Bloom's recognition of America's movement away from intellectualism.  Ironically, this work filled with tenuous arguements makes a case that intellectuals (if one considers Bloom this) have very little to offer (and may be incapable of understanding) society. His comments on music, culture, and race are embarrassingly naive and insipid.  One of the more glaring deficiencies here was the treatment of German philosophy; I don't know that there is a notable scholar who has more misunderstood Nietzsche than Bloom.  He should stick to translating French and leave interpretation up to more worthy critics.    
 This memoir was painful.  Painful in a "oh my God, could it get any worse?".    Boring, mundane, cold, flatlined.  It feels as though the author is emotionless and it got to a point where I just felt like shaking her and saying "oh enough already".    Sincerely, just pass this one buy.  Not even worth a library visit.  
 Huggins is a hippocrite and writes a book that is completely irresponsible. This book does little to provide guidance to a new nursing mom. Rather it makes you feel guilty, helpless and like a failure. I was a successful nursing mom for 14 months despite this book. For the birth of my second child, I did myself a favor and used it for a coaster for my water cup while I nursed my baby.   Do yourself a favor and get the AAP or the Good Housekeeping books instead 
 DONT BUY THIS GUITAR IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.i love guitars i rarely ever put mine done.but when i saw this guitar, it looks ok but it plays like a guitar made out of rubber bands. it is not worth the money.my advice invest a little more money in a guitar that is made better. You can also find it on this site it is the berringer v-tone guitar.IT IS A GREAT GUITAR FOR ANY STYLE OF PLAY AND ANY LEVEL OF PLAYER.this was my first guita 
 Taylor Hicks:  Perseverance - Yes.  Hard work - Maybe. Musical talent -  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  It's funny how people perceive music.  It's even funnier to see how people cast their votes in a talent contest as if they were voting for a political candidate or something. Hicks might represent all those virtues flag wavers love to preach about.  But that says NOTHING about his abilities as a musical performer.  I guess if you don't have an ear for music, you need something else to go on.  As far as this CD goes, I'll just say it's no better or no worst than all the other contrived American Idol productions.  It's kinda like another great American tradition: the McDonald's cheese burger - just another "run of the grill" 
 All homeschool books that are hardcore Christian need a warning label - right on the front cover and probably on every page too.    Meaningful church involvement is a necessary ingredient for homeschool success?  I have to have a biblical conviction that God has called me to homeschool?    I guess I have to forget about homeschooling then, since neither of those apply to me.  Then she gets into curriculum and tells you to save yourself some time and settle on a traditional curriculum (if I wanted a traditional curriculum I might as well leave my kid in public school) designed for Christian or public school use.  That's great if you want a traditional curriculum.  But there are FAR more curricula out there than the Christian and traditional curricula she suggests.  And a great many kids have been successfully homeschooled using other than the "traditional" method.  Seems like she could at least have mentioned that fact.  On the last page I read before I could read no more, (which was about a third of the way in), she notes that instead of attempting to meet any state-mandated objectives, one should strive to realize God-given directives.  However let me warn you - if your state requires certain criteria such as standardized testing that you fail to do since it was not a divine directive, be sure to get a lawyer because the state will take you to court.  If she had only titled this book The Ultimate Guide to Christian Homeschooling, I think it would have been great.  All of us non-Christians would have avoided it and Christian homeschoolers would probably get a lot out of it.  There is a tremendous amount of information in it that is of value - if you approach it from a hardcore Christian point of view.  But if you DO NOT believe (as I DO NOT) that children are in desperate need of training if they are to grow up to bow their knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then give this book a pass 
 I also bought this system primarily for the Bose name and quality, it did sound much better and deeper in the store, it was easy to hook up and at first was impressed by the ease of use and sound, but then I started experiencing problems with the unit freezing during movies.  the only way to get it to play again is to unplug the unit from the wall and "reboot" and then spend 10 minutes trying to get back to the place you left off.  After reading some other reviews about the 321 system, I see that this is a common problem.  It will freeze on some movies and not at all on others, it makes no sense whatsoever.  I also own movies in my DVD collection that it refuses to play at all, but will play fine on my 8 year old Pioneer DVD system.  I am not satisfied with this system at all and consider it way over priced for performance and craftsmanship.  I will replace this unit next year, but it will not be a Bose.  Stick with the speakers from Bose, not the electronics.  Lesson learned 
 This memoir/humor type book was written by a former employee of Amazon.com.  While the author proclaims himself to be a slacker (read: cool) I thought this story would be quite entertaining.  WRONG!  I did manage to get through the book (it was no easy feat) and throughout the whole thing, the author manages to write and write but actually says absolutely nothing.  It is obvious that the author used this book as nothing more than a vehicle to wax poetic.  I did not gleam one piece of interesting information out of this memoir.  The book is purported to be funny when, in fact, it is a one great big yawn.   An incredibly boring read.  Now I know why I found this book on the "sale" table at my local bookstore 
 I recently attended the Ashes and Snow exhibition in New York. The show was good,if a bit reptative. Its location, The Noamadic Museum is an engineering marvel and seems more like a gothic cathedral  than shipping containers (Frankly seeing the photos in the building is a truly awesome esperience). After the show I went to book store to pick up the catalog and found it was selling on site for $130. This is way way too much money for what you're getting. Like all of the materials for sale connected to the exhibit you're paying for the presentation rather than the pictures themselves, all of which are reproduced in a much too small size. What you're paying for is the binding and while the binding might, with some better interior material, be worth $130 or more, here its simply a major rip off. Gregory Colbert has those of us who like his work over a barrel and he's going to squeeze every last penny from us. While I do like the images, I can not recommend anyone buying the catalog, or any other material connected with the show, at the wildly inflated prices they are asking.  Go see the show instead, its only twelve bucks and you get to see the glorious space they've built to house it 
 I'm sorry, but this is elevator muzak pure and simple. I bought 'Letter From Home' in 1989 aged 16 and it sounded dated even then. I'm absolutely horrified that some reviewers imagine this to be a jazz album. It isn't. It's bland, facile rubbish. Buy John Abercrombie's 'November' and find out what a real six-stringer can do in the name of jazz 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 This book is thinner than a magazine and geared toward married couples who will be apart for a period of time.  I don't see this book geared toward a true long distance relationship where a couple is not married.  Some ideas are good, but overall, this book is pretty stupid and a waste of money 
 (First of all, this is coming from a huge [Christian] fan of the HP books.) While some of his points do make since, most are not sufficiently explained, and are therefore unbelieveable.  Killinger makes a lot of glaring mistakes; for example, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of a dementor other than the fact that it can (can being the main word) suck out one's soul.  He also gives quite a few incorrect discriptions of exact events in the books.  (An example:  He said that Hagrid had turned Vernon Dursley to a pig in Sorcerer's Stone, but he actually gave DUDLEY Dursley a pig's TAIL.)  The one crucial point that I think he has actually brought across is the role of good vs. evil in the series. Overall, if you are a person who is looking to see if the series is appropriote for you or your children, buy this book.  Otherwise, if you are a fan looking for a good defence of the books, don't waste your time 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
    The entire book could have been distilled down to one or two useful pages.   A typical example of the author's predilection to stating the obvious in expert-speak:  "Generally children will send discernible non-verbal signals when they are ready to end a conversation with an adult. They often begin to stare off into space or become silly. It is time to end the exchange."      And then there are the self-promoting anecdotes such as, "It is encouraging to meet alumni from the 90's who had been exposed to intense social skill instruction during their high school years. Their conversational entrees are far more appropriate and effective: 'How are Mrs. Lavoie, Christian, Danny and Meggi?' 'How long will you be in the area?' 'How are things on Cape Cod?'"      If you can bring yourself to wade through the superfluous chit chat and you've never read anything on this subject before, it may be worth buying used 
 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 Briefly looking through this book you can quickly see that it is not a technical design book.   It does a very nice job at praising various popular magazines, and it does highlight fundamental design practices within magazine design.  It is a good overview book. It is also a good book to see many images of successful magazines without having to hunt down various magazines.  However, the problem is the book does not going into the technical process of magazine layout. Magazine layout IS a very technical process that most books don't explain. There is much about the grid - it is extremely important and very under estimated. It is also more simple than most people would think. There is also much about magazine layout and structure this book will not cover. Also about the whole process, from layout to print. There are a MILLION questions and problems that pop-up while designing a magazine. Many considerations and variables that vary. This book does not bring up any of those.  Can you design a magazine after reading this book? No. Can you evaluate and understand magazines better after reading this book? Yes. Can you get a feeling for what magazine design is about after reading this book? Yes. Can you get some great ideas out of this book? Yes. ...you can also get them by looking through quality magazines 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 This album appears to represent an obscure sub-segment of drum'n'bass. A stripped down, aural desert of only drums. They are skillful, original drums, but they have nothing to accompany. Aside from the distant echoeing atmospherics, all you get on this album is one long drum solo. This may be just right for a minute sub-segment of the d'n'b listening community, but for me it lacks 
 I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review.  This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel.  This guy went to Harvard?  It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker.  The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid.  It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on?  Maybe they went to Harvard, too).  Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than "making love."  We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words.  Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters.  Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la "Mystery Science Theater 3000", perhaps).  This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel 
 I typically loved historical novels but this one was a snoozer. Totally uneventful until the end--and then bad things happen to the only characters you can actually like! The constant change of voice was too choppy 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 I recently purchased this book on Amazon and dug in. The technology does not get in the way of the message and the author has a light humor which makes the learing process go faster. Incidentally, I had a question so I left an email for the author, and got a personal response the next day, clearing up my question. I recomend this book and other titles written by this person 
 I am a huge fan of both Leann Banks and Janet Evanovich....and actually I have purchased everything written by both authors.  However, this one should have stayed on the "drawing board" for an "OVER-HAUL" before it was published!!    Best wishes to both and I will still buy all of your books....but this one STINKS!! 
 If you wish you had models to pose for you in strange and unnatural poses, this is the book for you.  But if you were hoping for natural poses (woman sitting in chair, man walking, woman climbing stairs, man throwing ball, woman picking up object from floor, that type of thing) that you might use in illustrations, you, like I, would be sadly disappointed.  I'm returning it 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 If you are looking for a book with a lot of nice pictures, then this would be for you. If you are looking for a book to learn the technique of close up photography, this is the wrong book. The book is 80% pictures and only has very basic information on close up photography. Not a good source to learn from.

 What can you call a woman with a Bryn Mawr education who makes fun of a 10th grade drop out from the south because he, like about half of the other people from his socio-economic background, mispronounces the word "ask" as "axe"...?   An arrogant idiot!  And one who knowingly and for profit perpetrated an indelible stain on an American tragedy, and further muddied the waters for future researchers.  And unlike contemporary audiences of this unfortunate work, the modern reader now has access to the knowledge that both McMillian and her husband have been exposed as known CIA assets and propagandists.  This book is a good way to waste 6-8 hours of your life that you can never get back, is based on what the writer knew to be bald-faced lies, and is presented in an insultingly smug manner.   This book isn't worth the matches it would take to set it on fire. 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 I ordered 2 of these 2-quart saucepans because I had owned them and liked them in the past.  I only threw them out after letting them boil dry and turn into molten lava.  The pans that I bought in September 2005 were manufactured in China and did not measure up to the past quality of those made in the USA and Korea.  The interiors are oddly rough and the knob on the top of one of the covers has a sharp edge.  These pans are worth the $15.33 I paid for each of them and not a penny more 
 I was assigned to read this book for social religion class. I did not find it very interesting to read. most of the stories are business stereotype. The book itself is very confusing. It seems that it keeps repeating itself- over and over 
 Just received this, Knowing that it was a low end unit,  I didnt expect much,  for the price I guess they are ok,  there was alot of feedback when moving the connector plugged into the unit, might be a short in the plug somewhere,  so for that reason It lost a star.  I am sure there are better Headphones for the same money 
 horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al 
 This is a joke.  It has too much uninspired music from Browne's later albums, and leaves out classics like "That Girl Could Sing."  Sadly, there are no decent collections of Jackson Browne's music yet released, and fans will still have to get all of his great albums separately and make their own collections.    From other reviews, I gather that rock snobs are frustrated by the album's omission of "obscure gems."  And people like me who just want to hear the great songs we grew up with are equally disappointed.  
 I am a big fan of tike as well and thought that this set would be perfect first train for my daughter who is 22 months and later my baby who is now 5 months...  Also before I made the decision of buying this, not only I looked around, but also read the reviews and bought it based on the ratings of this product.   Tikes has the reputation of making toys targeted to toddlers, but this thing is boring, DOES come off the rails when making the turn, we have to keep putting it back; you try to put the driver and the train just goes off; and to make it worst it stops after one round, so that when the kids are getting the hang of it and are ready to watch, it has to be started again...  The only good thing is that it is portable by just folding it, and that is what I am doing: I am folding it and taking this thing back to where it came from.. 
 This movie is painful to watch. I love indie films and gay and lesbian films.. but this movie is a shade better than a home movie.. the cinematography is decent, but the acting is terrible and the audio sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom... everyone delivers their lines like they're reading them right off a cue card.. their timing and delivery is horrible... the actors have no life and their on camera presence is lifeless and boring. The dialog seems like it was written halfway and the actors were asked to improvise the rest. As I said before, the poor sound quality would be distracting if there weren't so many other bad things going on. The "looks" of the actors  are mediocre, so there really isn't eye candy to make up for everything else bad in this movie... definitely not worth wasting money or time on 
 This is a very nice coffee table book, and for a beginning art novice there are some "secrets". But, for artist with general high school level education this is little more than a nice picture book.  	There is no discounting Yves Lanthier's skill or excellent creative ability but the few tips he gives are not for creating the Trompe L'oeil ceilings he exhibits in the book. Rather he shows simple stone / marble technique, a basic wall effect and basic light shading in the last fifteen pages of the book. 	This is not a book the speaks to basic line and eye illusion of ceiling depth which I was looking for. 
 did not work - never clicked no tech support waste of good mone 
 well I buyed this one, and I have to say I lost a bit of money. the author knows very little of what he is talking about, and that little that he knows he is not able to explain in a usefull way. Plus all the book is focused on a hand-made web application that has NOTHING to do with real world scenarios. Do yourself a nice thing and look around for something better. Some usefull info can be found here only for people that are beginners with browsers usage 
 Don't get me wrong.. I got sucked in by Daylight too.. but the fact is.. Aesop Rock is NOT Canibus. His lyrics DO NOT make sense.. his lyrics have never made any cohesive sense for more than two bars at a time.  The only songs even remotely worth keeping on this album are No Regrets, which is actually surprisingly well written, the excellent Daylight, and 9-5er's Anthem which is also average.  Check out Bazooka Tooth, it's Aesop's most well-produced and written album 
 I think that if this had not been written by Andrew Holleran, it would not have been published.  It is not so much a novel as a collection of "thoughts" that are fairly sophmoric, if not trite.  I tried to finish it, but it kept on putting me to sleep.  I'd try this book instead of Ambien 
 I just purchased this board on sale for 44.99.  not at all worth the purchase.  board looks aged and faded.  would not recommend 
 Wood/water is without a shadow of a doubt the worst record i have ever picked up for a start the lead vocalist seems to be whinging like something you would hear on a dashboard confessional or even new found glory album although having said that this album deserves the title 'emo' with the genre been the worst around and anyone who deserves that title has got to be (weak), i've heard all the albums from the promise rings discography excpecting to hear an improvment every time but the only cd i half like is nothing feels good and even that has the repetative sound from this very poor band, you could pick up a guitar and learn to play it in about 2 months and you would be as talanted as the guitarist from this band, i would advise that you try and hear samples of this band to get a slight reflection of how terrible they are. Alot of the bands who have been on jade tree (although it's epitaph in this case) are terrible with the slight exception of Jets to Brazil (later albums included despite non-stop cynical remarks) and j church (probably one of the most under-rated bands around). Wood/water also trys to sink into the deep world of meaningful lyrics but just ends up drowning, think i might have proven my point there worst record ever made along with any manufactured pop music/pop music and anything you would hear coming from an lift (elevator) or department store, it's not that i'm cynical when it comes to the promise ring it's just they really are a terrible pretentious band with every song having the same endless drone to it 
 Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product. 
 This book was missing words and had typos 15 years ago. Since then there have been 3 major revisions to the dictionary. The last update alone had over 3200 words removed or added. By including words that have been removed such as DA and not including words that have now come to be accepted such as FE this book leads you far behind. Hook words like these make a huge difference when looking for good plays. This book is too outdated to be of any use to anyone looking to improve their game. Take the advice of the champion player who wrote the first review listed 5 years ago and get your info somewhere else. 
 What could've been a good guide to modern indie film is bogged down by Pierson's relentless and self-serving tooting of his own horn.  Who cares?!?  What we really want is the inside story of all these independent films and filmmakers.  Pierson seemed to lose track of who the stars of his book should be.  I also found the author's writing and his overall knowledge of movies to be lacking.  A much better book on the same broad topic is "Celluloid Mavericks" by Greg Merritt, which covers the entire history of American independent film from a much more literate and balanced perspective 
 This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.  The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.  As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item 
 I got ripped off. I thought it was a good price for the hardcover edition, but I got the soft cover. It didn't return it becuase I'm lazy but I should have 
 Nicw soft sheets but will wash away after not too many washings. One of the pillow cases is already coming unthreaded after just two washes 
 This author bashes past research findings, citing limited research parameters, then spins her own findings as the most relevant, without adequately supporting her claims.  This should be a book about divorce and dealing with the process, not a thinly-veiled political commentary.  Contrary to what is written in this book, conservatives and their governmental policies are not to blame for the increase in divorce rates.  If "serial monogamy," where one enters into a marriage without expecting it to be a lifetime commitment is in line with your thinking towards marriage and/or divorce, this book is for you 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 I bought this item based on price, how can you go wrong for 10$ for a programable coffee maker? Well, you get what you pay for. after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks, it just stopped working! Just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item! based on the rest of the reviews, I just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee. lesson learned.  treehous 
 After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD.  Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones.  As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground.  The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me.  The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic.  Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear 
  I hate to be a kill-joy, but I'm tired of rave reviews, which fail to take stock of what Heidegger's philosophy meant - when tranlated into his chosen social (German/Aryan supremacist)context. Like the 'Introduction to the Metaphysics,' this book says more about Heidegger's preconceptions - than the actuality of 2,500 Years of Western philosophy.    Heidegger regarded 2,500 years of Western philosophy as a compounded error - built on Platonism. But what drove Plato to philosophize? The answer - Thaumazein - the 'wonder of being.'    Neo-Platonism was the driving force behind the Renaissance, via Ficino, Mirandella etc., anything but a sign of the 'forgetfulness of Being' attributed to Platonism or Platonists - by Heidegger. And what did Heidegger's Nazi philosophy spawn? Death camps, enslavement, human misery on an unprecedented scale. Heidegger 'enthusiasts' have been in denial too long, over the implicit connection between Heidegger's critique of traditional philosophy and his espousal of Nazi politics. But if you read Farias - 'Heidegger & Nazism,' which documents the German philosopher's involvement with the Nazi movement, it becomes clear that Heidegger supported German National Socialism because it appeared to give room for his philosophy. Even after the war, when the scale of the Nazi holocaust became clear, Heidegger remained mute about his support for the Nazi party and made no 'moral' revaluations in that respect.  All the talk about 'destiny' etc., in Heidegger's writings, was part of that. Don't read this stuff as if it was meant to live in a social vacuum.   
 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 I ordered King size, the label says King, but the sheets are Queen size!  Plus, there are light blue (ink?) spots splattered on them! I wouldn't have ordered them if I had known, because they're not worth the price. This is misrepresentation & false advertising.  Not happy with these 
 I must begin my review by stating that I am a reader of all memoirs because I find them to be healing for the soul. The best memoirs are honest accounts, whether the truth is devastating, beautiful or just plain boring.  I bought 'A Piece of Cake' because the rave reviews and because it was becoming available in paperback. After finishing 'A Piece of Cake', I must be honest that it is one of the worst memoirs I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The writing seemed to be done by a grade schooler: repetitive, juvenile and inconsistent - but this is not the reason the book is so bad. 'A Piece of Cake' is not a good read because I just don't believe 90% of what Miss Brown wrote.  I believe bad things can happen to a child in foster care, that kids in the ghetto get caught up in the gang lifestyle and addicts have a lot of interesting stories to tell. The reason I don't believe Miss Brown is that there is no honesty in her literary voice. Her stories are built from rusty crumbs and do not hold solid.  There are so many instances in the book that don't hold up to the light, but the most glaring untruth seems to be that the state of California would award custody of Miss Brown and her brother to their biological father and at the same time pay state dollars to a foster parent for their care. This especially seems untrue since there were other blood relatives who wished to take on the responsibility of caring for Miss Brown and her brother without the state's money. Since the whole book is based on this foundation, the whole story crumbles.  After reading 'A Piece of Cake', it is my feeling that Miss Brown was faced with many hardships in her young life and chose a road of self-destruction. She was able to climb out of the gutter and this is always a wonderful thing, but it does not necessarily mean that one's story should be made into a book.  Cupcake Brown obviously has many devoted fans of her book and I'm in the minority with my criticism. However, I stand by my review 100%.  Some memoirs that I highly recommend are:  'The Glass Castle: A Memoir' by Jeannette Walls 'Ava's Man' by Rick Bragg 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt 'Blackbird : A Childhood Lost and Found' by Jennifer Lauck 'Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith' & 'Operating Instructions' by Anne Lamott (or anything else by Anne Lamott) 'Running with Scissors: A Memoir' by Augusten Burroughs 'Naked' by David Sedari 
 I was a huge fan of the books growing up, and a lover of the period and Jannette Oke's books. I had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series. Well, I just finished -- and could hardly stop from yawning while I watched!    The movie started out well enough.  Wonderful filming, great costuming, glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time.  No, the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie.  The scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch.  I remembered the tomboyish Missie from the last film and couldn't wait to see her older.  The actress portraying the older Missie just did not do her justice! While she was pretty, she read most of her lines flat, with little emotion.  The worst was the very ending, which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter, instead fell completely flat.  In fact, most of the scenes with Missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left.  I think there were several attempts to portray Missie as spirited (like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant), but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid Missie we were continually seeing.    Apart from that, the rest of the cast was average, with a few star moments here and there.  I can't remember the book very well to check for accuracy, but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places.    Only if you want to keep up-to-date with the series, I would recommend this.  Otherwise, I'm glad they replaced Missie's actress for the next film.  Perhaps we'll get to see a more energetic performance. 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 Initially, this worked okay, but after a few weeks, i was swimming and all of a sudden my mp3 player stopped playing.  When I looked at the case, water had seeped inside, ruining my mp3.  
 Let me summarize for you.  Who knows if prayer works?  Who knows why God answers some prayers and not others?  I ususally like Yancy but he really disappoints with this effort.  
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 I wish I could give this zero stars.  Save your money and go get a spiral notebook at your local drug store, it would be just as useful.  I love the show Good Eats and had great expectations about anything with Alton's name on it.  I guess I should have read the reviews first. I am sending it back tomorrow for a refund 
 I noticed that this CD has "copy protection" installed. I have removed it from my cart owing to that. I don't need anyone's "rootkit" bugging my PC, and frankly, neither should anyone else 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 Amie:"I would say this book is a little less than average. I enjoyed the book Angel Medicine much more. The Angels seemed so much more peaceful and loving in her previous books which makes me think they are merely a projection of what the author is feeling at the time. Are they angels or inner thoughts and how can one really tell?"    I have reason to believe they are far more tilted towards herself than angels.  Whether reading this book or going to her site angeltherapy.com you will find a community message board where anything that you write that does not support her position, she or her admin team will immediately and high handedly delete.  I've seen postings on this site that says if you question her or her affiliates the admin will take you down.  Now consider the topic of this book & what she is writing about.  Thats not exactly Angelic, is it?  The reason I mention her site on angeltherapy.com is because you clearly see further evidence of what Amie says --  That the writings come far more from her than from Angels.  Why include all this on Amazon.com?  Very simple!  A genuine message from Angels is something I myself would like to read.  Having explored the evidence I really dont think this book is as much Angelic communication as much as it is Doreen communication.  If your looking for Authentic Angelic communication you may have to look this book over a little more carefully 
 Look, people, this book is NOT REAL. It's a hoax. Every single word of it is made up, though I must congradulate Dr Fell on imagining so many details. There were no Vikings, Romans, Arabs, or Celts waltzing around the Americas. The closest that it ever came were some Viking expeditions up in Canada. Don't you think you'd see the remains of Roman towns, or buried viking ships, or anything other than some scribbles that, if you squint, can look like Ogham? It's like seeing shapes in the clouds. Dr. Fell is NOT a historian, nor an archeolgist, nor anything related to history. What is he a doctor of? Marine biology. I kid you not.  So stop reading this stuff. The history of the Americas is far too interesting to clutter up with hoaxes like this. If you want to know the real Native American history, go ask them 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 I must say that this book did a very poor job at proving it's point. Nancy Campbell, in Be Fruitful and Multiply, utterly fails to show that God condemns the use of birth control in His law. She often resorts to rhetoric and makes unnecessarily extreme statements that simply are not in the passages she cites in support. At one point, she describes speaking at a conference. She asked the group of women there if any were pregnant at the time and not a single woman raised her hand. She implies that such shouldn't have been. This is absurd. After all, does not God control the womb?  As far as her specific proofs go, almost all of them are non sequitur. Her arguments are not logically conclusive. For example, the classic, "But children are blessings" argument that is so often heard is simply taking scripture beyond what it says. Yes, children are blessings, but why do we then conclude that we have to have as many as we can? Why doesn't this follow with other things that are clearly blessings from God, such as wine, grain, clothing, money, etc.? This is inconsistent.  Furthermore, the argument from which she gets the title of her book is another good example. Yes, we are commanded to be fruitful and multiply, but does this mean every single coupl must have as many children as possible? The command does not only imply unrestrained childbearing, but it is also a general command to mankind as a whole, not every single couple.  Doug Phillips, head of Vision Forum (www.visionforum.com) does the same in his foreword, which is a good summary of the popular arguments against birth control. His arguments here are all very poor logically and assume too much in developing his conclusion that birth control is sinful. He also even attempts to shift the burden of proof onto those who would say that birth control is not necessarily sinful.  By condeming an action as sinful without the appropriate scriptural backing, Nancy Campbell has added to the law of God. She has condemned something God has not condemned. This ethical issues should always be approached with much caution and thought, much more than is displayed in this book. Though I definitely support the fact that she is attempting to discern scriptural teachings on the family, as I am also a conservative in regards to familial issues, I do not support her condemnation of birth control. She has unfairly condemned the actions of countless Christians 
 i am dumber for watching this. just a van going from town to town. with kids talking about how 'bad' their neighbourhood is!! nothing happens. just dumb people talking some sort of english that is barely understandable.... 1 star.. 
 What a piece of garbage. I cleaned the toilet surface squeaky clean. With a little bit of pulling, I was able to pull this off time and time again easily. An angry and persistant 10 month old could do the same. Until I find what works, we're just keeping the doors closed for the bathrooms 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
  I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the "CHINOOK State", Mt.St. Helens did not have "LAVA" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a "PAIR of winds" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal.                                                         
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 to Emma Ohara of uk re names of Bloomsbury Group:the main ones are Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, Vanessa Bell, Clive Bell, Duncan Grant, Lytton Strachey, Maynard Keynes, Saxon Sydney-Turner (an original member  from Cambridge), also you could include Carrington, Roger Fry, David  (Bunny) Garnett, Desmond McCarthy,Ralph Partridge, Frances Marshall  (Partridge), Ottoline Morrell, Adrian Stephen, Alix and James Strachey. I  hope this helps-they are fascinating people well worth explorin 
 I bought this book in hopes of discovering a better grasp of what foods and combination of foods I should eat, as a vegan, while training for the LA Marathon.  Instead, this is like reading someone's personal diary with absolutely no valuable information whatsoever.  The few hopes he offers as far as a menu plan or even a recipe he leaves out of the book and says there will be a recipe book published later.  So, basically, he wrote this book to try to sell a different book yet to be published.  I have been vegan for only a year and yet my knowledge far surpasses his.  In fact, a lot of his advice is bad, unhealthy, and ignorant.  For example, he claims that taking in absolutely no nutrition before a long training session is a good thing and encourages it in a rather braggert sort of way.  Obviously this guy knows nothing about body metabolism or function. This book is basically from the perspective of someone saying "hey, I'm over 40.  I gave up meat.  I do endurance sports.  Ain't I cool?"  Don't waste your money or time. It is a very frustrating, empty read.  Brendan Brazier's book is a bit better if you're desperate for food ideas while training for endurance sports.  At least with his book you get some menu plans and recipes.  
 It's amazing how idiotic and utterly ignorant of the outside world these socialists are.  First of all, any book that fails to mention the utter greatness of Ronald Reagan (truly the greatest president ever) is propaganda. From start to finish, this book reads like standard communist propaganda. No mention is ever made of left-wing crimes, like Stalin/Mao, etc. Communism has killed more people in the past century than any other ideology EVER. Any book which doesn't mention this or give it proper emphasis is PROPAGANDA. All the whining about "American hegemony", etc, have to be put in perspective. What is your alternative? Russian hegemony? The Russians would be ruling in our place if Chomsky were in charge during the 1970s.  If you read it expecting intellectual stimulation, don't bother 
 Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Very simple to use and made a great cup of coffee (per my wife, I don't drink coffee).  It lasted a total of 3 days.  On the third day all it would do is flash two of the blue lights.  Wouldn't beep, would'nt pump water, nothing.  Believe all the negative reviews you keep reading and stay far away from this unit 
 I bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player. I tried it for at least 10 times, but no luck. Wet clean the lense manually is the best way, but that will include getting the player out from the dash board 
 I'm sorry that I ordered these online. I should have tried them first. They do not fit round heads. No matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit. The bow needs to have an adjustment too.  The magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off. Would not buy another pair. 
 I was extremely disappointed when I read this book. Rough Amusements: The True Story of A'Lelia Walker etc. should be retitled as the True Story of Jennie June. If you want to learn more about Jennie June and [alternative] culture in New York during the late 1880's to the 1930's read this book otherwise pick up a copy of The Black Rose a much better fictionalized account of the life of Madame C.J. Walker and her daugther A'Lelia 
 My current field of research is the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. I thought it would be a good idea to read about some of the ancient history in the region though so I read John Julius Norwich's A Short History of Byzantium as well as his History of Venice. Both excellent works. Then I read Lord Kindross' work, Ottoman Centuries. This was my first historical work that I have read devoted entirely to the Ottoman Empire.  I was very disappointed. I gave the work two stars because it reads excellently, at times like a novel. However, now that I am finished reading it I am left wondering how much of what I read was in fact, true. I state this because a lot of the statements about the Balkan countries aren't factually correct. The most glaring one I'll provide. On page 356 the author writes: "Thus a peace conference was held in the last months of 1698 at Karlowitz, in Croatia, on the right bank of the Danube."  He is refering to the Treaty of Karlowitz. However, the treaty was signed in Sremski Karlovci which is in modern day Serbia. I should know, I've had a private tour of the building where the treaty was signed. The city was never actually a part of Croatia, at the time of the treaty it was, one could argue, a part of Hungary but never Croatia.  Also, the author has a common theme of trying to argue that the Ottoman army never practiced forced conversion to Christianity. But then will describe the Janissaries and admit that the very foundation of the Janissaries was taking Christian children forcing them to be Muslims by raising them as such with no other option. He also discusses how churches were converted to mosques constantly following conquests but apparently, that doesn't fall within the realm of forcible conversion. Here is another example of what I am talking about:  On page 559 "Abdul Hamid...offer(ed) his enemies, at the point of a bayonet, the choice between death and forcible conversion to Islam--a practice previously renounced, under British pressure, by Sultan Abdul Mejid." (Which was the previous Sultan). However, on page 26 (just as one of many examples) the author writes, "There was no general Islamization of Christians--least of all by compulsion--within Ottoman territory."  The list goes on and on of constant contradictions within this work which makes this it so hard to take seriously.  Also, the author, or perhaps editor, has an annoying habit of placing words in quotation marks. Serbian Emperor Dusan is "Emperor" Dusan who rules over an "empire" and the balkan states are "nations" though later in the book they become nations without quotation marks.   I would only recommend this work to be read for entertainment purposes. I shall now search for another history of the Ottomans, hopefully one that is more academic 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these...  
 Granted, the author got some interesting ideas. But why does he hide them for the most part of the book? About 80% of the book is a repetitive description of different facts, theories and opinions, with the author arguing about "what is not correct", and no clue at what is he getting at. Well, not fare, he gives some clues, but not more. Sometimes it looks like he's got carried away with a need to talk (or write) without any point to deliver.   Again, that's not to say that he does not have any interesting things inside, he certainly has. It's just those interesting things would fit into 20 pages if described without well-known, repetitive and not-so-exciting things 
 "Execution" was as interesting as this one is useless. Don't buy. it is only blablabla! As always in movies, sequels are not as good as the original. However, I highly recommend their first book "Execution: the discipline of getting things done".  
 I am an adult fan of teen books and this one didn't cut it for me.   The story was a little hard to follow and lost me sometimes. Everything in the story was resolved, but the road to it was choppy and confusing. The way everything worked out TOO perfectly in the end was a bit far fetched. The overall writing was mediocre at best.  I did like that the main character was a "normal" person though and not hard to relate to. If you don't expect too much from it, it is entertaining. 
 First of all, thanks amazon for not listing the dimensions of this... it is 38mm deep, not 25mm like the other 120mm Antec fan in my case.  The only reason I bought it is cause I had gift cards and needed one, so I thought why not put an Antec fan in my Antec case.  WRONG, it was a waste of my gift cards.  It is just too loud.  I have a Sonata case and this is the loudest thing in there... and it is even hooked up to the PSU's fan controller power cords, which supplys minimal power.  It is just too expensive for the noise.  Dont even think about connecting it to a regular 4-pin connector, I tried this and it sounded like a jet engine is in my room!  It probably woke up my neighbors 
 Here is an another author whom claims to be a disciple of the illusive Don Juan. My impression after reading this book is that Mr Eagle feather is a frua 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 Had hoped for much more... it's the type of book that sets up the conflict for 200 pages, massages it for 60 more, and then resolves it in only 10!!  VERY unsatisfying ending 
 I do not mean to offend anyone but this CD is awful! His 2nd CD was better, but not much! 
 The author has clearly done great research.  The primary sources he has used allow him to present a very compelling story.  Unfortunately, it appears that he published his first draft: full of typos, grammatical errors and contradictory statements.  Too bad, because the content suffers from the complete lack of copy editing and ultimately it is an unsatisfactory read, no matter how good the material and how arduous the researc 
 There was a time that an artist selling a 1.000 records could claim to be a bigger seller than Rod Steward. It should have stayed this way. Instead Rod chose to come back with his interpretation of the American Songbook.   It has been an insult to both the songbook and the legendary artists who've contributed to it over time. It is hard to imagine that those who've been enamored by the likes of Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, and Louis Armstrong or even Tony Bennet could find any beauty in these records.  With the first release I hoped it would stay at that. But Rod's audience caught on. Surprisingly the critics didn't kill him as well. Thinking I missed something before I forced myself to listen to it again. Only to find that the releases are a horror. His deliverance and timing are completely off and the arrangement are unimaginative. Rod Steward doesn't ad anything to the American Songbook, he tears it down. This boxed set is totally uncalled for. Not only because of the weakness in material, also because it just repackages the previous material without adding something to it considerably.   Rod should stick to the beautiful Soulful Rock he did in his heyday and leave well enough alone. I'd advise everyone to stay away from this and stick with the classics. 
 the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on.  it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit.  Very poor choice for a grab bag.  Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company 
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.  
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 Did not care for the selections on this CD 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 My issues with this book include  - Concepts used before being defined e.g. reduced mass - Essential definitions only made in fine-print footnotes - Problems in the end of the chapter that simply could not be solved based on the material provided. One of the problems I had trouble with was covered in a third year text in several pages with two embedded exercises for the reader (with hints)! - Errors in the text e.g. speed of light off by a factor of 100! - Errors in the answers to problems  - Problems at the end of the chapter that require information only provided in previous problems which you may not have done, or even in *later* problems which you are most unlikely to have done. - Much of the material is very sketchy and it is hard to tell whether we are supposed to just take something on trust or whether we are supposed to know why it is the case. Particularly the coverage of special relativity is sketchy. - Inconsistent and unclear use of symbols e.g. k = boltzmann's constant, = coulomb's constant, = "wave number". You are just assumed to know which one is meant. - Style and approach differs significantly between chapters which makes reading more difficult.  I estimate it took me twice as long as it should have to get through this material because of these and other problems. I often had to look through other texts to find an explanation of things. Invariably things were explained more clearly and accurately elsewhere.   Chapters 1, 4, 7 and 11 are particularly bad.  On the positive side I thought the authors' intent is good. They are trying to give you a feel for how physics is done, and partly succeed.   Overall this book is a disgrace though. Try and find something better 
 This book is so hard for an undergrad to understand , dont buy this book. There are many others that are much better. Teachers like it because it has a lot of problems to solve but these guys could not describe how to turn out a light and make it understandable. I would recommend Cengal and Boles over this rag 
 I never received this book and I don't know how to get in touch with any other to get my money back.  
 Sorry, but this book just wasn't good. I think the first problem came early on when Jared compares Cassie to a child in terms of her body. This really turns me off because early on she acts like a child also. He really thinks she's 14! That's not romantic @ all. And, ok, I know it was island culture and all but having Cassie run around Topless, just isn't romantic. It's like leave something to the imagination! And, if she is going to be topless, please don't let her body be that of a 14-year-old, and not voluptous/sexy. That way it'd be easier for me to see the initial appeal Jared sees in her 
 Judging by both of their collections of "hits", the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s, and unfortunately, beyond. These two "pretend" rockers hit the radio with junk like "Crocodile Rock" (John) and "Uptown Girl" (Joel), thus cementing their respective geek reputations. Yuck! Neither Elton John nor Billy Joel have made anything authentic; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes, making them like the male equivalents of Gloria Estefan or Madonna. Yuck! Zero stars 
 As the professor of a Health Care Ethics class, I must admit to being very disappointed in this book.  The first chapter's definitions of classical ethical theories is dense and not helpful at all.  I didn't even have the students read it.  But, as a lawyer and someone finishing his PhD in philosophy, it is the abortion chapter that I found to be quite troubling.  He selectively uses quotations and selectively lays out arguments in order to refute the position he doesn't agree with.  Here it is the anti-abortion position.  I tell my students that the true philosopher is he or she who can see the other side's complete argument and can restate it even better than they.  It is only such a person who can make an informed ethical decision.  This text does not adhere to that intellectually honest principle.    Here are a few examples of where either the facts are wrong or the text is slanted.  The introduction to the abortion chapter lays out a "history" of the debate and basically says that abortion was legal until men sought to show women their place and until the Catholic Church engaged in a war against science.  He really says this--see p. 125.  "As the church retreated from science during the period from about 1869 to 1900, it encouraged attention to Mary (who had been neglected), supported 'creationism' against geological explanations of the origins of the universe, emphasized miracles (the miracle of Fatima was recognized shortly after the First Vatican Council), and vigorously attacked Darwinism."  Not only is most of this historically inaccurate or incomplete, it certainly has no place in a textbook, let alone one on Health Care Ethics.  (By the way, Fatima was in 1917 and the First Vatican Council ended in 1870.  When does something 47 years later become "shortly after"?  Numberwise, 47 years ago was 1959.  Would we say that events in 2006 occurred "shortly after" something that happened in 1959?  That's my point.  You have to go way out of your way to be this biased--and it has no place in a textbook!)  Further, he says on p.137 that the fetus does not have brain waves until the 25th week of gestation.  He states this without a footnote.  In fact, the fetus has detectable brain waves between the 40th and 43rd day post-conception.  That is the end of the sixth week.  (See Eric Olson's _The Human Animal: Personal Identity without Psychology_ and John Kavanaugh's _Who Count as Persons_.)  Nor does he address questions about a beating heart, fingerprints, or the ability to feel pain.  These are all marks of a person and should be part of any intellectually honest discussion of abortion.  His discussion of the potentiality question relies very heavily on the legal definition of a "person," but never says why that matters.  A 1-day old baby is a "person" under the law, but has no sense of self and is not rational.  Why then is it protected but the 2-week old fetus is not?  He says the difference is that one is a "person" and one is not.  The problem is that that is a legal definition, under a 14th Amendment analysis.  It, however, does nothing to dispute Noonan, as he suggests that it does on p. 137. Listen to how bad his reasoning is: "However, having the potential to become a person is not being a person, as we realize when we consider the thousands of frozen embryos...[Also, this argument] collapses the distinction between being human and being a person."  The problem is, however, that he has never told us why the fetus is not a person.  He just assumes it--basically saying, "Well the law says it's not a person, so it's not a person."  What kind of reasoning is that?  Reader, I suggest you pore over Chapter 5 closely and tell me if you find anywhere where he offers an ARGUMENT of why a fetus is not a person and a 1-day old child is.  He doesn't because it's not part of his agenda.     I could go on an on, about what he chose to talk about and what he chose to ignore, about what he chose to characterize fully and what he chose to caricature.  I think that the book has some strong points, but just don't go into it expecting a full and philosophical, let alone historical, discussion of an ethical issue.     As a professor, I could easily present slanted arguments and try to sway students.  One of the reasons I chose this textbook, however, was because I wanted something decidedly neutral.  I wanted the students to *think* and see clearly the issues on both sides.  Toward that end, I have been very disappointed.   
 Between the amended "politically correct" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong 
 I'm really upset with this item. I registered for it and when I got it the thing didn't work. I called the 800 number trying to see if I did everything right but couldn't get a live person on the phone. I went and exchange the item and the second one didn't work. Horrible Horrible product and business 
 So Sony did it again. This time it is `Single White Female 2.' Now I want to ask you seriously. Do we really need another version of `Single White Female'? Before you answer the question, take a look at the writers' name of the film Ross Helford and Andy Hurst, both responsible for `Wild Things 2' and `Wild Things: Diamonds in the Rough.'   `SWF2' is just another direct-to-video film with almost no redeeming points except as a reminder of the original `SWF' which was not a great film, but still far better a thriller than this one. Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh (especially the latter) were very good, and Barbet Schroeder almost made us forget the impossible story with his camera. No such things can be found in `Single White Female 2' in which all you can see is the similar story told in a slower and clumsier fashion.  Once again we are to meet a single white female (working for PR film in NYC) Holly (Kristen Miller) who starts to live with another single white female Tess (Alison Lange). It takes some time for the new roommate to find that she is living with a very unusual girl, who hates other people's lies but can wear someone's else dress without asking and go the seedy club named `SIN' (really). Who should she do? Live with her? Leave her? Apparently Holly doesn't know the right answer, doing stupid things one after another.  But before the film gets down to business as thriller, it has to show us so many thrill-free elements that only slow the pace: Holly's job and promotion, her unfaithful (and repentant) boyfriend; her back-biting co-worker who says `Sexual manipulation is my specialty"; and so on and on. As thriller the film fails to deliver, with the predictable path it follows, not-so-effective acting from the leads, and the poorly shot scenes that do not know how to convey the thrills even as cheap ones like gore. The film makes feeble attempt to engage our attention (here I'm talking about male audiences) with some images of the ladies in underwear in vain.   The original `SWF' was not without derivative script, but had several good moments like creepy character by Jennifer Jason Leigh and that high-heel. Though it is not terrible, everything is still bland and superficial in `SWF2. 
 Road to Omaha could have been a really funny and enjoyable book if the author had just gone a little softer with off the wall "coincidences" and having 98% of the conversations being disjointed screaming matches. As it is I bought 10 books for $1.00 at a yard sale and this books wasn't even worth the .10 cents it cost me. 
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 you will be not successful in Amway without truly understand what Amway/Quixtar means to our lives. The system is a fair system which is backup by lines of good quality products and service. Please can you name another company is as generous as Amway for satisfaction guarantee? it is a win-win business for line of sponsorship, and your customer is also a winner for using the quality, enviromental friendly and cost effective products. The author has not really been into Amway business and has no rights to make such judgement which is unfair to Amway and it's IBOs 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
 Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
 Whole Foods recipes are not as healthy as they prescribe, nor that tasty.  We have tried several recipes from this book with hopes that we would find something that would satisfy us.  We never found any 
 This is a fairly mediocre mystery novel in a series I've always found enjoyable if not memorable. But this one has something I'd not previously seen in any book, though I've heard it is a new trend. Apparently the author isn't making enough money from book sales and has resorted to product placement.  The frequent mentions of Walmart might have been overlooked, but the laudatory paragraphs advertising Home Depot in the middle of the book are startlingly obvious and strain credibility.  (Good service? Not in my experience.)  At any rate, advertising seeping into books is a terrible idea.  Let's hope it doesn't catch on 
 Ideas have consequences. Important ideas have important consequences. Wrong ideas have wrong consequences. Dangerous ideas have dangerous consequences.  This is not just an academic debate among brothers & sisters. The openly farfetched notions innovated here have eternal implications on just Who the REAL Lord is: the Bible's Jehovah-Jesus or an idol, fake, phony, man-imagined falsegod.  Which is Correct? The Bibleview or openview? Historical Christianity's position or Greg Boyd's personal opining? Did all the prior Bible scholars, theologians, preachers, reformers get it wrong only to wait for Greg to set it right???  I've read all the reviews here, especially the one that says to ignore all one-star reviews. Really? What if the True LordGod was warning against opening up your minds and souls to falsehood and deception? Is there nothing to the warnings of one-star comments? Should we only receive the five-stars? Not!  I like what someone earlier said: this book blesses us with things both true and new. Sadly, what's true isn't new and what's new isn't true.  If you're compelled to spend braincells here, do yourself a favor and check out the traditional/original view by Millard Erickson: What Does God Know and When Does He Know It? You'll see how one-sided Greg takes certain pet passages and makes them suit his body of beliefs, ignoring or stretching verses troubling to his made-up-in-advance philosophy of limiting God's future knowledge to forecasting like a weatherman or chessplayer giving us an UNCERTAIN deity for whom much of our free futures remains a MYSTERY to the divine mind!!!   Boyd gives us what Yale & Princeton gave him: process philosopher Charles Hartshorne's preconceived philosophistry's bias warped by modern science, mortal grasp of the supposed nature of the future and existence, yada yada yada.  Are you not in gross error because you know neither the Scriptures (in their entirety, not just favored selections supporting one's lame view) nor the power of God? 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 The CD was used as part of an Italia Fiesta we organised in Albury NSW, Australia. The music helped in setting the party atmosphere for the evening. The evening was held as fund raiser for the Murray Valley Sactuary Refugee Group. The evening was very successful 
 I purchased this book with the idea that the focus was on surprising secrets for the mystery shopper assignee. It is the other way around. This is a great book for retailers and not for the mystery shopper.   
 I have read many methods books over the past 4 years. This book was the initial text required in a methods class. I found it to be very poor in detail (especially for the preservice teacher). I finished the book wondering, "where are the specific how to's?" I felt that I wasn't prepared to go into a classroom to teach a lesson. We were all struggling in class.  So, I decided to go to another college bookstore and found "Methods for Effective Teaching" by Paul Burden. This book answered all my questions and went into great detail. It is based on the INTASC Standards and PLT of the Praxis 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read

 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 In Refuse To Choose, Barbara Sher badly confuses two very real but very different problems: the inability of some people to finish any project they start, and the shame dumped by family and friends on people who pursue many diverse passions in life.  The book rightly dismisses that misguided shame thrust on people with ecclectic interests, and in doing so may be very helpful and encouraging to an otherwise successful person who meets that description.   But for people who are unable to bring any project to completion, the book offers little useful advice, and several suggestions that are likely to make the problem worse instead of better.  Instead of explaining how to complete projects and escape from the traps that prevent them from being completed, the opening chapters dismiss the value of completing any project we start - an assertion even this book can't support for very long.  In the closing chapters of the book, Sher gives exactly the same advice that anyone else would: pick one project and see it through to the finish, ignoring all others.  And that's a reasonable suggestion, but it leaves most readers right back where they started.   In one particularly ill-conceived passage, Sher encourages overwhelmed parents to set aside parental responsibilities in favor of other priorities; she gives the example of feeding the kids cereal for dinner instead of going through another day's shopping routine, and asking the children to help out with an important business report instead of working on it privately.  On the surface, this sounds reasonable: why let drudgery sap away any more creative energy?  But a deeply misguided philosophy of parental and personal responsibility lies underneath this type of suggestion.  The children in this scenario learn that it is their responsibility to solve the parent's problems, and they also learn that eating properly and other such "adult" behaviors are ultimately unnecessary.  The parent in this scenario learns that the sound parental decision-making is unimportant - and then the parent wonders why the adolescent child shows no ability to make good decisions.  There are good ways for a parent to maintain a reserve of creative energy, but this ain't one of them.   Some of the ideas in the book are useful.  It is indeed a good idea to put aside others' negative judgments of our many exciting projects, and to find encouragement by making lists of past accomplishments, and to keep a journal of creative ideas, and to occasionally abandon a project with the same enthusiasm with which it was launched.  But these are not new ideas: Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way covers the same territory with much greater insight and wisdom.  If you're looking to free yourself from your inability to complete any projects you start, get The Artist's Way, follow its program, and find out what the real problem is.  And keep pursuing your many interests - but do it to satisfy your deepest desires, not to distract yourself from them 
 Minding the Spirit is a collection of previously published articles that have been grouped by topic for the study of spirituality in the Christian tradition. This book is a bit of a disappointment. In general, the book is a polemic for the field of spirituality as an academic discipline especially at the graduate level. Key concerns are the definition of spirituality and the object and method of study. A few authors note Paul's use of spirit (pneuma) or spiritualities (pneumatikos) but most authors identify Christian spirituality with Christian experience.  The reader will quickly notice how little Scripture is used in this book. The few biblical passages cited are mostly illustrations from previous theologians (e.g. Origen, Augustine). The Scriptures are seen as the basis of Christian spirituality but most authors in this collection are quite vague about connecting spirituality and the Scriptures and some struggle with the role of the Scriptures. For example, Liebert views the psalms as a special case in the canon but the canon is a special case in Christian literature so any encountered text can become a living text, 94.   The struggle to merge historical concepts (traditions) and post-modern thinking is evident throughout the book. One example would be J. Matthew Ashley's statement challenging theologians to, "develop the conceptual tools to manifest the truth - or perhaps better to make the truth," 160.  This book will be of interest to those who are seeking to grasp the agenda of the post-modern university for spirituality as a discipline.  It will not be of much help for any interested in a biblical or personal understanding of Christian spirituality or even those seeking a history of the topic. Yet, students of a theological mind would all profit from the chapter (article) by Elizabeth A. Dreyer on the Holy Spirit in Augustine. Though presented as being to a wide audience the book is decidedly Catholic in perspective with Karl Rahner being the modern theologian referenced by most authors. All in all it is a disappointing work on such a great topic! 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 I first saw this movie in high school-I believe i was a senior-And I remember thinking, "High school is NOT like this at all!" Throughout the whole movie. Now, I do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world, where anything is possible (except Laney Boggs becoming Prom Queen of course), but I felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie. First of all, why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a Prom Queen??? In my school, the Homecoming Court and Prom Court were chock full of nice, friendly kids, and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities, not because they were HOT like Taylor Vaugh or whatever her name was. I hate that stereotype because it doesn't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest! Also, What was so terribly heinous about Rachel Lee Cook that they would pick her over ANY other girl in the school-So what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body...her only flaw was her love for being a loner. Freddy Prinze Jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone WAYYYYYYY downhill since this movie was released. The best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when Laney walks down the stairs to Sixpence None The Richer's song KISS ME. The BIGGEST let down of this movie to me though was that Taylor won Prom Queen over Laney. Seriously, that still pisses me off to this day. The ending was just a complete and utter bomb...I wanted that skank Taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had SOME minor bad thing happen to her. She was just a horrible, snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her. Oh well, this movie is pretty lame...I will always remember it though because I saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year. Cheesy movie...Laney Boggs was robbed!! 
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 With the great business that has been flourishing to serve curiosity for Islam (read: hate for Islam) after 9/11 - this author joins the gold rush. Not only that he couldn't confirm with any evidence of document or other to Al-ahram newspaper that he has been affiliate of Alazhar universitie and earned a degree in Islamic studies there. But the book has many fallacies that can never be the outcomes of a person who studied Islam. I aticipate that the book will follow the destiny  of Norma khouri's book "Forbidden Love, A Harrowing True Story of Love and Revenge in Jordan ". The ethnic aspirations of the author are clear in his tone when speaking about the injustices that are done to his people - the Copts 
 I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well.  I only gave it one star because there wasn't a "no star" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.    As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise.  But once we met Baby and her "family" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on.  And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, "What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?"  What did I expect indeed.  No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film 
 As if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough, its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound. This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires.   And you couldnt get any g*yer. 
  Before anyone gets the wrong idea about this review,I'd like to say that One Way is a fabulous group.I think they are waaaaay underated.MCA/Universal or whoever put this garbage of a compilation together should be ashamed of themselves.One Way is in DIRE need of a worthwhile collection,and this one misses the mark big time.My guess is the industry has been overlooking One Way because their records have not been placing high on the charts or selling "Thriller" type numbers.What about us One Way fans that religiously bought those records? In short,where is "Love Is","Guess You Didn't Know","Lost Inside Of You" & "Toast To The Other Man"?  To wrap things up  One Way on a scale of 1 to 5:10 This Compliation on a scale of 1 to 5: 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 This is one of the worst children's games I ever played.  There are caterpillars to move around, but they don't really go anywhere, and it's so simple that even my 3 year old is completely bored with it.  Buy any other game but this one 
 What happened to this book?  It is a disgrace to the star wars universe.  It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all.  In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!! 
 This book was sooooo bad, I didn't even finish it.  Thank goodness I read a library copy, as I would have been very perturbed had I paid money for it.  I was hesitent about choosing this book based on the cover blurb.  Two elderly ladies with a valet? In Regency England? How shocking!  But I suspended my disbelief and decided to give it a try.  (I usually like Catherine Coulter's books) I wish I had just trusted my first instincts.  What didn't I like?  The conversations were just simply bizarre. There is absolutely no consideration given to the mores of the time period. (In one scene the "hero" bathes the naked heroine.  In a small country inn. Where the doctor who's been treating her knows she's a girl.  And he's told the entire countryside.  The local squires wife has donated her night gown for the "heroine" to wear.  The vicar has been by to give her last rights.  And yet, the young unmarried "hero" is permitted to nurse a young,naked, unmarried "heroine" who has been impersonating a boy, but everyone knows is a girl.  It is at this point that the book banged against the wall.  I did pick it up again...but I couldn't go more than a chapter beyond before I gave up.  This book was just inane.  Skip it 
 Buyer beware, the quality control on this and other strawberry shortcke dvd's is questionable. My daughters own all of the SS dvd's and at least half of them freeze up and shake, no matter what TV or dvd player it's on. Very frustrating, and disappointing for little ones. The stories are cute, just be aware of the return & exhange policy in case of this and other SS dvd items don't work correctly 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 I didn't get what I thought it was going to be.  Can I please return this package 
 Morris Lamb dies suddenly of what appears to be plant poisoning: his plants.  When his house is sold to an Episcopalian priest and her deaf dog companion starts to have seizures, Holly Winter, dog writer and lover, starts to investigate.  I have enjoyed this series that takes place in Cambridge, Ma. I'm definitely a dog person and these are definitely dog lovers books, filled with all kinds of tips and tidbits on dog companions.  I was extremely disappointed in this one, however.  The writing is choppy.  The characters that haven't already been introduced in previous books are underdeveloped.  Conant often seems to babble. I didn't really understand how her opening statements about aliens and ufo's had anything to do with dogs.  The Dog Lover's Mysteries have been a favorite of mine so I'm going to give it another chance and read the next one, but I wish someone had told me earlier not to waste my time on this one.   
 I am a huge fan of the Series Of Unfortunate Events & found this book only slightly entertaining.  It in no way added anything to the series in any way.  If you have read the books & the Unauthorized biography then you have all the info you need to not waste your money on this book.  If you have not read the Unathorized Biography I would recomend spending you money on that first!  
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!  Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!   
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 Boilerplate rhetoric about how the US is the global policeman and no longer a republic but an empire.  We've heard it all before...yawn...  And I even agree 
 By trying to show that science is multicultural-meaning either that knowledge is valid only within a particular socio-cultural context or that socio-cultural or political factors are imbued within the content of science, Harding disputes the conventional view characteristic of the scientific enterprise: knowledge accumulation, objectivity, disinterested inquiry, universality, rationality, unity of science and parismony.  She presents her case by employing a range of disparate arguments some of which are; 1) irrelevant examples, 2) her `strong objectivity' argument, 3) Western science is an amalgam of other cultures' sciences and technologies, 4) propositions are valid relative only to the considered alternatives, 5) radical philosophy of science claims, 6) mistaken blending of science and technology, 7) increase of knowledge creates increase of ignorance somewhere else, 8) linguistic modifications fill in for philosophical discourse, 9) `knowledge systems' are local.  I think none of these approaches go to any length in answering her question.  Below are a few of my responses to some of the above.  1)  Early on, Harding mentions Traweek's study of American and Japanese physicists but then we are told that Traweek didn't detect differences in knowledge production between these two cultures.  I wonder how this example is relevant.  Harding speculates about theory plausibility and geography.  "... cultures living on the edges of continental plates might well find the geology of plate techtonics [sic] more plausible (and "interesting"!) than do cultures with little experience of earthquakes, volcanos, and other phenomena characteristic of plate-juncture environments.  The latter may have developed geological theories based on their experiences of the vertical movement of the earth visible in mountain ranges--theories that appear implausible and/or uninteresting to the plate-juncture dwellers." (p64)  First off, which culture would come up with the extraordinary idea of plate tectonics or experience vertical motion of mountain ranges??  Alfred Wegener, the originator of the theory of continental drift was born, lived and worked in Germany and Austria.  After I plotted his various residences and compared it to earthquake hazard and volcano maps of northern Europe, I found that he resided in virtually the most geologically quiescent area in Europe.  Even the one volcano in Germany (the West Eifel Volcanic field on the west side of the Rhine river) was nowhere near any of his residences.  And most geologists of the time--even those who lived in high earthquake zones--gave his theory a cold reception.  This one major data point seems contrary to Harding's geo-speculation.  According to her, Wegener would of found his own theory highly unlikely. (...) 6)  On page 11, Harding first argues that scientific knowledge is created using technological practices and technologies.  Then she claims that scientific research is focused on creating useful or new technologies (which is not really the case).  She then concludes that scientific knowledge is inseparable from the technologies of its production which she then cojoins into one: technoscience.  This is simply fallacious.  Science, basic research, tries to answer certain questions about how nature works.  Theories or hypotheses *can* eventually be applied to produce new technologies.  Additionally, you don't have to have a science to have technical know-how... which is different from knowing why or providing an explanation or making a prediction.  Do other cultures have a science like the 'West'?  We don't know as none of the other cultures' sciences are ever discussed or detailed in the book.  As Lewis Wolpert states; "The motivations behind science and technology are very different.  The final product of science is an idea, or information, probably in a scientific paper; the final product of technology is an artefact--the clock or the electric motor, say.  Unlike science, the product of technology is measured not against nature but in terms of its novelty and the value that a particular culture puts on it."  (p31. The Unnatural Nature of Science.)  So just because science uses technology doesn't mean it automatically should be subject to the same value analysis as that of technology or applied science.  Some scientific theories or ideas may never have applications: black holes, quantum computing, gamma-ray bursts, etc.  Others have seen applications such as the laser.  Surprisingly, on the same page, Harding acknowledges that one can talk about technology without talking about science.  Unfortunately though, we don't really get this through the rest of the book.  Instead, we get science conjoined to technology which then gets blamed for all the hideous techno-environmental disasters.  But as Gross and Levitt point out in their hard-hitting critique of the postmod relativists and the like; "For every bomb there is a vaccine; for every ICBM, a CAT scanner." (Higher Superstition, 1997)  9) "...all knowledge systems, including those of modern sciences, are local ones." (px)  Harding implies that knowledge is infused with various geographical, socio-cultural, political, gender or personal biases of its origin of creation.  Ignoring for the moment that this local knowledge claim is actually a universal one, she argues that universality is a specific cultural and epistemic characteristic of the West and is actually used, according to her, to invalidate and de-value other 'knowledge systems'.  (Again, no real examples are provided.)  But we have to wonder how Relativity or chemistry for example, don't apply universally; or how they purportedly contain biases or de-value other local knowledge systems.  But if, as Harding states (p8), that scientific and technological ideas slip across borders as easily as air, then how can knowledge be `local'?  She also indicates that non-Europeans should have access to the benefits that international science and technology offer; but then, this is the same science that has supposedly destroyed, "de-developed," the local knowledge systems of other cultures.  We're trying to have it both ways here.  I would just say that the only real multicultural factor in science is in the composition of the scientific community itself 
 Roberta Flack is conspicuously missing from both the DVD and CD releases.  I have the original LP soundtrack, and  saw the original film, both of which included her great performances.  I don't know if this was her decision or the filmmakers, but you cannot call this the ORIGINAL film 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 Although beautiful to look at, this book is VERY difficult to put together.  It's listed as being for ages 4-8.  NO WAY.  Both my 8 year old granddaughter and I (Grandma) had a VERY difficult time cutting it out and putting it together 
 I was looking for a book to help with an upcoming trip to Glacier National Park area, but this one didn't fit the bill.  While I wanted suggestions for things to do, day trip recommendations, trail information, etc., this book is more like a "yellow pages" of Montana.  Want to know about motels?  It's here.  Want to plan activities?  Probably not the right book.  It's all black and white, very large (too large to pack), maps are scarce.  I'm going to look for a different option. 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 We started getting a "LO" message when using the thermometer. It said that we needed to change the probe tip and clean the lense. This worked for a little while. We changed the tip on each use.  Now nothing works. After spending near $50 on this I feel like a chump. I want to throw it out the window. I'm heading to the drug store now to buy something else 
 I question the authors authenticity and the survey mech... I do not doubt cosmic consciousness.. as I am one of these evolved humans... bucke writes of... I am however a defender of this experience and doubt that there are still more than a few that are alive today that have truly been transformed...  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! it supports mediocraty and delivers a blow of negative credibility to Bucke.  I do not doubt that others have this experience.. the volume of which the new reviewer claims is know to me to not be so.. by the nature of my connectedness with the light... even buke himself claims that there are few in the world of his time that have experienced CC... have we evolved much as a global culture in the last 75 yrs... well based on all my research and intuition the answer is NO!!!!!!.... we are becomming further entrenched with maya...  however i give you all a key.. one that can lead to the light for the committed.... at the rise.. GAZE 
 Before I launch into my own diatribe on the rubbish contained in this work, please see Ms. Wood's review of the historical accuracy of gender roles. I found her review to be a refreshing discourse on the history of the sexes in society.  Much like "beauty is in the eye of the beholder", apparently, "truth" is decidedly subjective. To pander to unfounded gender differences when assessing a neurobiological disorder and imply that a female with Asperger's Disorder (which is on the autistic spectrum) has a more "male" brain than a "female" brain is ludicrous. The author, in fact, appears to try very hard to make it appear that autism is just an extremely intelligent man with little or no empathy, instead of recognzing it as a disorder that has no prejudice as to the gender of its victim. And let's forget for a moment that the male-to-female ratio of "classic" autism is 4:1, and more and more credible scientific research indicates that Asperger's actually has a male-to-female ratio of 4:1 as well, instead of the previously accepted 10:1 ratio.  The cause of autism/Asperger's and other disorders on the spectrum is unknown and largely debated. It has been put forth that more males suffer from these spectrum disorders than females (and more severely) because a female has an extra X chromosome to rely on if there happens to be a "faulty" spot on a chromosome contributed from one parent, whereas males only get one shot with one X chromosome. A male has no back-up if he inherits a faulty X chromosome from his mother. That would be the only gender difference I can possibly ascribe to with regard to the "truth" about the difference in males and females with autism spectrum disorders.  I volunteer at a local food bank.   I helped with victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita when the evacuees poured into our state. My ten-year old daughter did as well. She emptied her closet, and everything that no longer fit her she bagged up, along with stuffed animals she decided the children affected by Hurricane Katrina needed more than she did, and we took bag after bag of clothing, food, water, etc. to assist these evacuees.   We have also long been fixtures at our local animal shelter, feeding and caring for these homeless animals.  The point??   For the majority of my career, I worked in the legal field as a paralegal, typically considered a "male" world.   I am now a biology major with a minor in chemistry, planning a career in pharmacy/toxicology and my daughter (again, she is 10)suffers from Asperger's Syndrome and has an IQ of 123. So, because I am an intelligent female who can master the sciences and my daughter has an autism spectrum disorder with a high IQ, we have "male" brains? If so, how would Baron-Cohen explain the fact that we are also very empathetic to other people's plights in life? Might we be scientific anomalies?  I would have expected much more from an "expert" who should know better than to reduce a serious, complicated spectrum of disorders with unknown causes to simple gender differences. I also would have expected a "professional" to understand how his work might impact a woman with an autism spectrum disorder, who already has enough difficulty functioning in this world, to be told by a "professional" that she now also has a gender-bending disorder and, thus, another problem.  I was extremely disappointed in this book and would be very leery of recommending it to anyone -- especially a sufferer of an autism spectrum disorder 
 Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a generation. Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council "Monkeys" and "troglodytes", had an interesting earlier career.    He was disqualified from the student government election in  his Beverly Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits. He took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and longtime republican insider Grover Norquist.    But more relevant to this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality.  During this period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority Afrikkaner government. The hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune, as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid.  An amazing historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america, and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line.  My advice, buy it used for historical purposes, not new.  This guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the American people.   Let's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style abuses of civil rights,  and many other crimes against humanity.  Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the USA.  Let this movie be a record of the power of Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth.  Let's make a different legacy this time around 
 what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians. It sounds like ESPN called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush 
 I bought CD because at the time, I was a huge Utada Hikaru fan. Her voice is shrill most of the time, but one can overlook that. However, after a time, her songs became boring. Her lyrics are boring too, and the average Jpop artist can write them. Ayumi Hamasaki is much, much, much, much better than Utada. If you want the real Jpop Queen, go for Ayu. If you want a shrill-voiced artist that's bland and boring, go for Utada 
 They allowed me to try one issue before I paid for the subscription.  After I read the first issue, I decided to cancel.  There are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written, for example, you couldn't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are.  The rest of the magazines are all advertisements, which you can get for free from the internet (or just anywhere) 
 David Fincher's Seven was undoubtadly one of the most unnerving mainstream films of recent memory, and after hearing the great, moody music from the film, I tracked down the soundtrack and was very disappointed.  First off, Howard Shore's orchestral scores are more than worth hearing and capture the depressed feel of the film, but the remix of "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails (which played during the opening credits) and David Bowie's "The Heart's Filthy Lesson" (which played during the closing credits) are not present here, which is very disheartening.  Gravity Kills' one time hit "Guilty" is here, but other than that there isn't anything else worth hearing.  If your a fan of the film and love the two songs I listed above, this is what to do.  For the remix of "Closer" is available on the "Closer to God" CD single, and Bowie's song can be found on his "Outside" album.  If your looking to buy this soundtrack for one or both those songs, beware, they are not here 
 I read 560 pages of slow, long-winded prose and was rewarded with a hasty conclusion.  There was no ending to this book.  After making my way through extensive histories, foreign words, and confusing names worthy of any Russian novel, I was given five or six pages of slap-shod resolution.  I understand that this book is only the beginning of an ongoing series, yet the Harry Potter series, the most well-known, epic young adult fantasy, features definitive conclusions within each volume.  Mark Twain said that if he had more time, he would have written a shorter book.  Sherwood Smith should have taken more time with this book.  I love the Crown/Court Duel books.  They are gripping, concise, and ultimately rewarding.  Inda is nothing like those books, despite being set in the same world.  Some of the ideas and story lines were entertaining and even gripping.  However, any enjoyment I received from the story was swallowed by my overwhelming disappointment at the conclusion mixed with my impatience for the story to move forward.  Overall, this book was a waste of my time.  
 I felt compelled to write this review.  I can't state this more clearly, don't buy this book!  I read the reviews stated here by other readers and the only one that I can forgive is the one written by the 6th grader.  This book is a mess!  Characters are introduced haphazardly and then forgotten.  The pace is confusing and the conflicts are resolved in an almost comical way.  Save your money!!!   
 A review of a book is somewhat or mostly dependent on what you were looking for initially. With that said and with an introduction by Nassim Taleb, I was looking for discussions and insights about risk, the market, and human psychology. Though some of these topics were present in some sections of the book and discussed, I unfortunately mostly read of poker strategy and game theory. However, if my selection of this book came from a solely poker perspective vs. the title and the introduction teaser, my review would have been higher.  However, one would have to agree with Mr. Brown's thesis that without risk takers the market would not work systematically as it does. Without the street to add "risk additives" to a continual flow of financial products, this would not keep the interest of the risk takers.  Good points - The discussions of the Mississippi Valley's economic network was great and on any next edition, I would highly recommend further discussions on this topic (i.e. the Planters vs. the Adventurers). However, I assume this topic was somewhat limited due to other's published work as noted. Also, the chapter on Soft Banks and its impact on the settlement of the West was interesting. In addition, the many references to other books was highly appreciated.  All in  --  A good book, but a little too much on the game theory. If you are a "Poker Affectionado", enjoy. 
 As Walter Laqueur observed in The Atlantic in his March 2002 review of this Gilles Kepel book, his " obituary of Islamism was written before September 11."   What seemed truly astounding when I read this book four years ago was the extent of Kepel's knowledge--and his fundamental ignorance. I hadn't realized, as I read, that the original French edition of this book came out in 2000. Still, it is extraordinary to think a scholar as widely read as Kepel could be so wrong, as he is here, as to pronounce radical Islam and jihad on the wane.   As the intervening years have proved, nothing could have been further from the truth, and of all people, Kepel should have known it. But it was not Kepel's lack of knowledge concerning the origins of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt of the 1920s, or the writings of Hassan al-Banna and his heir, Sayyed Qutb (whom Nasser hanged in 1966) that lead to the author's blindness.   It was most likely Kepel's lack of understanding of the fundamentals of Islam itself. Like so many writers before and after, Kepel blamed the rise of radical Islam on the backwardness of Middle Eastern society, and the lack of political power of the rising middle class.   As Laqueur noted in The Atlantic, Kepel laid the attractiveness of Qutb's radical "message and in particular his appeal to violence" to broad swaths of Egyptian society to several mostly economic and intellectual factors. Qutb resonated for "students who could not find jobs; the religiously observant lower middle class, distrustful of modernity; and, generally speaking, all those disaffected by the state of affairs in the Muslim world who had become intellectually homeless after the failure of Arab nationalist ideology and of Marxism."  Actually, however, both Qutb's philosophy and its attractiveness to Egyptians and other middle eastern Muslims were powered by the same force--the fact that Qutb based his thinking and writings on the classical jurisprudence of Islamic scholars across the centuries. And in this respect, Qutb was no different than many of the other radicals that Kepel covers, including the violent Iranian religious revolutionary, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Pakistan's Mawlana Mawdudi, among others.   To understand the rootedness of these "radicals" in Islamic religious precepts and Islamic history, Kepel ought to read Dr. Andrew Bostom's Legacy of Jihad.  Certainly, Kepel is right about some factors that encouraged Islamic radicals to pursue their goals at the specific times that they did: In the 1980s and early 1990s, Khomeinist fanatics terrorized Iran unchallenged, Islamists seized power in Sudan and their cohorts had attempted coups in Algeria and Egypt as well. But more importantly, ragtag Afghan Islamist armies eventually defeated the Soviet Union there, and built a very successful propaganda campaign (though undoubtedly not entirely truthful) as a result.  But Kepel did not understand how Islamists saw their defeat and alienation from the Algerian majority, Egypt's mass arrests of terrorists or Sudan's surrender of Carlos the Jackal to the French, for criminal trial. To radicals, these were merely temporary setbacks, not the heralds of permanent defeat. Nor were the radicals at all discouraged by the rise of Iran's so-called moderate, Mohammad Khatami (who was never really moderate) or the protests of Saudi women for the right to drive cars independently.   Worse, Kepel did not understand that many Islamic scholars--whom he and many foolhardy others  presume to be "reformist" thinkers--are themselves reputedly central figures in the Muslim Brotherhood, and in any case, fundamentalists in their own right.   Take Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of MB founder Hassan al-Banna, whose visa application the U.S. State Department has twice, rightfully, rejected. Kepel accepts him as the "reformer" he pretends to be. But this is utter nonsense.  As J.C. Brissard recently noted on the Terror Finance Blog, ample evidence suggests Ramadan has links to terror. A 1999 Spanish police General Directorate memo, for example, stated that Ahmed Brahim--who last April received a 10 year sentence for incitement to terrorism--maintained "regular contacts with important figures of radical Islam such as Tariq Ramadan."  Likewise, Djamel Beghal--sentenced to 10 years in March 2005 for participating in a foiled attack on the US Embassy in Paris--in September 2001 aligned his religious "engagement" to the 1994 time when "he was in charge of writing the statements of Tariq Ramadan." Beghal later said he had also "attended the courses given by Tarek Ramadan." And "brothers Hani and Tariq Ramadan," according to a 2001 Swiss intelligence memo, together planned a 1991 Geneva meeting between Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri and Omar Abdel Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center attack. This was confirmed by the member of a Geneva mosque, who heard Hani Ramadan announce the upcoming meeting.  While Kepel conducted extensive and sometimes useful research, his conclusions are unreal.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 Wasn't quite sure what to think from this earlier film from Ruggero Deodata, who brought us the universally "infamous" CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. I figured it wouldn't be nearly as rough or "controversial", and I was right. But JUNGLE HOLOCAUST is decent film in its own right... But seriously after watching this it wasn't all that great..... it was a bit ridiculous if you ask me.   The reason is this, there are only two good cannibal scenes, and there are some unnecessary animal deaths through out this film. I'm not saying that the animal deaths bother me. I just think that it should have a reason. If you are going to kill an animal for a film have it have a purpose. For example in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST when the turtle died they ate it afterwards. They actually used it! In this trash of a film a huge snake dies for no reason at all! An the scene when the crocodile gets slit open while its still alive, has a point, but I found that it still wasn't vary necessary. This film was not worth taking a life for! Its pure trash! there are really only three actual gore scenes. A tribal man gets his hand eaten by ants (which looks extremely fake!) The only good scene in this movie is when the girl that is helping our lead character gets eaten! That scene was awesome! that was the only thing that I found to be rewording in this film. This film basically drags out for a long time and has random pointless acts that go on for no reason. The one scene that annoyed me the most was when the tribal girl that is helping our main character escape from the cannibals is raped. An she is not raped by some one from the tribe, or some one fallowing them, she is raped by the person that she is trying to help! An for no reason at that! He just chases her down and has his way with her! It is pointless! An for some reason after this whole ordeal she finds respect for her rapist!   This film doesn't make sense! If you want to see a cheap cannibal movie that is enjoyable then go see Mondo Cannibal or Cannibal Terror. This film is worth watching out of curiosity, but don't waste your money. It's not that good. Rent it first if you can I'm glad that I did. 
 It smells great, like coconut.  I have long curly hair, and it made my hair dry and brittle.  I've noticed this with all of the LUSH conditioners I've tried, so I would not recommend it for naturally curly hair.  2 stars for the great smell 
 I was hoping for something a little more exciting. A really dry read 
 Any band that releases an album with a song titled "Rock You Tonight" should be banned from ever recording ever again.  I wish that rule would have been in place during Firehouse's hayday.  Thank goodness people were sick of this stale brand of Rock and quickly switch to more substantial listening choices.  
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 This book was so boring I really did not learn anything the book was full or errors. I fell asleep on this one please don't write anymore books. 
 Based upon other positive reviews I had high hopes for this book being informative, but it bases its data more on speculation than on fact.  When this book was first written at the time of the "revolution" (in 1979), the author wrote that he had heard that Israeli soldiers were part of the Shah's defense forces in attacks against anti-Shah rioters.  But twenty years later by the time of this 2001 re-publication, the author had not been able to ascertain that Israeli units had indeed been part of the Shah's defense forces -- speculation on rumor, but no determinable fact, although the anti-Shah forces had twenty years to comb through Iranian documents.  As the author presents a thin-bone background to the theology of Shi'ism, a reader is left powerfully hungry in looking for some 'meatiness' to the author's explanations.  Although this book is based upon four lectures that the author gave shortly after the 1979 revolution, the author rambles about in trying to make some coherent story. The author explains that the Shiite are split between two schools of thought, the Usuli and the Akhbaris, as to whether or not modern Shiites can "engage in independent reasoning with respect to legal questions" in the absence of the Hidden Imam.  The author examines this issue as it underpins the development of Ayatollah Khomeini's rebellion against the Shah: Khomeini argued that Shiite imams needed to take an active role in fomenting Islamic rebellion against the pro-secular Shah, rather than remaining passive.  The author all too briefly notes one of the imams' complaints against the Shah: that he was taking mosque-controlled lands and selling it to private individuals and thereby curtailing their income from those properties.  The author does not hide his pro-Shiite faith.  In response to one question asked of the author in 1979 as to whether or not he agreed that: "If national boundaries were taken away....the differences between Sunni and Shi'i would disappear in one instant", the author replied back then: "Very definitely."  However, twenty years later, by 2001 the author apparently had had a good dressing down by his Shi'i superiors and had to add a corrective footnote: "the differences themselves are deep-rooted and ultimately irreducible" (pg. 81).  This is not a book to read to learn about Shi'ism.  It is more of a television "talking heads" presentation based from several public lectures; a lot of polemics, but short on fact regarding riot casualties.  It barely rates being worthwhile for reading in understanding how the anti-Shah movement developed.  It is barely worth reading for a background 'feel' as to why religious leaders (imams) should be the only ruling leaders of an Islamic government (mujtahid); the people may vote for only those candidates who have prior approval from the imams and who toe the Shi'i theology.  This isn't a textbook, it is more of a compilation of "off the cuff" extemporaneous remarks in a lecture hall. Okay for a novice just starting to explore this topic, but read it at the library before buying it.  
 HD-515 is an entry-level headphone to 500 series. It however fails its promise. the sound quality (especially the base is nasal) is not good over all. Being a 500 it has a design that makes it comfortable but the question you ask is that why is it so big in the first place? Even though I had reviews on it I'm of the opinion that for the less price you could get more or less the same quality. However hd-515's sisters are very different on the matters of quality. I do recommend buying one of its sisters hd-555 or hd-595, instead. If those are too expensive I would suggest buying hd-280 pro for just a little more.  Note that when you're reading reviews on headphones it is subjective for a great part. I will have to explain what my taste is before giving a review to hd-515. I like my headphones to be comfortable using it for hours in a row. 500 series have a good way of offering a design that assures a high level of comfort. I also wanted noise cancellation in the beginning when I bought my hd-280 pro. It doesn't really have noise cancellation but it is a sealed headphone. It means that blocks noise in virtue of sealing the area around your ears. I have found out (I might be wrong but in my experience) that noise cancellation works best for people around you and not you. It is not the case that just by putting one the headphones the noises inside would block all the noises outside - but that in high volumes you are surely to hear just your own sound (not your heart beat or your breathing but the sound generated by the headphone. Sealed headphones generally do the same thing (just put cups or your hands around your ears and you wouldn't hear sounds outside as well!). However that all comes at a cost. Sealed headphones are generally speaking lower in quality. Noise blocking works best for non-listeners unless the volume level is high. So if people around you have no problem with buzz sound of your music ("privacy" they call it) then go for open headphones. I wouldn't want to buy something that blocks the sound for the convenience of others! So I would buy open headphones and get advantage of better sound quality. Yet open does not mean that you can hear everything outside your cans and doesn't mean others could sit around you and listen!  My first headphones were sennheiser hd-280 pro a sealed headphones that are not very uncomfortable. I traded in because they weren't comfortable (and for mysterious reasons my ears were hurting). I didn't get a chance to burn the headphones and sold it as soon as I could -- headphones are like cars. You need to use it for a while to get a good sound and break it in so to speak. So don't be too disappointed in the beginning. I sold those headphones to my neighbor and he couldn't be happier. As I have said it is very subjective why some people like their headphones. I know that he is a gamer and his last headphone was broken. Other than that he has no preference on the comfortableness of the headphones. He had worn those for hours without any discomfort. Currently I have put an order for HD 595. I will write a very short review once I receive it. 
 I really don't understand what all of the raves are about--this book was downright annoying.  It's one big name-dropper of a story that isn't at all about living life to its fullest.  It's a somewhat impersonal account of Jenifer Estess and her famous friends creating Project ALS, and what a hard worker Jenifer is, and how much her sisters loved her...blah blah blah.  When it is Jenifer telling the story (but see below), it comes off as arrogant and shallow.  I would have much rather heard about her thoughts on her estrangement from her dad and brother as she was dying (which was glossed over as "I don't really care") and what it was really like to be dying.  There were small parts of the book that did seem authentic but were totally rendered worthless when I read "I died on December 16...." and then the book goes on for another chapter.  Okay, obviously these aren't her thoughts.  What else about this story was fabricated?  Sorry Ben Stiller and Sara Jessica Parker, but this book was not worth my time 
 It's a reader for dumb impressionable first year students at best. If you are really serious about trying to understand common internet culture as it is currently evolving, you are going to waste time and money on this book. Even as a reader it lacks academic rigour, I would be quite worried about the callibre of the course for which this sad, sad attempt is prescribed 
 I read all of David's books and was very moved..however Richard's seemed to hit alot of the same incidents..in either case I can't believe no one ever spoke up to help..I do feel David's books were better written .. I feel bad anyone would have to go through life as they did.. I wouldn't pass this book as I feel it almost reads the same as David' 
 I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend.  I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people.  When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility.  Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover.  Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.  In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided.  
 Our culture is killing the planet. Car culture is incredibly destructive of the natural world.  Cars, for example, are the main cause of death for the gravely endangered Florida panther. And Knutson makes jokes about cars killing wild animals. Only a culture that has absolutely no respect for the natural world could produce someone who would think roadkill is funny, and would write a book about it. Knutson had a wonderful opportunity to meaningfully explore the horrifying effects of car culture, and chose instead to write this disturbing and disgusting book 
 The only thing perhaps more moronic than this tripe is those who have let themselves be bamboozled into thinking that there is something of deep thought and/or substance here.  I can only assume that those who found this entertaining are extremely insecure and think that if they like something that others who are perceived to be "important" like that they too will be "important".  The part of this I truly find mind-numbing is her "deep" and "thoughtful" insight into the solution to the violence/terrorism in the world;  all we need is "vagina warriors" working at the "grass-roots level".  You know what, let me reconsider my first observation; to call this moronic is an insult to morons everywhere.  It's sub-moronic 
 This short book is about the small Tuck family (a man, his wife, two young-adult sons, and their horse) , who inadvertently drink from a magic spring which renders them immortal.  Thereafter, they do not age, and seem immune to death by violence or accident.  In this state, they seem to live a happy, almost idyllic existence.  Nonetheless, they bemoan their fate as a sort of curse, which has removed them from the cycle of life.  Mrs. Tuck especially seems convinced that it would be a disaster if anyone else were to find out about the magic spring.  The exception to this sighing and moaning is the youngest son, who, perhaps because he has the good fortune to be stuck at 17, seems reasonably satisfied with his fate.  The main events of the story take place 84 years later, when a series of improbable coincidences involving the Tucks, an 11-year old girl, and a mysterious stranger, together with some idiotic behavior by all concerned, converge to force events to an contrived climax.  The author hints that these improbable convergences have some deep mystical significance.  Since this mysticism remains obscure, one is inclined to instead suspect lazy plotting.  The stupidity, and moral depravity, of the Tucks is evident in the fact that, for the last 84 years, they have done virtually nothing to conceal, guard, protect or destroy the magic spring.  And yet when (by pure luck) they learn that the spring is about to be discovered, they are willing to commit kidnapping and even murder to keep the secret from getting out.   The author strives to make the murder victim as unlikable as possible so that the killer (the Tuck mom) will retain our sympathies.  But the bottom line is that the sole motive for the murder is that the victim knew too much and could not be counted upon to keep a secret.  I cannot possibly agree that Mrs. Tuck had any right, therefore, to take his life.  The fact that the victim gloats about his less-than-noble intentions immediately before she shoots him, does not make her act any more morally palatable.  The stream, after all, does not belong to the Tucks.  What right have they to play God, and take lives to prevent others from sharing their high and lonely (if idyllic) destiny?  Setting aside moral questions, the stupidity of the Tucks is nothing compared to the stupidity of the villain.  Why on Earth did he not drink from the stream and render himself immortal?  Why on Earth did he not do this before going all by himself to a secluded location to have a gloating, taunting confrontation with four fully-grown immortals.  He is fully aware that the Tucks are determined to keep their secret, he knows exactly why, and he knows they are desperate or depraved enough to commit the kidnapping of a child for this purpose.  In fact, why does he confront them at all?  They were completely unnecessary to his plans, as he himself points out when, predictably, the Tucks refuse to agree to them.  Bottom line is, he went merely because the author wanted to give Mrs. Tuck an opportunity to shoot him, and he gloated and taunted only so the reader might say "Ha, serves you right", when sweet Mrs. Tuck blows his head off with a shotgun.  One of the ironies of this story is that, although the Tucks are convinced that the widespread availability of the magic water would be a disaster, we are nonetheless supposed to despise the villain for his selfishness, when he reveals his plan to disseminate the water only to those well-paying persons he considers most deserving.   And yet when Jesse, the youngest immortal, starts plotting to do something similar, we are expected to retain our sympathies for him.  I suppose this is because Jesse is a hot-looking 17-year old, is motivated (one supposes) by romance rather than cash, and his offer is, in effect, being made to the young female who is the target audience of this book.    I have no need to say how this latter plot thread resolves itself.  In the end, the moral of the story is ambiguous.  There is a lot of preaching about the curse of immortality, and the virtue of remaining a part of the life cycle, but what we are actually shown is beautiful people living an apparently idyllic existence in harmony with nature.  Is the moral of the story that we should not seek Earthly immortality, or that, if we should find it, we should keep it for ourselves?    This was a quick, easy, relaxing read.  It could have been much worse, but, on the theme of immortality, you will also find plenty better (Potter books, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, just to name a few) 
 Sonny Barger's tales are Slurs of Confabulations, False Recollections, Fuzzy Logics, basics of "FMS" (False Memory Syndrome). Sonny Barger demonstrates a "Limitless Capacity for Denail" therefore Distorting His Own Statements from Yesteryear. Mr. Barger was evidently under the impression, by placing his name upon a book that the reading public would be sensationalized into the Illusion Barger's some sort of an American Hero, Hardly. Mr. Barger speaks of Brotherhood & Freedom; Never Defining either. (Brotherhood was betrayal of silence after the RICO Trial. Freedom was before Barger's First Conviction, since he has never known real freedom.) All too-much in Barger's Book can be refuted by its mere statements. This book was obviously just put together for money and cover-ups. Publisher should have included an airsickness bag with each book. 10% of a book that covers over 40-years of Hells Angels History was spent taking cheap shots at the Government, over the RICO Trail 1979/1980. This was a Gamble by the Publisher, too-many have known otherwise. Publisher changing the title would help. (Hell's Angel: The Lies and Crimes of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club) 
 Does the author think that we readers will not see through the transparency of his condesending and patronizing tone and his unoriginal ideas?  Did the five star reviewers read the same book???  Mr. Gillingham Ryan takes himself way too seriously as a therapist and not seriously enough as a decorator. We readers want effective design solutions and not a lot of hype. Unfortunately, after spending hard-earned money seeking the former we are left only with the latter. Can we get a refund for the author's malpractice?  Strongly not recommended.

 I must admit that I am a guy and that I bought this movie before seeing it. I was not shocked with the horrible acting, but was surprised with the hot stars. This movie had both hot guys and girls. The actor that caught my eye was Steven Albrecht "Freddy", he is so hot. We get see him completely nude showing off his hot body.  He did a great job in his breif scene. Josh Edwards "Trian" was okay to look at too. As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot 
 Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story.  When I had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to DVD format, I was thrilled. And then I bought the DVD, and to my dismay, within the first couple of minutes into the movie, there were white lines and distortion. Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV. And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound. It's very harsh and nasally. I am on my way out the door to return this DVD and ask for a refund. 
 Al Norman, who is the "shill of the anti-Wal-Mart union movement," has just written yet another jealous screed against the retailer, since a few years ago he discovered he could make money by doing so.  The book trumps up a "case" against Wal-Mart by taking rare, isolated incidents that occurred (and were corrected) at certain stores and presenting them as day-to-day company policies. In this way, Norman ( as in "normal"?) is able to spout forth his generalizing "Wal-Mart is a big bad bully" mythology.   In place of Wal-Mart's "always lower prices" slogan, he presents the following kind of "evidence" to make the store look bad:   * Always forces its workers to labor "off the clock" without pay: lie - isolated incident; they are paid.  * Always uses overseas sweatshop labor to manufacture its clothing: lie - isolated Kathy Lee Gifford incident; no underage workers allowed.   * Always sells knock-off and counterfeit merchandise that misleads and confuses its customers: lie - sells brand name merchandise.  * Always destroys acres of environmentally sensitive lands to build new Wal-Marts: lie - for every acre of store land, another acre is donated to that same area by Wal-Mart. * Always eliminates competition in towns across the U.S. by illegally lowering prices below wholesale: lie - sells at least 10% above. * Always forces the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S.: lie - Wal-Mart doesn't manufacture anything, and makers are free to work where they want.  * Always calls "full-time" 28 hours per week: lie - at Wal-Mart, 30 hours or more is considered full time. (Although the lower the full-time designation, the quicker workers are entitled to full-time benefits.)  * Always pays wages so low that many of its employees qualify - and accept - welfare payments: lie - workers earn far above welfare levels, and by doing so couldn't qualify for welfare anyway.  * Always demands millions of dollars in tax breaks to locate in communities all over the U.S., while it earns billions of dollars in profits: lie - tax breaks were not invented by Wal-Mart - they apply for them if they can, like anyone else.  *Always ruins towns it goes into: lie - the store actually contributes far more in jobs, taxes, and in contributions to local charities than any other entity in those areas.   The book by Norman, the self-proclaimed leader of the "anti-sprawl" movement, goes Republican evangelical towards the "sinners" that tun Wal-Mart, and also towards those who shop there, calling for a "boycott" of the store. Where have we heard that before? That's right - in the boycotts by Germans against Jewish shops in the early days of the Nazi movement.  Strange how Norman and his labor union pals never seem to go after those retail chains who don't threaten their pocket books at the moment, on behalf of the "greater good" of the community. No, instead only the current top dog is going to find itself in Norman's sights, and right now that happens to be Wal-Mart. Before that it was Target, and before that K-Mart.   Whoever the current #1 is, that's exactly who Norman and company are going to chase after, because then he can sell his books, and the unions can hope that Wal-Mart finally caves in to their recruiting pressure, and signs up its workers with the old Jimmy Hoffa vanishing pension fund gang.   This is a book that every American shopper should read and laugh at heartily, before then making another trip to Wal-Mart and saving a big bundle of money, as usual. Are author Norman or his union buddies going to make up that loss in your wallet if you stop shopping at money-saving stores like Wal-Mart? No way!  So I can only advise you in this direction: "Friends don't let friends be fooled by union shills!"   (Book Rating: 1 star for stupidity - and general comedy value. 
 I didn't make it through the whole book, but still:  I found the examples that constitute the bulk of the book to be very poor. The main problems, I think, are that they don't really explain the design requirements and they don't give you a reason *why* anyone would be solving the problem in question. In some cases, I think they're solving contrived problems that no one would ever want to solve.  Consider the the factory pattern chapter. It's centered around a Pizza class that has methods such as bake(), cut(), and box(), and I have trouble imagining that anyone would want to make such a class -- maybe because baking, cutting and boxing seem to be inherently *physical* actions, whereas computers are generally involved in the *non*-physical. It might make *some* sense if they claimed they were trying to build a control system for a pizza-making robot, but I don't think they do. I doubt this pizza-making robot interpretation would make sense of the rest of their class hierarchy, but maybe.  In the introductory chapter, they discuss a hypothetical pond simulator, which simulates behaviors of various types of duck. This is more obviously something one might want to make on a computer, but they never give enough detail. What is this particular pond simulator designed to do, for instance? How does it work? How would the user interact with it? They have you analyzing a Duck class and its subclasses, which have methods such as quack(), swim(), display(), and fly(), and that would be all well and good, except they don't discuss when the simulator would call these methods, what their particular responsabilities are, or how they are to interact with the rest of the simulator.  Tangentially, I would add that I found the pictures of attractive women to be distracting 
 I found the first-person reviews interesting, but I was immediately turned off with the extensive Buddhist sources and useless psychology.  I DO have a situation with my mother who lives with me.  I need to deal with the lack of space and my Mother's obsessive need for keeping her possessions hidden. I understand her lack of possessions when she was young.  I needed more information on how to deal with someone who must live with me.  It is easy for all these women who aren't "in your face" caretakers and live apart.  This wasn't helpful for me at all 
 This is the WOOOOOOOOOOOORST Barbie movie I have seen in my life.It really STINKS!!!I also don`t like Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus,but I don`t hate it as much as I hate swan lake.

I don`t like the music.Some of the people in the hate reviews says that music ws scary.It`s not scary to me but I don`t like it!  OOH ANYWAY...THAT`S MY OPINION!! 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 I love south music like three 6, lil jon, master p, but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead. Man JD is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he can't get no one wit talent. every song on here sounds like it was hurried up. Fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick. 
    Dont get me wrong this book does teach you the basics and then abit more but, if you're like me and learn more visually then reading, then this book aint for you. This books artwork is real 80s work, ya know pointy face with messed up face features like eyes alittle to high or not portioned correctly, all old etc etc( even Dragon ball Z style looks better then these ). So that for one through me off I have little anime/manga experience and my artwork is far better then this one so I suggest buying How to draw manga volume one and not MORE how to do draw manga volume one ( which is just as good or better in the reading portion )For the older volume has a more Recent style and not an old style. Although this volume gives you info that should be needed in this catagory it just makes you feel like your drawings will end up turning out old and ugly, not something for ppl who are looking for a more recent drawing style. And Btw MHTDM Volume 2 has a more recent style so if you are planning on buying two, go for it 
 I had heard some good things about Lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago - but had bought another brand. This time around, with the good price on Amazon, I gave these Lenmar batteries a try. I ordered two ten-packs. Only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge. I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger, including diagnostics on batteries (voltage, etc., displayed for each battery).  None of these would charge 16 of the batteries - even in the 'recovery' modes available on the RipVan and LaCrosse. Returned the batteries to Amazon 
 I'm sorry, but this is horrible. I'm a big JSBX fan, but this CD has bad rhythm and completely unintelligible lyrics. They must have been on... Don't buy it. If you like music that's really weird on purpose, buy Pink  Floyd instead of this. You can get all their other CD's, but please not  this one!  I can't believe other people gave this a 5 star rating. They  must see the world a lot different 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

 One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately "Judge Dredd"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for "Future Shock" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  "Dredd" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much! 
 I own the entire "Captain's Table" series in paperback, and, like other reviewers, this book was my first brush with the only Star Trek series to have no strong ties with the TV series'--Peter David's "New Frontier".  I must say that if this story is a representative sample of what that series has to offer, I would advise others who might be considering taking a look at the series to read something else instead--perhaps one or two of Peter David's other novels, such as DS9's "The Siege" or Q-SQUARED.  These other novels are prime examples of what Peter David really does well: a subgenre I shall call Star Trek Horror.  "Once Burned" is horrifying too--but for its bloodthirsty captain, shallow plot, and air of foredoomed menace over Calhoun's whole experience, rather than for any genuinely scary experiences.  In my opinion, this is one to miss 
 Some may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why:  - scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story, 'plodding' is more accurate.   - caracatures over characters. A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill.   - virtually zero gain.  the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it's very boring and slow. However...  -... the book doesn't get good until the last fourth.  And that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series.   By this point, it's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'Armageddon', one of the best books in the series. How ironic.   Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant. It's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop. 
 Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books.   However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.     
 I was expecting this to be a fantastic book after reading some of these reviews.  I found this book to be a real struggle to get through.  It started off quite well but soon became quite boring. There were still so many unresolved issues in Faith's life by the end of the book that it really left you hanging. It shocked me when she revealed that she had not told anyone about the Homecoming incident. I just don't think that is realistic after what she went through. I would not recommend this book 
 Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad. Pages are falling out 
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 The author knows his stuff. And if I had NOT been familiar with spiritual writings (or self-help books) I might have gotten seduced by the 'logic' of the arguments or the promises for improving my relationships.   However.  To me, the emphasis of the presentation on the workings of the mind and spirit makes only more obvious its dissociation from the body and emotions. This book will help most people with their relationships the way yoga helps people to be flexible - through dissociation. In both cases a methodical disconnection from  the emotional markers held in the body creates a temporary sense of freedom and relief. But, these very markers hold in place personal history and uniqueness of one's life experience - not to mention energy trapped in suppressed emotions.   To say that I found this book pretty useless for me, is unfortunately not enough - I believe this book is dangerous in what it creates through its seductions - a sort of spiritual and emotional brain washing. Sure, it contains powerful techniques for change - so does brain washing. And. Dissociation works quite well at first - that's why people dissociate - because it works. But. Is this a choice I really want to make? No.  I don't doubt that Mr. Grayson has found a way to make the techniques in his book work for him. I also don't doubt that they worked for his clients - over time therapists polarize the clients they draw by the very nature of the approaches they refine. But. That doesn't make such an approach a good thing. The perspective which this book represents is not one I would choose for my own relationships - it would be insulting and hurtful to the people I love. I want to be close to the people I love, not float on a cloud of abstractions, basking in self-satisfied detachment. Neither would I want to attract into close relationships the kind of people this book would attract.  I'm 47 years old, married for 13 years, with two children. I am an illustrator-artist (27 years), organic grower (11years) and a licensed bodyworker (14 years). I've read spiritual writings and self-help books since I was 15, and until about 5 years ago. This book was recommended to me by a well-meaning, casual friend 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 In a "letter to the Editor" published in National Review Magazine of 3/24/89, I've already pointed out the blattant errors made by Mr. Winters in his article "They Shoot Allies, Don't They?"  published by the same magazine in its 11/25/88. Factual errors that he had  to recognize like: Ho Chi Minh was born in Hue, Thich Tri Quang was a  successful lawer, The HCM Trail was started in 1962, ... This book is a  development of that article and consequently the errors are even bigger.  Let's look at the book's most important question: Why did President Kennedy  wanted to replace President Diem, an ally of 9 years? To answer this  question correctly and completly, we have to look beyond Kennedy's  political ambition, beyond the election of 1964. To fully answer to this  question, Mr. Winters must also think of other questions: Why did the U.S.  support then stop the support to the Shah of Iran, Somoza, Noriega, Marcos,  ...? Beside other factors, the most important one is "THE WILL OF THE  PEOPLE" of Iran, of Nicaragua, of the Phillippines, of Vietnam. This  factor is totally absent from Mr. Winters' book. The only shadow of the  author's interest in the "people" is in the title of his book.  And I agree with the previous comentator that even "the year of the  hare" is, unknown to Mr. Winters, unapplicable to the Vietnamese. *  A  Vietnamese in Sacramento, California 
 It's not difficult to imagine the type of person who would still want this book, but one would prefer not to. Unfortunately it's still all too relevant. One wishes that Henry Ford's idea of history as "bunk" was more convincing!  The resurgence of opposition to the phoney "War on Christmas" should remind readers of earlier efforts to attack American Jews.   Hendrik Hertzberg, in a New Yorker article about the ongoing war on Christmas, made a direct connection to this book. He wrote:    ... Christmas itself, in something like its recognizably modern  ...  form, with gifts and cards and elves, dates from the early  ...  nineteenth century. The War on Christmas seems to have come  ...  along around a hundred years later, with the publication of  ...  "The International Jew," by Henry Ford, the automobile  ...  magnate, whom fate later punished by arranging to have his  ...  fortune diverted to the sappy, do-gooder Ford Foundation.  ...  "It is not religious tolerance in the midst of religious  ...  difference, but religious attack that they"-the  ...  Jews-"preach and practice," he wrote. "The whole record of  ...  the Jewish opposition to Christmas, Easter and certain  ...  patriotic songs shows that." Ford's anti-Semitism has not  ...  aged well, thanks to the later excesses of its European  ...  adherents, but by drawing a connection between  ...  Christmasbashing and patriotism-scorning he pointed the way  ...  for future Christmas warriors.         --- From "Bah Humbug" www.newyorker.com, posted 2005-12-1 
 Stephane Grappelli is one of my favorites, so it surprised me how lousy this CD is.  You'd think that he and Yo-Yo Ma would have really brought some sparkle to these songs, but they are performed in a leaden, almost folkie style.  Fortunately I didn't spend money on this.  A friend has a copy of the tape, which I popped into his car stereo one day recently.  After a few songs, we both agreed to turn it off.  In fact, my friend said that he had only listened to it once or twice years ago, and that he didn't like it then and that it hasn't improved with age 
 I am a lover of Japanese movies. I even purchased a masterpiece (Sadakan No. 8) for $50 for a VHS. I have a huge collection of Japanese jems.  So I know what I'm talking about. Heck I'm even Japanese myself :-)   But let me tell you--MABOROSI must mean MAJOR BORING..This movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring. Yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die...please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and Yumiko dreams about this repeatedly. Yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide. She mops throughout the movie from start to finish. She wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect. A totally unrealistic movie; in real life, Yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of. (her husband was some kind of laborer.)   THE MOVIE IS DREADFULLY BORING. BORING. BORING. BORING. It goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot. It goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy...   Masterpiece--HOW ON EARTH????? It's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good.   Now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this. It's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well! I'm not exaggerating.   If you decide to purchase this BORING movie, and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated, well, I warned you.   Thank you 
 This book starts off by praising the authors, and then does very little to justify it.  The authors create false categories of "bullies".  The book is riddled with contradictions that makes one wonder if it was actually edited.  The entire value of the book is that it does inform the reader that (1) bullies need to harm and control others, (2) that's just the way they are - don't try to understand them, and (3) do not suffer because there are ways to deal with it.  I suggest you find those ways in another book.  I was recommened "Jerks at Work. 
 I wish I could give Ms. Anderson a more favorable review as I am an avid long time student of metaphysical principles and was really looking forward to reading this book - I liked the catchy title.  However, I must admit that I really didn't find any new breakthroughs here or new suggestions to improve my 'field playing' skills.  I also didn't particularly care for the constant references to Ms. Anderson's career - I would have liked to hear more examples of other 'players'.  Although this is simply my personal perception, Ms. Anderson's style makes her come across as rather self-absorbed when it comes to her 'abilities'.  This book will most likely not become part of my permanent collection on quantum physiscs and the art of manifestation.  I will stick with the classics instead - James Allan, Neville, Abraham-Hicks, Grabhorn, Goldsmith, Dyer, Hawkins, F.A. Wolf.      
 Stephen Kern read a lot, writing his book. His study is a conglomerate of the most important authors, sociologists and philosophers focusing on the shift of time and space concepts in modern Europe. The broadness of his knowledge is the lack of his book, because it is nothing else than a masterwork of the superficial. Combine a little bit of time-philosophy in the novels of Proust, a little bit of brainstorming (Molly Bloom) in Joyce, combined with Einstein, James, Husserl (!), Bergson, Ibsen, etc. and you have a good pseudo-cultural-philosophic consomm. The book is mixture of articles you find in encyclopedias. I am very disappointed, especially with Harvard University Press.  
 These dudes are just plain awful. Only in the mediocrity of country music can they survive and make the charts. Some of the worst vocals that you will EVER here. Ronnie Dunn is one of the worst singers ever.  Nothing here as aweful as My Maria, but pretty bad stuff. The more my niece plays this crapola around me the sicker I ge 
 The underlying premise of this book (democracy = good, tyranny and slavery = bad) is obviously sympathetic. You can't go wrong with that these days, on a fundamental level.  What Hanson has done with this, though, is utterly inexcusable. He's taken every fact and twisted and tortured it until it fits so that each of the people surveyed can be painted in pure black and white, as unambiguous heroes and titans among men. It doesn't matter that Patton took over an army already on the verge of breaking a badly-battered German army, or that the reason Sherman was able to burn his away across the South was because Grant was going toe-to-toe with the only dangerous Confederate army in Virginia. No, in each case, Hanson's favorite guy was entirely responsible for victory, and he manages to twist the contributions of others into proof of their incompetance. It's like, you know, Grant was completely stalled out by Lee! He couldn't get anything done at all! Meanwhile Sherman was doing all the real damage! That Grant guy was a total loser. Or ... before Patton showed up, all the British and Americans were doing was uselessly battering themselves against the Germans! It took Patton's genius to achieve the breakout where those losers were just getting people killed and wasting time!  This stuff is beyond the pale, really. It's intellectually dishonest. It's not history. It's history twisted and tortured to support an ideological bias.  The shame of it is that this is a really interesting topic. Sherman and Patton anyway were real people, ambiguous and conflicted. Patton in fact was probably a nut (and even many of his fans would probably not disagree on this point), but he was a nut who could motivate troops. And I personally always do feel conflicted about what we've done and what has happened in fighting some nasty wars: the fireboming of Dresden, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Sherman's march to the sea, the genocide of the Native Americans, My Lai, and Abu Grahib. What I want is someone to really look into these things and tell my why free and democratic nations which claim to have strong principles do these things. I don't need someone telling me "it's OK, our society is great, it was all in rightous anger, it had to be done, and anyway, they were all bad guys. 
 This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone 
 I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year. I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.  Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...  No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend. Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids. 
 Uh, somehow I ended up thinking this would be compatible with my Canon iP5200R when Amazon was out of the regular cyan (CLI-8C) a little while back. Vaguely recall it even turning up when I searched Amazon for the printer's inks /the CLI-8C.  Just found out the CLI-8PC won't work as a substitute. Nope. Zero. Not compatible. A couple printers like the iP6600/iP6700D only.  Looks like Amazon's cleaned up whatever made the CLI-8PC come up prior for those searching for the CLI-8C and particular printer's inks. Now if Canon could put an explicit warning in CLI-8PC listings not to be silly and think "Photo Cyan" can be substituted for "Cyan".  (And oh. When I'm printing 95% black text, why the heck do all my expensive color inks get drained too? I thought I had the PGI-5Bk cartridge dedicated to that use alone, but that's another story. Does make me even more darn unhappy with buying this unnecessarily in the first place though. 
 The Images of America series features a wide range of topics by numerous authors. Some are quite good, others more mediocre, and a few are downright bad. This book falls at the lower end of the mediocre category.  The book covers only the area from Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom, stopping short even of Georgetown. Generally, those are the areas out-of-towners stick to on their vacations, so this book will be relevant to them. Thomas Carrier, the author, virtually ignores the rest of the city and metropolitan area.  Dates are provided only for some of the photographs and illustrations, lessening their value. Quixotically, many of the captions go on at length about some building, then say that the illustration depicts the site before all that happened - leaving out anything about what you're actually looking at. The illustrations are keyed to maps at the beginning of each chapter - that's fine, but no street address is provided in most of the captions, which would have been useful. There also are a great many statues illustrated - again, fine for tourists, but not having much to do with the life of the city.  One example of the book's lack of focus: On page 105 is a fine photograph of the Watergate band barge, a fixture of Washington life for several decades until the advent of loud jet planes forced its removal in the early 1960s; the nearby Watergate complex of the 1960s got its name from this location. The foreground of the picture shows dozens of canoes filled with people crowding close to the barge early on a summer evening. Steps for people to listen to the free concerts are still by the river today - for no apparent reason until one understands the original purpose. Yet Carrier's caption is concerned completely with Memorial Bridge, seen only dimly in the background. His only comment on the barge is it's a "floating band stand."   The absence of Carrier's understanding of social events and context and his focus on simplistic touristy features underscore the tone of the entire book. 
 This heating pad was received as a gift to replace the Sunbeam heating pad I had used for 35 years and had finally worn out. I was delighted with the larger size, but the new pad did not heat at all. I returned it to HoMedics (along with the $5 handling charge), and two months later they sent a replacement. The replacement heats up, but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted. It almost looks like it has melted to itself, and it can't be flattened out. I won't be sending this one back with another $5 handling charge--it isn't worth it. This one goes out with the trash, and I go back to Sunbeam. 
 If you're only used to more modern westerns, this one will kill you.  It's is almost shot in real time (meaning that they show the clock constantly, and it's as slow as the movie).  Sadly predictable by today's standards.  The notion is unique and brilliant, but the movie isn't entertaining.  It's borderline annoying.  I'm way off base compared to most reviews here, which is why I started out stating "If you're only used to modern westerns..." 
 The review on the cover of the DVD reads "A snappy, sexy thriller..." I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.  Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.   The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about 
 I am a huge Kevin Smith fan!  I have seen all the films multiple times.  The commentary tracks and the documentary materials are often as funny as the movies themselves, as Smith riffs on his cast and his own skills as writer and director. I also own "An Evening With Kevin Smith," a collection of his appearances on college campuses where he talks about his experience in the movie business and answers questions from the audience.  That DVD truly showcases Smith's wit and improvisational skills.  You would expect that a guy who is so naturally funny and capable of such extemporaneous clever banter with an audience would put out a book which would be a laugh a minute.  Not so.  First, the book is not truly "new" material.  It is a collection of essays he wrote for some magazine years ago.  Second, the presentation in this format of collected essays makes this an often disjointed read, as he skips to different subjects of varying interest.  Some essays, like casting info on Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back has its humorous moments, as does a funny rant against Reese Witherspoon.  At the other end of the spectrum, for example, there is an essay in which he defends the sincerity of the Lopez-Affleck relationship against critics, which only reinforces how clueless he was then about something everyone, not just the jaded critics, knew.  I hope in a few years, Smith will release a book similar to Howard Stern's "Private Parts" which will demonstrate how funny he is. Until then, this is a middling effort.        
 Not everyone will agree with me (I'm sure), but based on my own being a fifty-something male who is fighting Father Time as part of my never-ending quest to stay reasonably fit, I think that any book that purports to cover the subject of "fitness over fifty" needs to address the realities of what happens to the human body as it ages.  This requires more than a trivial reference to a few measurements of physical decline, including percentage loss of "VO2 max," it demands frank and full  discussion of what it actually means to be aging and yet trying to remain athletically active.    Here's the deal, like it or not: as we get older, we get more brittle, less flexible, more prone to gaining weight, and more prone to injuries, which in turn take longer to heal.  And on and on.  Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to be smart, prudent, and strategic in the way one approaches physical activities.    A good book on this topic would devote a great deal of its contents to these realities of aging, and would serve as a guide to avoiding injury, dealing with various kinds of soreness and other age-related physical issues, and addressing the *psychological* issues related to the realization that one's body no longer can do what once it did.    Instead, this book is, for the most part, just another general treatise on "beginning exercise," with but a very few comments that might be helpful to 50+ people in particular.  In fact, the first part of the book is actually counter-productive, in my opinion, as its message is essentially the old "inspirational" saw about how "age is only a number," etc.  Folks, this isn't true, and even the best-trained athletes over fifty years old will confess as much.    Most of the book is a slog through "how to begin" various sports, including running, swimming, cycling, and cross-country skiing.  This information may be useful for people who absolutely have never done any serious exercise, but these sections are addressed to a general audience, with practically no information that is of particular use to an "over fifty."    With so many people who have exercised one way or another getting older, there remains a crying need for a book that actually addresses the issues that aging athletes will encounter as the years go by.  As the old saying goes, aging isn't for cowards, it's a tough process that has to be addressed head-on, not sugar-coated and pep-talked out of existence.    
 This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original "ReAnimator" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks 
 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Lost Civilizations is just that....a guide for complete idiots.  Don't get me wrong, I purchased this book looking for an easy to understand, concise guide to lost civilizations; I wanted something to read to get a basic understanding before tackling more scholarly works.  I needed a framework.  The format of this book seems wonderful at that.  Easy and fun to read, I would recommend this book if it were not for the gross factual errors.  I am not an expert in lost civilizations, but after reading a text on both Greece and Rome, I found Ryan's book to be riddled with errors in these two sections, my favorite being the name of the first Ceasar....whose name happens to be Julius.  Ryan says its Octavian...well, he's almost right.  He's the second, taking the reigns from his adopted father Julius. This fact is not up for contention or debate; it's simply a fact..as is the information he got wrong about Cleopatra, Claudius, Nero, the five good emperors....Linear B. Since my knowledge is only basic and only covering two sections, I can only wonder at the misinformation piled into the rest of the book. Today I use this book as a way to study the ancient civilizations I have read about--by looking for errors in this book.  If you are looking for a concise history of lost civilizations,and want to be confident in the accurateness of your newly found knowledge--look elsewhere 
 18 May 2006  If I had read that the book was based primarily on those interviews, I might not have read this book. The authors really don't have deep insight of Google. Part of it could be because the company has guarded its privacy well. Still, for a book on Google, it is very disappointing as one can probably find out more juicy information about Google by using the search engine itself :-).   Appendix II has a copy of the Google Labs Aptitude Test, complete with Test Code. It is nice to see that, though I think I would have failed the test and therefore has no chance of working for Google :-). 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 This book won't help you at all.  I don't even want to give it a star.  I would recommend The lilaguide: Baby Gear Guide and Baby Bargains 
 I love Prince, but this is his weakest album to date. Prince actually played some AMAZING shows with Chaka Khan and Larry Graham in support of this album, and he also had complete artistic control making it; knowing this makes NEW POWER SOUL all the more disappointing. It sounds musically uninspired - a lot of Prince's trademark moves are here, the multi-track vocals, the nice licks, risque lyrics, etc. and the production is pretty smooth, but the final result sounds languid. In fact, compared to 1996's EMANCIPATION or 2001's RAINBOW CHILDREN (two better examples of his post-Warner Bros. work), NEW POWER SOUL sounds pretty boring.  "New Power Soul", "Mad Sex", and "Push It Up" have their moments, but they fizzle out quickly. The single "Come On" is the best upbeat tune/jam on this album, but after that first chorus, the funk doesn't hold up. There's some rudimentary bottleneck guitar to shake things up, but it comes off pretty weak. The other single, "The One," did better on the charts, but not enough to be called a 'hit,' not even a modest one; compared to "Adore" or MUSICOLOGY's "Call My Name," "The One" sounds really weak.  The one track worth your time is "Wasted Kisses." It's a hidden track - you have to skip past a whole bunch of blank tracks to track #49 to hear it - and it's a fine ballad. Easily the best thing here by a wide margin, if iTunes's online store ever sells it, I'd get it instead of buying the whole CD.  Luckily, a LOT of people seem to be selling this disc used for $1, so if you find a cheap copy, consider getting it for "Wasted Kisses," but don't pay much more for it. 
 I've bought the book as text for a writing class I'm taking and have to agree with the couple of folks who didn't like it.  "Severely bloated" was a good phrase.  There's just too much rambling to hold my interest.  It's a shame because, like the others said, there are some very good points and exercises to the book, definitely things to be learned by reading it.  But much of the important information gets lost in the midst of all the blather.  Between the book and the class, I hope to learn something, but it will be more a more painful process than necessary 
 I would give this product negative 50 stars if I could.   I paid beaucoup for several very plain bras (no lace or other embelishments) and didn't wear or wash the bras until I received the BraBaby.  I assumed the BraBaby would protect my bras in the wash, as that's what the product claims to do. Imagine my suprise when I pulled my bras out of the washer (and out of their respective "Bra Demolition Cages") to find them RUINED.  I'm talking not wearable.   The straps of both brand new, never worn, previously mint condition bras were hanging out all over the place and looked like they had been chewed by an animal.  Both bras had dents in the molded cups.  Then I saw that one of the bras had two noticeable rips on the cup!  I nearly flipped out!   I think my bras would've been better "washed" had I thrown them into the center of a pack of rabid fighting mad dogs.  The only positive thing to report is that Amazon refunded my money.   Back to hand washing my bras and back to the mall I go to replace the ripped bra.  Perhaps the other with it's dented cups will be suitable for Halloween?  
 Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest.  This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.  This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the "cherished myths debunked" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.  Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as "peacenik", "peace offensive", and "red diaper baby."  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.  Strange...  Hey, some books should best be left to the pros.  Simple as that 
 This volume is disappointingly lightweight. Notwithstanding the comment of another reviewer who allegedly spent several evenings reading it, one can easily read it in 2 hours or even much less. The pages have relatively few lines of text, and those lines are widely-spaced. Almost 30% of the book (55.5 pages out of 190, other than intro and index) is filler, comprising biographies repelete with photos of the chapter authors in their Formula 1 racecars, running in a triathlon, rubbing their dog's belly, etc., and lots of information about their hobbies, or else pages that are completely blank but for brief epigrams by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain and Herman Melville.  The substantive focus is almost exclusively on patents, with a dash of trade secrets thrown in. On the plus side, writers from IBM, HP and Intel have good stuff to say about licensing strategies. But the book doesn't say much about the strategic side of building a portfolio -- e.g., you won't find any mention of designing around, the doctrine of equivalents, walls, fences or flooding. Many of the articles exalt the delights of suing people. The authors voice opposing views about patent trolls, but the discussion is surprisingly black and white, with little nuance (e.g., no discussion about whether there should be different remedies for different sorts of patent owners).   A frequent refrain throughout the book is that up to 80% of many companies' value is in IP and intangible rights. But actually, good luck trying to get 80% of your market cap by selling off your IP portfolio. In the context of this book, the statistic is misleading in several respects. First, the percentage is based on the gap between the market capitalization of a company and the book value of its tangible assets.  Much of the value in this gap is in goodwill and brand, i.e. trademarks and related rights, which aren't discussed in this book at all. Second, the debate over whether market cap accurately reflects fundamental value would fill many books the length of this one. Lastly, the valuation of patents is especially context-dependent. A patent's value can only be determined by  licensing or selling it to someone else, or by using it in litigation. For most companies (trolls aside), only a small percentage of their patents will ever be litigated. It's hard to predict which ones those will be, and even harder to predict the financial outcome of the case. And the percentage that are licensed is usually well under a majority (and in many cases is zero). All these issues complicate the attribution of value to patents. But aside from some brief discussions of patent quality in one or two chapters, you won't find such issues grappled with in this book.  The three or four best articles, such as the one by M. Phelps about IBM's licensing program, are way too short and general to give you much guidance on how to implement a strategy at your company. They're like tantalizing hors d'oeuvres -- whereas the book is priced like a full meal (or a very fancy entree, at least). As for the balance, there are plenty of websites and blogs where you can get articles of comparable depth and insight for free. So buy this book used, or read it in a store. A meatier book about patents generally, including portfolio strategy, is Knight's "Patent Strategy for Researchers and Research Managers"; and about licensing programs, a pretty good choice is Parr and Sullivan's "Technology Licensing: Corporate Strategies for Maximizing Value." You may spend more on those, but they're much better value for the price. 
 For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it 
 I was looking forward to using what I learned from this book to implement balanced scorecard strategy with my small business clients.  There is so little useful information, I didn't even finish reading the book.  The last chapter and appendix are literally the only portions I found helpful.  Look elsewhere 
 The story (what I read of it) was okay, but the language was so bad that I skipped over about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book.  I was interested in how it turned out, so I read the ending.  It was only semi-satisfactory 
 Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one

 Well, this game... I mean, this movie is about... there are a group of... sorry. Don't waste your time. Nothing to see. Even my boy, after seen the movie, decided to put the game on the shelf, without finishing it 
 Wow.  I thought because OK Computer was such a good album this book would probably be pretty good.   But then I read it.  The writing is so stale and unemotional that the author is unable to actually articulate what the album means to anyone.  Instead, she uses chords and stupid bpm graphs to talk about the songs and othing about their emotional weight.  Plain and simple, This book SUCKED don't waste your money on it.  Buy the one on Let it Be by the Replacemnts instead 
 Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.   All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that "Dar es Harb" does not deserve its prosperity and "Dar es Salam" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.   "the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan"  This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.   Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade  about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.  His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.   If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky.  
 I rely on customer reviews when deciding on a book. Apparently the three reviews I read that appeared to be helpful turned out to be a  disappointment. This book is obviously written for someone with a very  extensive vocabulary. It is filled with $10.00 words and ideas that are  really hard to decipher. I was under the impression, via the other 3  reviews, that this book would provide an explanation of  "mindblindness" in terms the average layman could understand.   After reading the  first two chapters, I had to go back and read them again  and again. I suggest you try to find this one at the public library before  you decide to permenantly add it to you own personal collection. Save your  money and the shipping charges 
 This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  I got this album for my birthday as I was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music.  I have albums of Metallica,Queens of the Stone Age, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Korn, Slipknot and Disturbed that I like, but Sepultura's Against is a joke.  The first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm.  Afterwards, it just goes downhill.  Every song seemed to mimic the next, with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from Derrick 'The D!*$' Green.  Sepultura were a much better band with Max Cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth. All of my friends (who are metal heads) agree with me 100% that this is Sepultura's WORST album.  Totally dreadful.  After 10 minutes of flicking through each song, I had to stop it, take it out and throw it out the window.  My advice: AVOID 
 I was hoping for a yoga book with pictures that allows me easy and safe postures -- maybe modified -- of the standard beginner yoga. Instead I got pictures - a book full of them -- of people lying on the floor on their backs sleeping. Waste of a book 
 I'm not all that familiar with Kellerman's work since I try to stay clear of serial character novels. But my wife, a Kellerman fan, bought the book and suggested I read it.  While the pace was mostly okay, two things really bothered me about this book. First is that the author is obsessed with wardrobe. He feels the need to exhaustively describe what many characters wear in each scene down to the last stitch! But the thing that I was most unhappy with is that Kellerman does what I don't recall seeing an author ever do. He walks away from the book. Just ends it with no conclusion! It's as if he decided he wrote the required amount of pages and said, "Well, that's it!" and sent it off to the publisher. Two big no-no's for a writer 
 I was thoroughly unhappy with Fort in "My Lady Notorious."  I was not especially excited to read about him in "Something Wicked," but the reviews were promising.  I should have stuck with my first instinct.  This book was incredibly boring.  I found most of it to be about the plot against the king.  I prefer not to have a whole lot of subplots in my romance novels.    Fort was not a likable hero.  He sired two children out of wedlock and only supported them financially.  What a jerk!  I don't care if that was how things worked in the mid-18th century - I prefer my heroes to be a little more noble than that.  Elf bordered on desperate.  Fort didn't deserve the attention or pursuit she afforded him.  I think Fort should have realized his folly and pursued Elf.  He was the jerk all along and should have been the one to lose his pride and pay the price.  Fort thoroughly debauches Elf and her brothers barely batted an eye.  It seemed out of character for all of the Mallorens.  And speaking of out of character, where was Elf's spunk?  She became a doormat and showed very little backbone in dealing with Fort.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have commented on this book's sizzle.  I have to say - I completely disagree.  There were only a couple of sex scenes and they were short and very undetailed.  If you are someone who likes vague, veiled sex scenes, this book's for you.  The ending seemed abrupt and a disappointing ending for such a long, drawn-out story.  I wouldn't waste my time with this one 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 Dreadful. A beautifully written piece of nothing. I suppose there was a story in there somewhere, but the layers of impression and nuance and deliberate disorientation thoroughly destroyed any plot there may have been to begin with. I actually suspect that there was no plot to this novel, if it can even be called such. As prose, 'tis written well. As a novel, however, it blows.  Consoled myself afterwards by reading the far superior The Remains Of The Day again 
 As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!! 
 I bought Trawler because I had read O'Hanlon's previous books, Into the Heart of Borneo and No Mercy, and so thoroughly enjoyed them, I could hardly put them down.  By contrast, Trawler was such a huge disappointment, I could hardly bear reading it until I finally put it down for good without finishing it.  It's full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of Moby Dick, but without Melville's nuance or complexity.  Instead, we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated "facts" that we might expect from someone in a drug-induced state, who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance.  It's perhaps telling that early on, O'Hanlon admits that "months after the contract was signed," he still owed his publisher a book.  Trawler ought to serve as a reminder not to let term papers go unwritten until the night before they're due 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars 
 I did not wish to rate this book with a star but had to enter something...  Can someone tell me why the reviews for this book are identical to the reviews for a different cheesecake cook book "I Love Cheesecake"? I was just reading the reviews for the other book and then planned to compare to the reviews for this book and they're exactly the same reviews??? makes me wonder why I should even bother with reading any of the reviews on this site...and if I should buy any of the books since I cannot tell which one is a good book 
 Interesting speculation of potential future events.  Some are way out such as the prediction of a major asteroid hit.  Others are likely, such as his note that nuclear energy will likely return in response to global warming fears.  What spoiled it for me was his calling the US a "rogue superpower".  He clearly understands we were attacked on 9/11 and notes that Al Qaeda is a "rogue enemy", but does not believe we have the right to protect ourselves by taking the war overseas to our enemy.  His first book, "Art of the Long View" was more informative 
 It's an interesting time if you are a cartoon lover.  We now have CGI playing an ever-increasing role in the genre and if indications of the success of "Chicken Little" and "Cars" is anything to go by, it looks like 2-D images like we get here are on the way out pretty soon.  I guess as we already have quite a decent Spider-man out on CGI, it's only a matter of time before all cartoons including the DC characters get onto the bandwagon as well.    As for this disc, I was pretty disappointed.  Although the sound quality was pretty good, the storyline is pretty lame and the overall running of the movie was just too short to do justice (pun intended) to the development of each character's "secret origins."  In fact, we only get to see Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter's origins unless they are talking about the origin of the Justice League in which case, what's so secret about that?  Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, we have virtually nada on the Special Features side of things.  All in all, quite a high price to pay for a dvd that barely runs over an hour and with little bonus features.  
 I bought this book with a lot of expectations.  However it turned out to be 200 pages of anecdotes, which lose their charm after the first twenty pages.  If I had followed the carnal rule of reading the contents list  before buying a book, I would not have made this mistake.  I admit there is  a good book scattered somewhere in those 200 pages.  But the author has to  pay better attention to the organization.  He could recount the same  anecdotes under a thematic framework based on the principles of marketing 
 During a $20 Tarot reading at a Spirituality exhibition, the very un-insightful Tarot reader (who told me nothing significant about my future), recommended this book to me. But I did not buy this book on her recommendation, why would I? She was awful. It was my Mother, who is everything new age and spritual (and the reason why I was at the exhibition in the first place), who bought the book and suggested I read it.  There is nothing profound about this book, in fact if i follow just one of this Authors suggestions, such as talking to every stranger that i lock eyes with (because apparently they have a message for me) not only would i not get anything done, but I would probably be dragged off to the nearest hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. A spotlight reviewer gave this book 5 stars as a comedy, good on him, for seeing the brighter side of this book 
 I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head 
 I read a lot of books and I must say that this one was hard to read. It's very repetitive and talks about the same things over and over again.   I was extremely dissapointed. Expected more from the Bio of one of the richest men in the world 
 Sternhell brings no new news, as Hertzberg correctly states above, just his spin on the already known facts.  Sternhell is one of the gang of 'new historians' and as such brings the already debunked 'original sin' libel to the table again.  This is tiresome and repetitive 
 My 2 1/2 year old son received this as a gift for Christmas - he loves Bob the Builder and we have a few other videos. In this story, Scoop becomes a egomanical paranoid freak, which my son finds confusing and upsetting. There are a few scenes where the machines argue and "camera" zooms in on close-ups of angry machine faces. This he finds very upsetting and yells for me to fast forward. It sends a terrible message to young children- that someone can treat their friends (co-workers, whoever) very badly, and then at the end, when that person messes up and needs help, is easily forgiven and it is all shrugged off.  In addition, the foreign accents assigned to some characters are ridiculous and almost offensive (and again, confusing to my son) and the yodeling is a virtual nightmare. It is just so sad that HIT Entertainment did not produce a storyline with more empathetic characters, and involve more learning. It is a total waste 
 I was so excited about this product; but when I got it I was deeply dissatisfied.  The box was damaged.  It was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides.  I will be returning this product for a replacement.  I do think that the box is really cute.  However if I receive another damaged box then I will never buy another thing from this website 
 I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.  The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.  Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
 Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that.  And this was the Michael Glenny translation 
 The book we received was not the full book with the ISBN number we ordered. It was volume one of two with a different ISBN number, which was clearly noted on the back of the book. We had to send the book back AT OUR EXPENSE 
 This book does not provide enough examples, and the few they do give are nothing like the work problems. Every teacher I've had has said if they were not required to use it, they would use a different book. And on top of that, it is ridiculously expensive!  I have finally been forced to get another text book, and it is much better (and cheaper). Do not get this book if you have a choice 
 As usual it is not what you expect. I was looking for the song played in the movie trailer at the end where a women sings the lyrics, "breath, just breathe". It is not in this soundtrack. Does anyone know where to find that song 
 This collection of short prose pieces was originally published in the _New Orleans Time Picayune_ in 1925; however, I'm not sure that Faulkner would be entirely pleased that they have been re-exposed to the light of day.   The writing is rough, even amateurish, and the story lines of the pieces  are often trite and stock.  But in spite of the general weakness of the  writings, there are thematic elements and character types in the pieces  that would reappear in Faulkner's mature writings.  What is absolutely  amazing is that just two years after the publication of these mediocre  writings, Faulkner had published two novels and was deeply involved in the  creation of his masterpiece, _The Sound and the Fury_ 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 Where to begin? The fact that the information about the countries is scant, or that you SIMPLY SHOULDN'T BUY THIS BOOK! Hey Rick, ever heard of Nice? You know, the second largest city in France? How about ROME?!?!?! Hm, guess not. Now it would be one thing if your definition of a "back door" was smaller, less traveled cities. Yet somehow London and Paris are in here. If you really want to get a comprehensive travel guide, look no further than the Let's Go! guides. They are concise, informative, and umptine MILLION times more useful than ol' Ric 
 This book is one of those highly detailed tomes on how to play the upright bass that is so complicated with music notation that no one in their right mind could ever learn from it. This book is only good for the very young who have infinite amounts of time and energy to devote to its study 
 I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his 
 My cat hates it,,i think he is scare  of it,,the first time he saw it he was curious  like any cat would be but once it was built all he did was go in ,smelled it and left .HE NEVER PLAYED IN IT AT ALL, i hated all those people that said to me that thing was fun for all cats.Its a lie,,that thing was out in the middle of the room for weeks and he never showed interest in it.He likes other toys like feather teasers and chew on toys,maybe thats why.The thing is so light that when i tried putting him on top of it ,it seemed that thing was going to break,,it was sinking in because of the weight of my cat.My cat got scared probably thinking it wasn't going to hold him and the minute i let go of him he took off running to hide.HORRIBLE.WASTE OF MONEY 
 Where's the emotions and motivations for this contorted mess? Great camera work and suberb dramatic talent wasted on a plot that defies logic 
 Nothing is clear in this book, it is not organized and not well writing. Filled with charts that are dispersed wherever and not easy to understand.  Frankly it is an advertising of the Investor Business Daily, IBD, please subscribe and you will make money, I lost my respect to Mr. O'Neils when he ended the book by the testimonials from Investors. He even wrote if you deal with a broker who didn't attend his class!! It is a worst investor. 
 Based on some good reviews, I made an attempt to read this book, but I am giving up halfway through.  I can't follow the plot and the Lara character is not believable at all 
 I purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy.  I could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke.  I threw it away.  It is a piece of junk 
 While I've had the pleasure of hearing Don Campbell speak, his information is, sadly, quite flawed. As others have rightly noted, the "science" in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music. The fact that he also copyrighted the term "Mozart Effect" is also deplorable. Finally, this type of book is responsible for placing music and sound on the backburner at many research institutions as it falsely implies that the use of music and sound belongs to "new age" nonsense. As a rule, I cringe when I see that someone else has used this book as a reference to back up other poor research. 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 This vacuum was highly rated by Consumer Reports and at $99.00( reconditioned )seemed a good buy.  It arrived by U.S. Mail very poorly packed with chunks of styrofoam all over the inside of the box.  Upon assembling I noticed it was missing the attachment tubes and when turned on the brushroll didn't work.  In addition, the finish was marred and smudged.  I sent it back and ordered a Hoover Windtunnel 2.  It works well and appears to be of higher quality 
 Unlike many people it seems, I've never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker -- it's still sturdy for me after about 8 uses.  However, the fact that I've owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself. This waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles. I've NEVER  been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles I've had in restaurants.  After trying over half a dozen different recipes, I realized that it wasn't my ingredients -- it was the waffle maker. This waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be -- crispy on the outside, chewy and moist on the outside.  Instead, no matter what recipe I used, or how long I cooked the waffles for, I would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness (if they had any to begin with!) within moments of leaving the waffle maker.  The model doesn't burn the waffles, the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking, and overall the waffle maker is nice looking. But that's all it has going for it. I've learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances, you get what you pay for. 
 Would not install drivers on Windows Vista Laptop. Linksys wont support this either and blew me of 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions 
 The Botti trumpet is excellent, however it has to fight with  monotonous, uninspired, drum work and assorted background that is overwhelming the clear, beautiful notes of Botti.  The vocals are ghastly. The crew on this CD needs to listen to some Henry Mancini arrangements; they could learn something about instrumentation 
 Hit and Run is a typical rock bio, full of the cliches and inaccuracies that we can expect from an uncreative person trying to write about, in this case, a truly creative person.  Hopkins takes a person who is publicly known due to talent, work, and accomplishment and reduces him to a fashion plate without a real job mindlessly indulging in the trends and vices of his time.  The author predictably hops from one conspiciuous milestone to the next with little insight into the music and even less into the man.  This book shows how short-form rock journalism extended to biography is an injustice to a significant artist who deserves a better profile.  Fortunately this artist already has in such books as Black Gold, Crosstown Traffic, and others 
 "The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outside Changed Baseball" delivers better on the first part of the title.    The book serves as a narrative biography of James, who is best known for popularizing a term he coined, "Sabrmetrics" or the use of statistics to analyze all facets of baseball decisionmaking, from which minor league pitchers would have solid major league careers to the value of stolen bases.  While it summarizes James's most important ideas, it really doesn't explore how they've impacted the Major Leagues at all, even though James is now a paid consultant to the Red Sox and his ideas clearly play a role.  Gray's sources seem to be limited to James's writings (which are mostly out of date) and interviews with James.  He really doesn't seem to have talked at all with other baseball executives to get their views on James's methods, and therefore its really difficult to know how seriously those truly "in power" take them.  For instance, Billy Beane of the A's is known to use Jamesian methods and done quite well with them (see Michael Lewis's "Moneyball").  Gray doesn't seem to have talked with him or other GMs though.   Another disappointment is the cursory coverage Gray gives some of James's most important ideas, such as the concept of "Win Shares" that allows players to be evaluated over different periods of time, i.e. did Yogi Berra or Jackie Robinson contribute more to their teams' success?  Calling the concept too complicated to really break down, Gray doesn't even get to it until about 2/3 of the way through the book.  One of the reasons for this is a real weakness of the book - its use of a narrative format instead of a topical one.  Because the book takes James from childhood to the presdent and discusses his ideas as he wrote them, there's no sense of hierarchy, i.e., which of them are most important in terms of their contribution to baseball, which is the book's ostensible purpose.  Finally, the book doesn't really take a comprehensive look at the world of baseball analysis to get a sense of how much ground James really broke.  The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) preceeded James's appearance onto the scene.  To what extent did James popularize work being done already (James can write clearly and make the mundane fascinating) and to what extent did he plow new ground?  Again, while the book acknowledges that there was this universe of research and analysis before James, he doesn't even begin to explore this.  None of this is to criticize James at all, who best exemplifies someone who writes about the game with intelligence and passion.  His ideas are important (whether you agree with him or not), and deserve a better explication than this volume.  In short, a good concept poorly executed in my view 
 Maybe i'm being shortshighted, but i feel as if the many concessions i already have to make with this disease are hard enough to incorporate into my daily life, without also including such intense dietary changes.  I work full-time, including travel and client entertainment making it very difficult to always control every morsel i consume.  also, don't share the author's background and early diagnosis symptoms.  Mine are coming more slowly and i am entrusting my treatment and long-term care to my Rheumy.  Sort of wish I had spent the money on a good yoga or meditation tape instead 
 The author doesn't inform, or define or back up her opinions at all in this "book". She just makes wild claims, spins already twisted facts and rants 
 What the heck? this band as chanced and not in a good way, do not waste your money on this because if you do you be will sorr 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 This was a novel I just couldn't get into, so much so I gave up and never finished it. It's well written from a technical standpoint and a clever idea but the middle portion of the book didn't hold my interest. The book is divided into 3 distinct parts. In the first, a mining vessel is converted into a craft capable of leaving the solar system by Americans and Russians who don't agree with the governing body in charge of Mars. Their way of getting out from under an oppressive regime is to find somewhere else to live. It is written from the point of view of a female scientist who helps them convert their ship but doe not go with them. Emma Weil returns to Mars to fight in the revolution to save her home of Mars.  The second part takes place more than a century later with an archaeologist trying to disprove the government version of what happened when the rebellion was stopped. This part of the book lost me. The archeologist is not a likable character and nothing happens. Talk, talk, talk, talk. People reminisce, they argue, they pontificate, they ruminate, they make plans, they remember, they regret but nothing really happens. I tried to push myself through because I wanted to know what Icehenge was, but eventually I just lost interest 
 Poor sound quality, not professionally prepared.  Some bits and pieces of a Sinatra live performance but hardly worth listening to unless you're a die-hard fan that cannot get enough of Sinatra 
 This book is not completely without merit, but it's really one of those books that should have been damned with faint praise & allowed to slink off quietly & die.  I feel my primary responsibility here is to debunk Spider's slavish blurb praising this...novel.  And yes, it's supposed to be `funny,' & quite possibly supposed to be bad SF-if so, it's a success on some levels anyway.  Terry Pratchett fans may enjoy it, those of us who enjoy our `funny' novels a little more `funny' may be annoyed.  So:  1)	Heinlein wouldn't have loved it.  For SF published in 2001, the science sucks: a crime is committed, a crime for which no expense is spared in finding the thieves, flakes of skin are left behind at the scene, yet in this far future of space ships & psychic powers (which a few pages before they are introduced are pooh-pooh as bad science fiction), no one apparently is capable of analyzing DNA.  The discussion of radio-isotope dating shows no understanding of either current techniques (which it explains ham handedly), nor how the technology might evolve over thousands of years.  There's lots more. 2)	It's not so much like Heinlein's work that you might think he wrote it.  I have read every good work of Heinlein's (many several or dozens of times), and most of the crap he produced after he lost it.  This doesn't read like good Heinlein or even senile, sex obsessed old Heinlein, not even the page we are given that is `such a good forgery even the experts were still debating its authenticity after 4 years,' bares the slightest resemblance to anything he could or would have written.  It's bad.  It's just plain bad. 3)	Spider Robinson lost my respect a long time ago.  When he started out he was a Canadian hippy with his own voice, who also wrote damn good SF reviews & happened to like Heinlein a lot.  I read all of his reviews for years, and bought many good books based on them, I also bought his first several novels, which verged on brilliant, and possessed many of the qualities he assigns this minor piece of trash.  But then RAH got sick, and people started rightly questioning particularly the sexism of some of his works (and taking nothing away from his literary accomplishments, which are impressive) & then he died.  At this point, for reasons only Spider can say, Spider lost it.  He wrote diatribes defending Heinlein that while providing much good evidence in Heinlein's favor, made the serious mistake of ignoring the mounds of evidence that also supported his opponent's positions.  Additionally, & much more damningly, his own work changed over the course of a novel or a novel and a half into a third rate pastiche of Heinlein that magnified his faults, and left almost everything that does give RAH resonance & poetry & power far behind.  I stopped reading him, and his opinion stopped matching anything that fit into my reality. 4)	Lastly, though I'm sure both Robinson & Janifer will deny any malfeasance, the fact that both Spider's name & the name of his most famous character occur on the first page of the novel, strikes me as quid pro quo of the most bald faced kind.  This is not a horrible novel.  It's vaguely funny.  It's mildly interesting.  But it's no Robert Heinlein, nor is it funny as, say, Douglas Adams.  But it's not horrible. 
 This is a short review because when you've heard one of these you've heard them all.  They're all played in the same starched, stiff mannor, with brisk tempi, little feeling, no shaping of phrase, and no color.  The Mozart symphonies--the latter ones, anyway--have their own style and merit different approaches (No. 31, the "Paris," is almost curtain-raiser music for an opera buffa, for example, while No. 39 is in some ways proto-Beethoven, harmonically sharing a good deal with the "Eroica," and No. 40 shows Mozart heading into a realm of a basically Romantic chromaticism that would have led to much fascinating music if he'd lived longer and written more in that style).  Yet here all the works are played interchangably.  These are performances that could have been generated on a computer.  The sound is excellent, but that's about all there is to recommend this set.  Hogwood's traversal on period instruments has more personality, believe it or not.  And to really show what can be done with works like these on HIP instruments, try Franz Bruggen's remarkable recordings of the Haydn symphonies on Philips.  I can't recommend this set, and I got it for considerably less than the Amazon price, too.  
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 Does D.S. know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended. I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.  Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.  I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire 
 First off, if you are going to write this genre, then recognize that there are people out there who know weapons, know the law and know unarmed combat. This books fails in all of those details.  It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the "evil" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.  Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.  There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.  And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?    Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.  This plot was terribly predictable 
 I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore.  Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so!  Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring.  Was this a mystery?  I don't remember much of a plot at all.  Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts.  Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?  Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable.  For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 i thought that this book is definately written in the age of ignorance. the idea of a race of people that is so isolated at the time hits home for me. my family is one of the "MAYLE" clan, so to speak, and this book was appauling. granted it gave some of the factual events and information but at the same time the author did not give accounts of the people themselves. it was treated as if this was an experiment. he should have gotten ALL of the facts before he wrote. some of the people that the author wrote about are actually native american (cheroke and pittsburg blackfoot). they were neither white or black and never really claimed to be either. as being a mayle myself, this book is a real dishonor to our family and all of our ancestors that delt with the same ignorance. 
 I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here. From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time.  "The Hand" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody. "Equilibrium" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin. But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces 
 I had to wait so long to get this book! The seller did not reply to any of my emails and did not notify me about the shipment 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 It's very true that Bennett's prose is full of wonderful, vivid and often ironic commentary.  This book gives you a great sense of place to the "five towns" (based on the six towns that would become Stoke-on-Trent) from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth.  Detail is exactly right for time and place.  That makes it a rather interesting read.  However, there's next to no forward motion to this book. Two sisters lead divergent lives-- the beautiful one runs off with a hapless commercial traveler to Paris.  The dutiful one stays home, manages the shop, and marries the clerk.  But that's about it for drama.  Both sisters grow older, have some not very interesting stuff happen to them, then meet up again after a long time and end their lives together.  OK, Sophia, the beautiful one, does survive the siege of Paris, and become a manager/proprietress of a well-run pension. But somehow even this lacks drama.  Bennett is often praised for how well he wrote his women characters.  I disagree.  They are well observed it's true, and some of his projections about what they might feel-- when Constance, the dutiful one, faces "empty nest syndrome" so mournfull, for example-- are accurate.  But he imagines no real complexity for them.  Both women are extraordinarily passive in most ways.  The men in the book occupy far less time but manage to seem more human.  Compare and contrast JANE EYRE:  on the surface a rather prim, direct governess-- but as Bronte writes her, she has a passionate, vibrant beating heart.  In Bennett's world, women don't particularly long for sex nor care about it, nor think much about attachment at all.   I think it's very telling that Bennett was inspired by the sight of an older woman in a restaurant.  It was not a woman he knew, but a woman he saw.  He imagined everything else about her.  If the time and place is enough to draw you in, then this book certainly does have that, as the 600-something pages sprawl about 50 years.  But if you like a good narrative, apart from "people get older," look elsewhere.  The writing is very good, but although Bennett's often compared to Balzac and Zola, he lacks their punch-- and I also think, essentially lacks their heart 
 my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the "boy band" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost 
 Written from a kid whose family was too poor to pay tuition and had to get loans, no wonder she only has bad stuff to say. Bad book. Bad writer. She should be ashamed that a fine education was given to her and this is what she did with it. The story is stupid and totally made up. Too bad the popular girls are still laughing at her 
  This book is long and boring account of an intelligence officer who served as director of mossad. I was expecting inside details of mossad operations instead author details how he personally contributed to some major breakthroughs in Middle East peace process. The account of details is ridden with narcissism and vanity. All in all not a good read 
 I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.  It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.  My instincts would have been correct.  An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.  The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.  I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.  Though I will say I was amused by the last line 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 The Great Wave is what results when someone who does not have any understanding of economics writes economic history.      The author's attempt to equate increases in prices due to catastrophic harvests or plague three to five hundreds years ago with the increase in general prices during the twentieth century to an expansionary monetary policy manages to, at once, understate what has been best about human progress and overstate what has been worst about it. 
 Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.  
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 This is a piece of junk--don't bother. when I originally ordered thought it was Bally's with the Balls at the end. This is just rope with pulleys. Not even elasticized. And really, when you return and have to pay postage, you are paying for the item and getting nothing 
 Please don't get me wrong. I am a HUGE Dan Simmons fan. I am an avid fan of his Hyperion series and I am waiting with serious anticipation for a movie series to unfold. While reading Ilium, I fell in love with the slightly dorky Hockenberry and the glorious Orphu and Mahnmut, worrying and fretting about their outcomes in this finale...  I was SO disappointed. This is just not Mr. Simmons' best writing. At BEST this is a melange of notes, maddeningly short chapters that jump from one subplot to the next (you literally have 5 or 6 subplots with an added one or two thrown in in the last 100 pages just to tick you off). Then, when you are heading for that all critical showdown with the antagonists (of which there are a minimum of 4 major and a whole slew of minors including Helen of Troy), you get NOTHING. I mean, there IS no showdown. The horrific Setebos and his evil sidekick Caliban (who was supposed to be THE bad one in Ilium)...Well, let's just say that Nada, zip and "What the He**!!" were my thoughts and exclamations. It was just awful. You get some seriously disturbing scenes like semi-necrophilia/rape the stasis patient (a la Kill Bill Part 1) which frankly, leave a bad, stinky, taste in your mouth. There is a lot of mind numbing exposition/explanation of physics and brane holes and all the things that make you think that Mr. Simmons is just trying to prove he ran these things past physics/chaos/quantum theory prof friends of his. (My favorite quip from anyone like this was simply "Quantum Physicists have P-branes".)   The book starts out really well. The chapters are of good length. Then they get smaller, more frenetic and things spin in and out and back again until you KNOW the end is going to slam into you and you are not going to like it. It's the same thing I have found over the years with Anne Rice. She would start out with an amazing plot and lose it in the middle and muddle her way to the disappointing, often hard to understand end.  And MAN, if Odysseus were really alive today, there is NO way he'd have followed Sycorax through time just to get it on with her. He'd have tricked her to be with his beloved. Come ON! There had to have been SOME kind of heroic ending instead of him just turning into a horny old time traveler! Gads. Such a letdown!  And BY the way, what EVER happened to the STRONG WOMAN characters that he seemed to have in his previous novels? In this one, she leads her wounded and left for dead group of friends out of serious danger then has a baby and BAM, she is relegated to a minor character who defers to hubby by the end. (Must be all the BOOK LEARNING he could hold over her head. Maybe he didn't send her as many PACKETS????) She just turns from heroine to glowing barefoot momma with kids in the background...ick.  Mr. Simmons is an amazing writer. I would really like to see more of the Hyperion series with a fresh, new slant. I have said this before and I hope I don't see these things anymore. I do not ever want to see another literary translation of a major epic in any more of his sci fi books. The man is seriously intimidating in his love and knowledge of ancient literature but, I can't take another novel full of clips from Keats, Yeats, Proust, Shakespeare and the myriads of Iliads. Moreover, I don't want any more stories with brane holes, creches or resurrection couches. And for goodness sake, stop with the mini-chapters and zillions of characters and sub plots. Too many to keep up with.  All in all, I am seriously disappointed. I even popped for the signed leather limited edition. Oh well. I hope for many more. They can't all be divine. But no more stinkers please!!! I like you too much to see you steep yourself in more of this! 
 I saw this book in the store and the title got my attention, as I am always looking for more material on women in the Bible. However, as I sat down to read through it, I realized that the author -- and we don't know if it's a male or female -- writes with a punishing view. In the story of Jepthah's Daughter, for instance, the daughter is portrayed as quietly accepting her fate, and she is upheld for that decision. In the story of the Concubine in Judges, the re-telling is written in such a way as to suggest that if she had listened to her mother and not complained about her husband, she would not have been raped, murdered and dis-membered. This is a dangerous book for anyone with a serious bent to study the Bible; it is especially dangerous to our daughters.  PLEASE! Do not buy this book 
 Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined "Cyborg" and was murky in "Omega Doom." This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck 
 I'm very disappointed in this book. For the price, I would have expected a little more accuracy, a little less typos, and perhaps a matching key overlaying the computers for the listed ports? Come on - who would have made the mistake and called Bill Gates' magazine influence in January 1975 "Practical Electronics"? For the price, I would accept this? The Apple II model - purporting to be a USA model in the text - have the 230 volt plug insert. I'm sorry, but this kind of error - and the full page pic of the TRS 80 Mod II next to the Model I text, and not referenced in the next page when the II is discussed - and where is the Coco? The TRS80 Mod 100? Why not note that the Acorn was a direct ripoff of the Apple II? People, if you are in the states, forget it. Leave this one to the market that actually could buy most of the computers listed - not that it wouldn't have been exciting to be part of the European tech scene in the late 70s/early 80s. But is Mattel's Intellivision really worth noting as a computer?  Ouch. 
 It was mostly the re-telling of the biker news that you probably already know.  
 I read Mr. Harris' book while on the way back from China, after studying  in Beijing as an exchange student. Reflecting upon my experiences in China,  I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he  says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more  about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for  himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret  my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me 
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 Don't be fooled by the advertisments that you see in almost every magazine.  Blitz doens't offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible.  The greatest inconvience of the game is the load times.  They are WAY too long. Loading up your profile is an inconvience, loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save, you start to think "F*ck this".  The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play.   Then there is the gameplay itself.  Bone crushing hits?  Please, outside of the occasional dirty hit (which is far easier for the computer to employ on you, than vice versa) the hits look like the early developments of Madden.  The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4th quater when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ.  Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable.  Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays.....conventionally treat him and he misses a quater.  Either way, you'll never miss him.  This game is horrible, from the graphics to the load times.  Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest 
 Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...  Don't waste your money   
 Toy Sooner finds new purpose in life when she becomes involved in Sea Turtle rescue operations. The single mother even begins to find romance with Ethan, a director at the aquarium where she works. Just as her life is on the upswing, a new wrinkle is added as her little girl's father strolls back into the picture, apparently wanting a family for the first time. Toy is torn between choosing a man she does not love, but is tied to her child, or the man she trusts and loves. She has some lessons to learn from the dramas going on all around her, especially among the turtles.   ** Perhaps if I was a bigger fan of turtles, this would not have seemed to be such a slowly paced story. The human drama kicks into relatively high gear quite far into the story, but even at the apex, still has the pace of a turtle.  **   Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer 
 Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support 
 My son received this car for Christmas.  It worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the OFF position when we were done the batteries would die.  Each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries!  The last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it won't work.  So now it's garbage! 
 I was somewhat entertained watching this movie, John Travolta made it more interesting that it would have without him. However, it did not really impress me very much. It's the kind of movie to see only once, it's definetely not a collector's item. 
 I hesitate to write a less than laudatory review, given all the praise this book has received over the years (not to mention awards).  And I must include that this was my first Norman Mailer and maybe third true crime read, so I am familiar with neither.  That being said, if you are also unfamiliar and/or not a fan of Mailer or true crime, pick another title.  Please.  Life is WAY too short for people like you and me to experiment w/ this huge, honker of a story, awards or no.  I definitely enjoyed many parts and was interested in some of the characters (e.g. Gary, Nicole, some of their family), but man, too many parts (those detailing the details of every detail lived by indirect parties like lawyers, journalists and producers involved in the trial) read like, "blah blah blah" after a few paragraphs.  I recognize the genius of the work.  I recognize the appeal to a specific crowd.  I also recognize that if it weren't for some stupid compulsion I have to finish any book I start, I would have jumped on the internet around page 350 to skip the journey and get to end. 
 I love many of this author's books, especially Fairy Godmother, and the concept of Tradition. However, in this book she seems to use the Tradition as a crutch. The story is entirely predictable and formulaic, which most readers would find annoying, at the very least, in any other novel, but it seems that because she acknowledges that weakness, it's okay. The book is well written, but essentially boring. I felt very disappointed by this novel. If you really want to know what it's about, read the inside cover. That's pretty much all you need to know about this book 
 She writes well but I find most of the commentary, ironically...rather infantile 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 This book has glimpses of greatness, but such glimpses are too few.  Much of the book makes reference to situations that are too hard for the reader to grasp or are not very well described.  Taken as a whole, the book has  some great characters and some interesting dialog and points.  However, it  drags too much and some of the storylines lose the reader's interest 
 My favorite from this one had to be the fat guy's comment -- "I'd be a rich man if I had a dime for every hour i've spent auditing Pentagon departments" -- what - he doesn't make more than $0.10 per hour?  In 1987?  Give me a break.  Yes, these are great page turners.  But the dialog is absolutely horrendous.    Shakespeare, he is not.   
 This was a ill-concieved item and the publishing company was looking for a quick buck.  This book debuts a month after Enterprise debuts on television.  What were they thinking?  Just from the table of contents, it isn't worth the cost or the effort to produce this.  Where's the Breen, The Gorn, The Tholians.  Bajoran ships are missing, Ferengi ships are missing.  Both Enterprise B and Enterprise C are missing, what a glaring error on the part of the writers and the publisher.  Even among those that are mentioned, this book just barely touches on what can be found in the Star Trek Encyclopedia.  This book has nothing to offer the fans or the occasional watcher.  It toutes itself as a reference for "Academy Students" of the class of 2383. It's a good thing this is science fiction, because it would leave them with nothing useful to have embarking on their careers.  This really shouldn't have a rating of any stars, but...  Don't go near this book unless you like wasting money 
 The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them.   The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite 
 Ok, I'm sure Cal Pozo is a good guy and a great instructor but the cover is WAY TOO MISLEADING!!!  Don't be fooled thinking that there is anyone under 50 associated with this DVD in any way, shape or form.  There are a couple of steps that you might find useful but for the most part the rest is useless unless you plan on taking a senior cruise anytime soon.  If you're looking for a Lawrence Welk experience (Not meant as a shot) then by all means pick it up you won't be disappointed... but for anything else... stay away 
 This book started out well, although the disfigured model theme has been done already, and done much better by other authors.  The thing that killed this book for me was the overuse of the word "egregious" which became such a nuisance to me that I couldn't finish the book.  The author uses the word in places where it shouldn't be used, as if she doesn't know the meaning of it but liked the sound.  Teenagers who wouldn't have this kind of vocabulary use this word constantly in this book.  I'm also displeased by her depiction of both women and men as sexual objects and nothing else.  All in all, disappointing 
 As far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go, the silicone-encased wires are very flexible--a far cry from the hard, thick plastic whisks with only a few wires.  They are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem.  The silicone is soft and not durable.  After a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer, the silicone gets easily cut.  The silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose.  I have been very careful, but this works out to probably $... each time I used it 
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 Not much information to find in this book, though it can be entertaining if you are bitter and need to find something to read while you are in the same situation.  Don't look for answers from this self helper, there are none.  Spend your money on ice cream instead.  You'll be happy you did 
 Nobody ever wants to talk about the Serbs' point of view. If you watch a movie by a Hungarian film-maker name "Children of Kosovo: 2000" you get a real sense of what happened in Kosovo. This movie gives the view of both Albanian and Serbian children that live in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica 
 I nearly cried when I realized that this was an abridged version. There is no indication in the record. I was really looking forward to these CDs 
 I only wish it were possible to give them no stars, or just red x's. These guys never shipped my order, and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then Amazon. Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's 
 Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 Does D.S. know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended. I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.  Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.  I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire 
 Well I just woke up from a long nap after trying yet again to *yawn* read a chapter of this *yawn* book.  Definitely not nearly enough bananas or geese in it for me.  If you want to hear long drawn-out stories about getting files from government agencies....well all I'm saying is  I guess my primary interest in Lennon has always been his music and I just don't give a hoot about this stuff-- not enough entertainment value.  I thought the book "The day Elvis Met Nixon" was much better.  Oh go ahead write me a negative response 
 I purchased a Creative Zen Vision this weekend from a local retailer.  I plugged it in and the light came on indicating that it was charging.  I turned it on briefly while it was charging (a few hours in) and turned it back off.  I was never able to get it to turn back on again.  So I returned it and got another one.  The second one was even more broken.  When plugged in, the light didn't even come on.  I left it there for a few hours hoping it might have been charging anyway, but was never able to make it come on.  I returned it for a refund 
 I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one.  I just liked it.  It was okay.  Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors.  I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them.  However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.  I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story.  Very disappointed. 
 I'll admit, its probably just me.  Maybe its just that I dont understand British culture all that much, nor the culture of football or the mind of the obsessive sports fan...but aside from a few amusing passages (between LONG spells of really dull ones) I really wasnt all that impressed with this book.  It had a few moments that made me chuckle, but it certainly wasnt as drop-dead funny to me as all the reviews led me to believe.  It was long, drawn-out, and filled with names and places of people I've neither heard of nor cared about.  But again, its just a clash of culture; this would be like someone from England reading a book about the Dawg Pound in Cleveland or the fans with terrible towels in Pittsburgh.  Basically, if you're not a sports fan or if you dont know anything about soccer or its culture, I'd pass on this one.  While it did give some interesting insight into the mind of the obsessive sports fan and a glimpse of a true English soccer fan I just wasnt entertained.  Then again, I'm probably not the type of person to whom this book was intended...I really should have read High Fidelity!   
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but I found this book to be a rehash of stuff I've read over and over in other places. There's too many numbers in here. What people need is an attitude about money, not just "save  so much money for so long at 10% interest per year and you'll have so much  saved for retirement at 65, but if you wait until you're 35 to start,  you'll only have this much saved...." (that's not a quote from the  book, but you can place that quote in almost any financial book, and it  will fit just fine). Personally, I thought the Millionaire Next Door was  better and Rich Dad Poor Dad in a leauge of its own. Any book on this  subject will certainly convey "some" information. The problem is  that they are too number oriented. People need to focus on paying  themselves first regularly, having a set savings program and intelligent  investments. This book seems to be more focused on getting rich by  retirement. That's just great, but anybody who saves money over 40+ years  darn well better be rich by retirement or they don't know what they are  doing. On the other hand, I think the authors are realistic in the sense  that this is not get rich quick by any means. If you want to sum it all up,  no matter who you are or what your circumstances are, save money on a  regular and consistent basis, cut up ALL of your credit cards, pay cash for  everything, keep your wants and spending under control and that's about it  really. It's not that hard to get rich. I just wish the book had more  practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers  and statistics 
 The first 9 tracks here (with the possible exception of "Don't Lie To Me" which actually does sound like the Stones circa 1964)are terrible. It's obvious they were never intended for release and most were just demos recorded for other people. I like "Heart Of Stone" and "Out Of Time" but the versions here suck.  The meat of this record is 10-16. "If You Let Me" is a Between The Buttons outtake. You can see why it was overlooked in the end, but not a bad song (and one worthy of this type of collection).  "Downtown Suzie" and "Family" are both Beggars Banquet outtakes. Though "Suzie" is a Bill Wyman composition, its waaaaaaay better than his previous contribution "In Another Land" (from Statanic Majesties Request). Beggars Banquet is basically flawless from start to finish--- but "Downtown Suzie" and "Family" would be ideal bonus tracks on that album.  "I Don't Know Why" is great (from the Let It Bleed era).  The other tracks here (strange fast version of "Memo From Turner", "Jiving Sister Fannie" and "I'm Going Down") stem from the "Let It Bleed" and post-"Let It Bleed"-going-into-"Sticky Fingers" period. Interesting but unessential.  To me, this album boils down to "I Don't Know Why", "Downtown Suzie" and "Family" with a few (and I mean few) interesting bits around it. But considering the first 9 tracks (excluding the one mentioned earlier) are terrible, this is a real risky purchase.   The saddest thing about this album is that there REALLY ARE some great unreleased Stones tracks, particularly from this era (bootlegs galore to prove it). It's a shame that the record company put out this instead (makes sense it's out now as it's part of the "official" discography.....the album originally came out in '75 to milk as much money as the could from the Stones). Hopefully one day, someone will compile a box set of the good stuff that has never been officially released and leave crap like most of this where it belongs--- in the vaults collecting dust.  
 This book is full of information, but none of it hit home for us.  We came away with only one idea that we are actually going to use and found many of the sayings and toasts to be very cheesy 
 this book is a load of crap. hope that helped 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 First time I looked through this book, was curiosity of my local library.  Checked out, and was blown away with how cool this book is.  That was 9 months ago.    Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book.  After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are.  Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here.  Was there any quality control as this book went to press?  And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum.  Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.  Just, well,  disappointing.  If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.  While I must say, for $14 or so, you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be... 
 I have never heard such garbage in years... This fellow should go back to working at Starbucks for a job; leave music alone 
 Colbert loves the Lord, and that is plain.  His spiritual advice can be characterized by Philippians 4:13, and that is good advice.  However, his medical advice, in this book, is suspect.  The main point of the book, medically, is to understand insulin.  Although Colbert does describe this through several pages, the pages are very short and small, and we are not left with sufficient information to understand how his theory works, and on the surface, at least, it appears contradictory.  This review can not be long enough to explain my point, but let me point out some fairly obvious problems in other things he says.  On page 28 he says men should eat 4 ounces of meat at each meal.  His sample diets don't show this.  Further, in his other book, What Would Jesus Eat, on page 200 he says, "I do not recommend over 4 ounces of meat a day".  On page 29 of this book he says that men are to eat 4 ounces of "protein" at each meal.  He uses this term very loosely.  A slice of bread has protein, but probably not 4 ounces.  A piece of chocolate has protein, but probably not 4 ounces (unless it is a very large piece of chocolate).  By examining his sample diet we might guess that he really meant "4 ounces of certain high protein foods".  The samples show things such as fish, meat, poultry, cottage cheese, etc.  Some days you would eat meat at least twice, which he has warned against in other books.  In this book he recommends the use of various oils.  In What Would Jesus Eat he recommends only olive oil, and virgin or extra-virgin olive oil at that.  What's more, in What Would Jesus Eat he points out that the failure rate for diets is about 100%.  In that book he argues that only a changed lifestyle can sustain weight loss.  Which is the truth?  Since What Would Jesus Eat is a later book perhaps that reflects his latest thinking.  It is also a much better, more enjoyable book.  I recommend that book over this if you want to stick with Colbert, but better yet, look around for other authors and get a second opinion 
 This book is a feeble attempt to slam a politician. There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning. 
 Unfortunately, I picked this book up by accident in the library.  I can accept that Smith is a product of her time, but the content of this book is based on romantic myths about black culture.  Of course Nonnie is happy she  is having this white man's child, in the white male hierearchal system that  we live in it is romanticized that all black women, and black people in  general, want to claim what is white.  This story is about Nonnie and how  horribly mixed up she is. Why on earth would she return to Maxwell to chase  after someone else's child when she has a college degree?  She does have  other options. I am sorry, but this book is sub-par at best 
 I never thought I would end up liking the albums with Brian better than the ones with Bon Scott, but that's how it turned out when I listened to all of them. Really the only AC/DC album that I completely love is "Back In Black", it's obvious why it's famous. I was surprised to find that I hated every song on this album, the melodies have no direction but have the same repetitious guitar patterns and simplicity of all the albums before it. Thank goodness Brian took over, though I'm certainly not saying it's good that Bon Scott died. None of the albums with him on it are any good, although I can't say that about "High Voltage" because I have yet to hear that one. This CD, however, is simply awful. Really boring, I nearly fell asleep listening to it. AC/DC's a bit more popular than they really need to be, though I can see why everyone would wear "Back In Black" shirts. NOt recommended 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 Christopher Walken (Suicide Kings, King Of New York) wants Asia Argento (Scarlet Diva, Land Of The Dead) to seduced  brilliant geneticist so that he can switch firms. Willem Dafoe (The Clearing, Shadow of the Vampire) is Walken's partner and is in deep love with Argento and as we go threw the story it gets really boring and eventually in the process of seducing the guy, Argento goes missing, she vanishes, but where does she go? Dafoe ends up flashing back, remembering, thinking, maybe, was it him that Walken and Argento were messing with or whatever...the flashback segment goes on and on and we are rendered bored watching this poor sap try to puzzle the pieces together and when it comes to the end you dont care about any of the characters. The part where I laughed the most was when Walken was through off to his death...I think he yelled "Wow!" really loud and all I saw was him fall and go splat...even when he gets killed, Walken is still the funny man. Also starring Annabella Sciorra (Jungle Fever, Underworld (1997) and Gretchen Mol (The Thirteenth Floor, Forever Mine), both are barely in this movie and are wasted. Probably one of Abel Ferrara's worst. This was released in 1999 but shot in 1997 
 I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following. NWA - Straight Outta Compton Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted Dr Dre - The Chronic Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle Nas - Illmatic Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food Tupac - Me Against The World Tupac - All Eyez On me Tupac - Greatest Hits 50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar Biggie - Life After Death You get the picture 
 To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state.  His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible.  He bases most of it off the perverted  works of "Progressive" historians, among them Charles A. Beard,  whose "Economic Origins" serves as the main basis of his  commentary on the Constitution.  Together with his mistaken history, he  also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory.   Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem  the book somewhat.  I would recommend the work as a source of strong  libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the  difference between the state and government).  However, I would suggest  that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with  those of historians as  BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl  Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis 
   ALONG TIME AGO I SAW THIS IN THE THEATER, AND FOUND IT INTERESTING HOW THE PAINTING OF THE CHAPEL WAS DONE.  HOWEVER, IT WAS VERY SLOW MOVING, FOR A TEEN AGER.  NOW THAT I'VE GROWN OLD, (63), I COULD HARDLY STAY FOCUSED ON IT AT ALL.     IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THIS MOVIE, I WARN YOU IT WILL BE PAINFULLY SLLLOOOOOWWWW. THINK OF IT AS "THE AGONY NOT THE ECSTASY".  SORRY MR. HESTON, BUT ITS TRUE. I STILL THINK YOU'RE THE BEST.      YOUR FRIEND, JEF 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 This movie is very bad, and I mean HORRIBLE. Vin Diesel cannot act! What the heck was he thinking?! Walt Disney must be twisting in his grave!! I will never see this film ever again.  The rest of the cast is disgusting, stupid, and terrible. They get dumber in every part of the movie, and a baby cries through a couple of parts of the film... and it gets very ANNOYING.  If Walt Disney were alive, he'd yell at Vin Diesel, and all the actors in this movie. And the final thing, this is not "comedy" AT ALL.   
 Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing around in a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seen were not believable 
 I was bored stiff reading this novel.  I think J. Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language.  This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow.  I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry.  
 If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat. Seemed to fill the room with it's funk.  Does not grip well. I bought it for grip.  Yes, it's stable. Worth it? Not to me.  Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat(5mm model). It's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat. Not as stable in place, but seems a better value(reasonable price). And it's biodegradable 
 I started to give a review in "deconstructionist" fashion - blather on about architecture surpassing old notions of "in" and "our", of reason giving way to the Neitzhien Uberwill, of absurd interpretations of text, relative yet "ultimate" truth and the unholy trinity of angst, subconscienceness and desire.   I was afraid, though, that it would be taken seriously by students (quote unquote) of post-modern "thought".  The danger of deconstructionism is undeniable. When literature and music are culturally interpreted, ethics are situational, when one speaks of slavery as freedom or humanity as inhumanity, we are lost in a sea of intellectual flotsam.  The personal connections to fascism - Heidegger, Paul de Man, Blanchot, Bataille - can be overlooked. The intellectual similarities can't: The supremacy of  will (Nietzsche) over reason and logic ("homogenising"), an obsession with emotion and political discourse, the celebration of the group over the individual (identity politics) and the idea that truth is what the critic, dictator or prophet says it is. Deconstructionism is, needless to say, popular among folks favoring modern "intellectual" movements with fuzzy tenets.   Here, he speaks to us eliptically (of course) as he partakes in the familiar one step forward - two steps backward approach. But if one follows Deconstructionism, why can't HIS writings be interpreted as an S&M fantasy or a desire to be a Greek Orthodox priest in drag?  How do we know what he really means since he suggests that we often write exactly opposite of what we mean?.  He writes of God, death, solitude, life and sacrifice BUT in a new voice of existentialism and doubt.  He employs vague, self-defined and self-referential terms which  effectively shield him from serious study.   Derrida, for all his rampant explicating, gets hot under the collar when his own words undergo the deconstruction challenge.  Few have questioned his writings since (1) many are impossible to understand and (2) they may or may not mean what they say. What began as a new approach to literature has evolved into the language of intellectual totalitarianism. No one denies his extensive knowledge of Western literature; what galls are the bewieldering interpretations and his ironic attempt at building a new ethos based on syllogism.  As another reviewer stated, take it slow, read several times, search for meaning even when there is none 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 This is a total looser.  When I first saw the title I wondered why I was not acquainted with the movie.  After I saw the movie I knew why.  It must have had a limited engagement and no self respecting medium would use this movie for entertainment 
 Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it 
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 I really began to by liking this book about a Gina whose grandfather is dying and although he forced Gina's mother to put her up for adoption when she was born, has decided to make amends.   She arrives to find her grandfathers stepson Ross is gorgeous and running the family business. Fine by her as she asserts repeatedly that she doesn't want anything from the man. She is just there to meet her grandfather then head back home.  With in the first few chapters the grandfather dies and when the will is read low and behold Ross and Gina must wed. Suddenly Gina is interested in keeping her shares rather then selling enough to let Ross have a controlling vote in the business.  Flip Flop: all of a sudden, she is getting married, and spends lots of money, has little to do with her adopted family, and is so suspicious of her future husband its amazing she hasn't completely turned green.  The cast of characters surrounding Gina and Ross are far more interesting then Gina herself and how Ross fell in love with her is beyond me. She flips flops on everything from the money, to a trip to England, to weather or not they have sex.  I would say read another Kay Thorpe this one isn't one of her best. 
 At a lecture at West Point United States Military Academy April 6, 2006, Naom Chomsky argued, "Just war theory" literature "deserves special attention but is ultimately not very instructive about just war".  "Just war theory" is "declarations of personal preference", which "never tells you anything. It doesn't tell you when it is proper to intervene, what it tells you is 'I think it is proper to intervene'...there is a big gap between assertion and argument, between surmise and evidence."  "We learn very little about just war from 'Just war theory'" what we do learn is "mostly about the prevailing moral and intellectual climate in which we live." Walzer's book relies crucially on such premises as "Seems to me entirely justified, or I believe, or no doubt." Chomsky then discusses scientific studies on human behavior which is noticeably absent from Walzer's book.    Walzer uses the term "I think" at least 52 times in the book. "I don't think" 7 times. "I believe" twice, "no doubt" at least 41 times, and "seems to me" 12 times (I write "at least" because the same phrase twice on one page would be counted once.)   Walzer's hypocricy  In a book which suffers from terribly bad organization, on page 62 Walzer finally systematically lays out his arguments, stating that "Once the agressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished."  On December 29, 2005, in an interview on NPR Morning Edition ('Just and Unjust Wars' Author Critical on Iraq.) Walzer stated that the Iraq war was not a just war:  "If you are going to use military force in someone else's county...There has to be a cause of some urgency, a massacre in progress.  A massacre in memory is not a just cause."    Therefore, if you follow Walzer's assertions to its obvious conclusion, the Iraq war was not a just war and therefore "the agressor state", the US, should "be punished."  But Walzer signed and endorsed The Euston Manifesto, which states in part:  "We are also united in the view that, since the day on which this occurred, the proper concern of genuine liberals and members of the Left should have been the battle to put in place in Iraq a democratic political order and to rebuild the country's infrastructure...rather than picking through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Therefore in Just and unjust wars, Walzer argues that "agressor states" should be "punished" but yet Walzer signs a document which criticize those who "pick through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Although the Iraq War is not covered in this book, Walzer's inconsistent views on the Iraq war should give serious students of International affairs pause before subscribing to his arguments. It is one mans opinion, full of statments such as "Seems to me entirely justified" "I believe" or "no doubt."   Walzer's arguments are unscientific rablings of one intellectual which are "ultimately not very instructive about just war".      
 This dvd version must have been a direct transfer from a video, or a bootleg by someone sitting in the theatre because the quality is absolutely horrible!  The distributor should just throw these babies away because they are not worth even a penny.  If I had to choose, I would just go out and buy the video version.  This dvd records all the pops, clicks and faded images, and is it my imagination, or is the film constantly shaking?  If you like Strictly Ballroom (and it is a wonderful film), buy the other dvd version - or stick to the video 
 If you suspect you or your child has ADHD ("A.D.D." is not the correct acronym), please look elsewhere for treatment and practical strategies.  Any ADHD intervention book worth its salt includes a variety of approaches to treatment.  If you want to avoid medication, there are plenty of options - this book is nothing novel.  However, medication does work best for many children and adults and the benefits definitely outweigh the "costs" (which are relatively minor - these medications are considered quite safe).  Stimulant medications do not "change" children's personalities or "break" their spirits - they help them improve their ability to function academically, emotionally, and socially.  Why wouldn't you want these things for your child?  Please talk to a physician or psychologist and ask for book recommendations.  This book is a waste of time! 
 i purchased this book, mainly because of my love for michael moore's work and i wanted to see what the other side had to say. however, most of the book simply pointed out flaws in michael moore's character, rather than attack the things he had to say. im sure most of us could assume that michael moore was not the easiest person to get along with. i was upset when reading this book, as i am with most political books, because rather than put up well spoken arguments, the author just bashes anyone who believes otherwise. i am a liberal and was disgusted when reading certain parts of this book, mostly because it consisted of essays trying to debase liberals and not much else. the things they pointed out about michael moore's movies/books that were false were good points, however they were trivial when compared to the larger things that moore had to say. overall, i was not impressed with what this book had to say, i was insulted, and it looks like i wasted a fair amount of money 
 I bought this TV Oct 18th as a refurb from 2nd Act. 2 mos later, haven't watched it yet. It arrived broken (turns on & off continually). 2nd Act totally uninterested. Only Sharp warranty repair in/near Austin is ET Television, which got lowest possible rating on Austin City Search. I couldn't agree more. In shop for 1 month, got it home & still broken. Sharp customer Service has been a nightmare. No response, people on phone keep saying they are sorry, nothing they can do. 
 I guess the other people who reviewed this book paid far more attention in English class than I did.  I find this book's instructions difficult and time consuming.  It seems like you have to do an awful lot of work on the different sounds, syllables and stresses in your last name before you can begin to look for a first name.  Then comes trying to find a middle name that fits into the phonetics and poetry rules the book tells you to follow.  WAY TO DIFFICULT!  Just give me an old fashioned baby name book any day 
 I looked at Intermezzo in a bookstore, and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine.  Beware, beware, beware!  I received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way.  R. Tully is great about responding to emails.  It's a shame the magazine doesn't show up as promptly, if at all.  I recommend Cooking Light.  It is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service.  They replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy 
 I never want to have to look at this garbage again.. 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 This is the first book I read by Shannon Drake. I thought the book was terrible. The hero wore a leather mask and is "rude" through out the book. He comes across as a mean and uncaring. Also the plot was overcomplicated(there are mulitple characters that don't add to the story). I could not get into the the story and ended up reading half of it and skimming the rest. 
 If you enjoyed having the conservative Catholics as the bad guys in The Accidental Pope, the Day of Confession, and Angels and Demons, then this book is for you.  However, if you think that such portrayals completely distort the conservative (that is, the Catholic) point of view, then don't buy this crap.  As with all such books, he never gives the traditionalists' points of view or arguments.  Rather, they are all simplified into power questions and are made heartless--you know, heartless conservatives, like John Paul II.  Sad.  Don't waste your money.  
 This book is terrible.  I lived in Japan for more than a decade and I was planning a short excursion so I bought this book.  It was not helpful at all.  It covers the greatest hits of  Japan but has very little detail about most places. It seems to assume that you'd want to just ride the train all the time without ever getting off.  Most of the suggested trips are incredibly unrealistic about the amount of time it would take to visit the listed places, almost to the point of ridiculousness.  I do not recommend this book at all!  Any other guide book and a rail map would be much better.  If you are planning on traveling in Japan, skip "Japan by Rail" and get "Gateway to Japan" published by Kodansha.  It is the best 
 "Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
 In some areas of this book there is misinformation on some of the types of alternative therapies.  This book is very slanted against any kind of alternative therapy.  By the standards raised in this book even modern medicine is against the Bible. 
 The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are "what's for dinner tonight," and "what will the plumber work on next."  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like "modicum" and "greasy spoon" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back 
 This isn't one story, but seven. One for every one of the papa mouse's sons as they lay in bed. They are but a few pages, and most all of them aren't very good. This book is best for those ages 2 or 3, through 8 or so 
 This book is so full of waffle and technical innacuracies, dangerous ones at that, see the chapter on wiring a battery. You either agree with his attitude or yours doesn't count. You must do this, you must do that. My way is best, no other way counts runs all through this book. He is uncompromising and dictatorial and I'd hate to crew for him. I also wonder  if his family life is as described in the book as it sounds so soap opera stereo typical, incidents pulled right from a tv show. It is not much help if you don't have money as he writes from a position of starting off with  a healthy amount. All in all there are many more interesting and accurate and helpful books on this subjec 
 The book was repetitive and boring.  One theme, that could have been stated in a paragraph, was repeated over and over again to create a book. I found it to be primarily about what wonderful things the author has done for people, with letters praising her over and over. Yuk.  I read this as a selection for our church's book club, and skimmed the last quarter of it because it simply had nothing to say that it had not been said before.  I appreciate the sentiment, just felt that the author spent more time praising herself than anything else. 
 I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions. I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail. Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion. Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species. I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.  No, I don't "dig" it, Dean 
 This book says too little about so much. Save your money and buy a real book not a promo type book for other books 
 Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 We recently planned a trip to NYC with our 6 and 1 year old.  I picked up this book, seeing as we have never been to NYC.  The hotel we chose out of this book was in a neighborhood I would not consider safe for children.  We ended up changing hotels because of it.  The book said there was a children's playroom in our new hotel...there was not.  We went to the Children's Museum of Manhattan, which the book says is good for kids 8 and under...our 6 year old was bored!!  Also, the museum does not allow strollers, which I think is important info that should have been mentioned, but was not.  There were other little bits of info that the book mentioned that were incorrect.  Needless to say, the book was packed away by the middle of the trip...it just wasn't reliable 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I love piano ensembles, and Jason is very talented, but I sure don't enjoy anything on this recording.  I kept it in the CD player for five days straight, and for me anyway, there is too much pointless noodling around.  I have no problem with the "new take on the blues", but what take?  Some sparse twanging, some nervous bass lines that I simply am not moved by and can't connect with at all, and some pounding.  Perhaps this is just not my kind of music.  But in fairness to myself, I can handle adventure, dissonance, noise, looseness; this just doesn't amount to much.  I sure love the playing on Black Stars and the live Badwagon recording (except I still get too distracted by the nervous bass that seems like somebody playing in a diferent band in the next room), but this CD leaves me flat.  I'll watch Jason because he is certainly "the real deal", no doubt about that, but I'd pass on this one. 
 My senior year i had to pick this book for an economics project... bad choice. I do like how there are boxes placed every so often with little stories/parables/facts etc. thats pretty nice i'll say, but the rest is repetitive bi***in, depressing, whining information that does interest me in the least. i think i'm better off going and reading some harry potter books 
 Although I believe it was an honest effort, some of the information was misleading. A few of the authors views were in error as I know from experiance. (i.e. "a knife shorter than 3 inches is BS." I have seen people attacked and severely injured by screwdrivers and knives shorter than that.) There were some good points, and I'm sure that some people who have never been exposed to this will find the section on the use of a belt particularly interesting. Certainly NOT the holy grail of martial arts books though.  
 Mr. De La Torre claims to teach the Ernest Jones method (which produced numerous national champions on both sides of the Atlantic) but then pollutes the Jones method by taking the hands out of the downswing.  After unsuccesfully trying Manuel's method for a while, I happened upon Arnie Frankel's Golf's One Motion video.  It is a much more straight forward presentation of the Jones method.  Understanding the Golf Swing misses the mark 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there.  This mirror is hard to install, and everytime you hit a bump it falls down, rendering it useless.  It is just very poorly made from cheap materials.  I am very disappointed with the Eddie Bauer line at Target.  Almost every Eddie Bauer product I bought ended up breaking in a week or I just returned due to such poor design.  Target needs to stop selling these items, they are a waste of money 
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though 
  I guess encouraging people who were blown away by this movie to read may not be an entirely bad idea.  The only problem is it merely encapsulates the same cherry-picked notions of Quantum Theory as an attempt to legitimize certain dogmatic doctrine in the New Age movement, specifically Ramtha.  Otherwise, a rather transparent attempt to further profit from a badly wrought movie, through the bank accounts of people eager to gain insights into our beautiful world, perhaps ignorant that they are being taken for a ride 
 Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?)  The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover.  This was a guy I could get to like.  Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars.  If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated.  Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs?  Sure.  Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book.  I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already 
 Morehouse's book begins to unravel as one reads.  The accounts of remote-viewed things were far too generic and received (ark of the covenant, Mars, complete with ancient living beings, angels in flowing robes no less who guide him) to be believable.  Truth has a certain baroque quality, which this story is lacking.  Also, the reader is informed that angels informed Morehouse that they live in "a dimension parallel to yours."  Hunh?  We live in a three dimensional world (if you do not count time as a dimension) in which each dimension is perpendicular to the other two.  So how is some other dimension parallel to all of these three?  And are the angels saying they exist in a single dimension?  They inhabit a straight line?  We are further informed that God lives in a four-dimensional world.  Gee, so do we, if you count time, which most physicists do.  So... what distinction is being made?  The story smacks of the scientifically impoverished imaginings of the author.  
 This is the last and final time I will be reviewing this movie.  The movie begins as Izzy Daniels, a boxer, is dancing in the streets. (Can we some Lionel Richie in the background?) He comes across Mary and her friends double-dutching where he says that it looks pretty easy, and all that jazz.  He watches them at a competition, and realizes it looks like fun, so he joins there team, but Mary is hesitant to let him join. Finally, he joins.  But doesn't tell his father. Ah, yes, the plot thickens.  Overall, an "okay" movie, but not worth buying if you ask me. It's pretty much like every other Disney Channel movie out there. Person is good at one thing, then does something to disappoint someone else, big happy ending.  Personally, the music was just okay. But everybody wants to be a singer. I mean, Keke Palmer needs to STEP AWAY from the microphone.  Corbin does his best at producing an upbeat track, "Push It To The Limit", and ends up making a fairly-decent song, but not great.  Worth watching on Disney Channel when they play it, if you can spare an hour and a half. 
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 How much can I emphasize that I wish we HAD NEVER PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM?  Purchasing a radio from a dollar store would be a better investment.  This unit is the result of poor manufacturing and will provide you with poor performance.  I'd give it no stars if that were an option.  We have had our new Bose system hooked up for about two months.  One major complaint is the lack of a headphone jack.  I have never heard of a stereo system without a headphone jack.  We were updating all of our components and purchased a new Sony DVD Recorder/VHS and a new DirecTV DVR with Tivo.  We were trying to pair down our equipment.  Turns out, none of these components have a headphone jack.  All of these newer components are being produced without headphone jacks, which left us in quite a pickle.  Fortunately, we found a company called "Ramsey Electronics" which provides a headphone amplifier with audio cables to allow us to hook our headphones through the Ramsey unit and then into the Bose unit.  It set us back $80.  Next, we had the dilemma with the remote.  The Tivo remote won't work with Bose, though it did work with my 12 year old Pioneer sound system.  Then, I spent another $100 on a decent learning remote that could control all of my components, but I'd rather use the Tivo remote.  As irritating as that was, the most irritating thing about the Bose unit is that the audio/video plugs do not stay plugged in.  They are all kind of "loose."  We bought new, expensive A/V cables, thinking that would solve the problem.  We've tried everything to remedy this problem, including pushing the unit up against the back wall of our entertainment center in order to keep the plugs from falling out.  I can't tell you how disheartening it is to be in the middle of a movie with a $1300 Bose sound system and just have the sound go OUT because one of the plugs fell out of its socket.  It's not a tension issue, either.  It's poor manufacturing.  Even more flawed is the DVD disc tray.  First, there is NO eject button on the remote, then when you press the eject button on the unit, it will just say "Opening..." Nothing happens!  Then, when you press it again, it just says "Closing..."  Nothing happens.  My husband had to "teach" me that if you push the eject button in rapid succession, you can sometimes get it to open.  That's just swell for a $1300 investment.  I have a DVD player in the guest room that I paid $29.99 for and it opens and closes its disc tray, no problem.  Go figure.  Fortunately, for us, we have the Sony DVD Recorder/Player and use it when the Bose is being "temperamental."  We've only been able to successfully watch 3 DVDs using the Bose because the tray won't open.  Also, it sounds NOTHING like it does in the store.  I don't know if they have some special demo disc or what, but our 12 year old Pioneer system had far superior sound.  We've never owned a Bose unit before and thought we were stepping up to purchase this one.  I think we stepped way down.  Also, how can a company that manufactures headphones-not make any units with a headphone jack?  That makes no sense, at all.  To inform me in the literature that I will "lose sound quality" by plugging my Bose headphones into a "non-Bose" component must be some sort of joke.  The Bose units don't have a headphone jack, what else am I supposed to plug them into?  I am confused about this.  I've always been told that Bose is the leader in sound components, but this headphone issue is just a lack of good common sense and the shotty manufacturing of the plugs and disc tray have caused me an enormous amount of stress and regret.  Save yourself money, time, regret, and stress by finding a different system.  This one will only test your sanity in regards to the $1300 you spent on this piece of junk 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 I had seen this book at the book store for awhile until one day not long after Christmas, I decided to pick it up. The back of the book sounded good and I do like to read books set in New York City. But as you can tell from my one star, I believe I made a mistake in buying it. Plastered across the front and on the side are the words, "Coast-to-coast Bestseller" and "National Bestseller". I definitely don't agree that it's bestseller material. The story is just weird all around. I kept waiting and hoping that it would get better but it didn't. All the characters are strange, even the main character. Liv continues to date Andrew, even when it's shown that he's a liar and has a weird thing about biting her ear. At one point, he even tears her ear and she has to get it stiched back on. But does Liv quit seeing him? No. Because that's behavior that's okay, I don't know. He also steals the curtains in Liv's ex-husband's apartment for Liv and the first time they meet, he picks her up and dangles her over a balcony. He does countless other things that would make me run the other way if I was Liv. Then there's Liv's first real estate employer, Dale. Dale is a lesbian and of course, is attracted to Liv and has a kind of obsession with Liv. When Dale was first introduced, I couldn't figure out if she was male or female because I swear that Liv refers to her as a he.  I didn't really care for Liv. She was just one strange character and I just couldn't seem to root for her. I really struggled to finish this book and actually thought of quitting. I didn't because I kept thinking the story would get better but it was strange until the end. Like my title says, the moment I finished it, I put it into the box I have for a future garage sale. This was my first Jennifer Belle book and it will definitely be the last because I don't want to torture myself to have sit through a book that might just be exactly like the strangeness that is "High Maintenance" 
 The leaves are changing color and the days are getting cooler.  " I smell winter in the air," said bear.  " It is time for me to crawl into my cave and sleep."  " But I must tell snail  first."   	As a forest of friends, realize that the leaves are  changing and that winter is coming, they must tell each other. It starts  with bear, and she tells snail.  Snail tells skunk then skunk must tell  turtle and the list goes on. Finally, ladybug gets the message and she goes  to tell bear.  When she gets there, bear is already sleeping in her cave.  Lady bug wakes up bear and tells her that winter is near and that is time  for her to crawl into her cave and sleep.  Bear says "Ladybug, I am in  my cave and I was sleeping." Ladybug says she is sorry.   Then all the  animals say goodnight to each other. 	This book is not very exciting  compared to most children's books. There is not really a turning point.   All that the tale does is repeat the same thing from animal to animal. The  animals just tell each other that winter is coming and that it is time to  sleep. Author Denise Fleming did a poor job of writing the story.  The  moral of the story, which is to go to sleep when it is bedtime, was weak.   She could have easily put in more detail and action and still get the same  point across. 	Even though the author did a bad job with lack of  excitement she did do a good job of describing the setting and what was  going on.  When snail is moving Fleming used the words " slowly  slithered", when she described how turtle moved, she used the words  " trudged up Woodchucks hill," and she used the words "  scritch and scratch" to describe how skunk was digging.  By using  these words the reader can picture how the animals were moving. Although  the writing was bad the illustrations were good.  The pictures are the only  thing that the book has going for it.  The illustrator did a great job of  showing detail and using bright colors. The leaves were bright and  different colors, just as they would be expected to be in the fall.  Good  detail was also used with the shape of the leaves, trees, animals, and each  animal's house. Some other good things about the book are that the print is  big, there are only a few sentence on each page, and there are not very  many big words.  These are good examples of why this book would be good for  kids who are learning how to read. Because there are not a lot of big  words, so kids would be able to understand what they are reading. 	  Time to Sleep would make a great bedtime story, because it would probably  bore kids to death.  This book would be a great story for kids to read, but  because of its lack of excitement it wouldn't be a very good book to read  to them. 								- Jessica Pac 
 These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain:  Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the LCD screen. I shoot events at nightclubs a lot, so I'm always (a) running around to get shots, causing me to sweat, which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) I always show the subjects their photos after I take them, so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. For further clarification, I'm Asian, so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities.  I run around a lot when I shoot. So the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. I got lucky once, and found it in the general vicinity of where I was, but the second time, I wasn't so lucky. So what did I do? I purchased another one. Not only did I have to purchase the extender, I had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. Another 2 weeks in, and again, same problem. I didn't even bother buying any replacements, as by this time, I upgraded to the 30D.  If you don't plan on doing a lot of running around, then this piece may be okay for you. However, please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my Canon Backpack. For some reason, the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera.  Another problem, as most people mentioned, is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender, so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day.  I guess I'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30D; I'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10D 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  The thing has got nonsense written all over it.  The "future animals" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST!  Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  A vortex? A posset?  What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  Can he please be institutionalized?  I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science 
 I haven't actually read the book, but the title says it all...the author doesn't understand economics!  Wealth is made by the ingenuity of the people who seek to produce better goods and services that would satisfy consumer demand.  Ingenuity is sadly lacking in China, now, or ever. Look at any Chinese invention, and see its real development only when the Europeans got hold of it, from razor blades to paper money.  Not convinced, look at patent production in China. It is eclipsed by most US states or European nations.  Sorry, no sale 
 The book itself is not bad, information is good, somewhat dated in parts, but good.  The problem is, nothing new is in the book.  All of the information can be found at one of several websites like quicken.com, or bankrate.com, etc.  Most of the information is pretty common sense.  If you have to get the book or don't want to look on the internet for the information, then at least go to the library and check it out and save your money 
 My wife and I have driven to Florida many times over the years and were quite interested when we heard about this book.   What a disappointment, it's a waste of money. The print quality is terrible and looks as if it was  printed on a dot matrix printer.   It is full of advertising some of which  is passed off as editorial material.   Although it has discount coupons,  one of the main one expired on 3/31/99.   We also found that many of the  "discount" coupons were just requests for standard tourism  information which is available to anybody from state welcome centers.     Finally, the savings on several of the "real" motel discount  coupons were not as good as those available through **free** motel coupon  books we picked up at rest areas 
 Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste. 
 I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it.  The display, contrast and brightness were great.   However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.    Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons. 
 The transfer is real real bad, the story is also weird but its o 
 Currently the VaR literature is cluttered with books all clamoring for your attention. Thus the potential student of the subject is blessed with being in a position to make a choice. The 'reader from New York' provided a good overview of the relevant literature. IMHO, this book tried to hit a balance between breadth of coverage (different models in practice) and depth (rigour), but the result is a compromise that leaves neither the student of the subject nor the practitioner satisfied. Since other reviewers have done such a good job dissecting this book, I will just concentrate on recommending the books that I feel are better values: For beginning students I feel Kevin Dowd's provides a good overview of the VaR literature in a clear and concise way. For pracitioners and more advanced risk mangement students, I HIGHLY recommend Glyn Holton's new Value-at-Risk Theory and Practice book. His approach is totally refreshing. Instead of starting at the top of the pyramide (the value-at-risk metrics), he starts out at the bottom. He breaks down VaR into its most basic elements. By providing a detailed explanation of difference between exposure and uncertainty, he introduces readers to the mathematical and probabilitistic background material needed to formulate the VaR measure (methodology) and the metrics (resulting VaR value). Both Kevin Dowd and Glyn Holton's presentations are organized and their writing are crisp and easily understandable. You won't go wrong with either book 
 I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 I had the TX-SR304.  Everything sounded great.  However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound.  Sounds almost like a record scratching.  The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme.  The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise 
 I'm an (unemployed) agronomist and I live in Brazil.About this book, I must tell you that I readn't it.In fact, a friend of me, send parts of this bad book to me, by e-mail, from America. She was scare, about the doomed prophecies of this book. There's so many frauds writen in this book, that I can't count the majority of then. 1)This book claims that end of nitrogen from natural gas, will doom modern agriculture and spread famine.In fact, fertilizers with nitrogen can (and are) be produced with hydrogen from eletrolysis of water, using wind, hydro or nuclear energy.At the same time, using genetical engeneering, vegetables such as corn or wheat will produce his own nitrogen.We must see that soybean don't use nitrogen's fertilizers, because bacterias inside his roots made his nitrogen's fertilizers, without artificial fertilizers.This second alternative will produce cheap harvests, without fertlizers with nitrogen. 2)This book claims that climbing oil prices will doom the world.In fact, whith more oil's price, the alternatives of oil will became better than ever.Ethanol in Brazil costs less then US$50,00 each brent.The Athabasca's oil sands are bigger than all Iraq's oil reserves.The shale oil has trillions of brents in the world.If you ad hydrogen to corn plant, you will produce oil.In other words:there's many future alternatives to the oil.  The real big menace, to the world, is the same:religion. Nuclear bombs from Pakisthan, Iran or any other source are real menaces.Mad strong men from North Korea or China are also possible menaces in the future.  
 "Folks tend to believe that this kind of terminology [structure, form or plot] means writing by some type of formula or predetermined format as rigid as a paint-by-numbers portrait. Nothing could be further from the truth."  The problem is that this book is a complete paint-by-numbers kind of book, it teaches you to write common novels, novels that say nothing new. He states that is a lot better for the author, because once you understand the structure, you can be free to be creative in other things... What other things!? After all the rules he tells you to follow, there is little space to be creative...  According to this man, the reader is an idiot. He says that you must begin every scene with a clear statement of goal ("most of the time, the character states his immediate goal in obvious, unmistakable fashion"), and that the character must SAY it, and make it VERY CLEAR for the reader. Can't the reader understand the objective of the character without him saying: "Hey, reader, listen to me, I'm running from the killers because I don't want to be murdered! Got it? OK? Fine, then you know that my objective is not to be murdered!"?   Follow this and you find yourself in problems. I was in problems following it.   Damn, how the hell I am going to leave something to be surprising in the end if every action most have and inmediate reaction?   How can I hide a character's secret agenda if every character must state his goal clearly from the begginning of a scene?  If the protagonist must end in a worse situation with every scene for the book to be interesting, how does he explain the success of "First Blood", where is stated in every page that the protagonist will triumph over the cops?  Or what about the DaVinci Code, where the good guys are ALLWAYS a lot of steps ahead the bad guys?   How can I show scenes between the bad guys if this man tells me we must stick with the protagonist and his inmediate reactions to change all the time?   He NEVER adresses this kind of things.  
 Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.  
 This book has many wonderful reviews. I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. So I read it, then read it again. I didnt find much that is helpful to new writers. Certainly no "Ah,Hah!" moments.  Gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me: "If you were lost in the Amazon jungle would you want an Indian to help you OR someone who knows a lot about Indians?" Gardner knows a lot about writers! This book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature. Very interesting book.  But what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery. New writers are not Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac. New writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly...later they can soar 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 I used this book as a reference for my reactor engineering class. Though it was easily read I was disappointed that the book lacked a lot of computer problems and especially lacked coverage in energy balance 
 For new teachers going into elementary school, this book is filled with good ideas and helpful advice.  However, much of the writing is based on elementary students only.  Most of the ideas would be considered too childish to use with middle or high school students.  Also, many of the advice is clearly for elementary only (rewards for lining up in the hallway, giving students hugs, procedures for borrowing crayons, etc.)  Looking at secondary teaching, I found this book disappointing 
 Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes.  The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche.  Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it.  Not a bad film, just not a good one 
 Things that didn't go anywhere:  The fig The burned notebook the pile of e*crement next to the body the cloak in the tree (how and why did it end up there?) The syphillis the photographer/photography The thumb Otto's story (why was he in the tuberculosis ward if he wasn't originally sick? 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 There isn't anything new here unless you want to fall asleep reading about cheese and whisky.  Dr. Weil gives examples of how some cheese's and whisky get better as they age as if this is supposed to correlate to people.  I love Dr. Weil's other books and his website but I was disappointed by this book.  If you want to read a good anti-aging book read Roy Walford's 120 year Diet.  An excellent read.  
 Listen, I don't have anything against critcizing anything or anyone, including my religion. I do however have a problem when people use lies to do so and Ibn Warraq's sources are extremely skeptical even among Muslim scholars. How he derives his arguments and the texts he does it from are rejected by the majority of Muslims. The text which he seems to miss the most about is the Quran which Muslims regard as infallible (something he doesn't mention again). Overall a waste of my time and more about his own horrible experience with bad Muslims than a bad Isla 
 Although the book had a few cute annocdotes, there were too few (despite repeated references) to stretch it to fill a book (even this short one).  
 What does a well written, well intended Evangelical do with Paul's blatant anti-feminist language? She IGNORES them! You have to ignore it, as with so much of the Bible-Otherwise it doesn't stand up to textual and theological criticism.    For example, 1 Tim.2:11 (and I quote from NKJV) "Let a woman learn in silence with ALL SUBMITION. AND I DO NOT PERMIT A WOMAN TO TEACH (why doesn't this speak to you Mrs. Rutledge?) OR TO HAVE AUTHORITY OVER A MAN, BUT TO BE IN SILENCE.   1 TIM.5:9 "DO NOT LET A WIDOW UNDER 60 YEARS OLD BE TAKEN IN TO THE NUMBER, AND NOT UNLESS SHE HAS BEEN THE WIFE OF ONE MAN, WELL REPORTED OF GOOD WORKS: IF SHE HAS BROUGHT UP CHILDREN, IF SHE HAS LODGED STRANGERS, IF SHE HAS WASHED THE SAINTS FEET (?!)... BUT FOR THE YOUNGER WIDOWS; BUT FOR WHEN THEY HAVE BEGUN TO GROW WANTON AGAINST CHRIST, THEY DESIRE TO MARRY, HAVING CONDEMNATION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAST OFF THEIR FIRST FAITH." He goes to hurl more insults at young women, calling them 'gossips and busybodies.'  Elsewhere, Paul "suffers to have a woman teach," I could go on and on...     This book was a last ditch effort to eek out some value out of Christianity- but instead, she helped me CONFIRM MY UNBELIEF. It's just not persuasive content- Just more Billy Graham boiler plate "Christ died for you" BUSINESS of the church. What a let down.    Once I got half way through, I realized I had nothing new in my hands. The title was catchy for skeptics like myself, but she fails to deliver any novation on the matter of 'Unbelief.' The skeptic knows they don't know it all. That is there creed. This author went on the bandwagon without addressing a true doubters real concerns. She makes herself the proverbial ostrich with her head in the sand. Skip it. Go get "The Book your church doesn't want you to read" instead. Have a great day 
 Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.  Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.  As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.  For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.  I now appreciate the "cliffhanger" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.  Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written 
 If ever there was a rallying cry for abortion this film should be it. Survivor from Freddy's last bloodbath Alice (Lisa Wilcox) is the recipient of his demon seed. Freddy thus gains control over the fetus' dreams and ergo control over Alice. But instead of taking the logical way out Alice insists on keeping the baby ("Grab your crucifix") and in the process provides the fuel the story needs to power through another useless sequel. At one point one character, Mark, even thinks and then recommends that she terminate the pregnancy which she rejects outright. Mark just rolls over, like he was the father to be or something, and says "OK we'll just find another way." What a lark! What follows is a battle for the heart and mind of the not yet born Jacob. Just think of it as a "Rosemary's Baby" for a younger, simpler generation.   The main problem this franchise faced at this point was that they felt every kill had to somehow be more awesome than the last. Early on there is a head-scratcher of a scene where Dan is turned into an actual Ghost Rider. And since they are tied to this idea that every kill has to supersede the previous one you begin to realize that this exercise in extreme silliness is only working against the films. They have become so far removed from reality that you can no longer take them seriously. I would argue that good ol' Freddy jumped the shark a few films back, but as I watched this one I just had this image of his jumping sharks, one after another, in hopes that he could possibly destroy the legacy of even the first film. That said this one is a minor step up from "Nightmare on Elm Street 4." Here they dig into Freddy's very past past and find out that he was the product of a rape that occurred at an insane asylum. Since Freddy has been messing with Alice's baby she enlists the help of his mother in hopes of reigning in the deranged serial killer. The whole thing has a very Jerry Springer-ish smell to it. Since "Nightmare on Elm Street 3" the formula has been about the same and they follow it here as well. Hero has friends who don't believe in Freddy. Said friends have token hobby (here diving and comic books). Freddy kills all of hero's friends using their hobby against them. Hero beats up Freddy. The parents haven't gotten any smarter with time, but here their role is less pivotal. In this one there is a scene where the first thing out of Alice's father's mouth after her boyfriend has died is him blaming her boyfriend for his own death. Classy. The focus has shifted away from the idiocy of the parents and more on creating a nonsensical world for Freddy to frolic in. The only rule in this game is that Freddy is all powerful. My friend, who insisted that I watch the entire series, claims this one to be his favorite. I blame it on the fact that he is a comic book geek and thus represented here. . .although I'm sure he would deny that connection. To me this is the second weakest with the original remaining the only one I can actually recommend. Freddy was running in circles and sucking wind by this point. At least Jason had the good sense to eventually move his freak show into space. **1/2 
 In general, my kid (14 months old) loves the Baby Einstein books. He has a lot of the board books, including the two large ones with bits of different textures (the touch and feel fun books "Violet's House" and "Baby McDonald on the Farm" which he LOVES). So I figured it would be a no-brainer to add this book to his collection.  It arrived yesterday and was put away on a shelf within minutes. While the illustrations are cute as always, the book itself is quite useless for a toddler my son's age. The pages are very thin and almost impossible to turn wihtout tearing them out even by an adult (I thought the spiral bound book would be a great idea and make it easier for him to turn the pages; maybe so in theory, but in practice this book is impossible for him to leaf through). The first page he tried to turn he tore out. The second too... then I took the book away.  As far as content goes, the title is misleading. Yea, there are 365 pictures with captions (in some cases several per page, in others one takes up the whole page) but they are by no means "activities". There is no logic to numbering these pictures as "days" except for the fact that there happen to be 365 captions. So when the book gives the impression that there's something in it for each day of the year, it is misleading.  In summary, neither the content nor the physical properties of the book are up to par. The only activity this book seems to offer is tearing out its fragile and thin pages, and there's not even 365 of those! Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing 
 This book just basically tells you whats coming up in your future as a teen. That you gonna be confronted with drugs, sex, and other things, but it makes you sort of scared to be a teenager. Like it says you shouldn't hold hands because it leads to sex. Taking everything just out of proportion. Makes it sound like your going to burn in hell for doing the littlest things. I wouldn't recommend giving this to your child, or they might fear growing up 
 Weak philosophical analysis.  I expected much more thoughtful discourse.   All I found was "I believe, so there" 
 Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre. 
 The guy singer sucks and Kelli is way too talented for them anyways; she belongs solo. You can't replace a girl singer w/ a guy and keep fans 
 I absolutely loathed this book by one of my favourite authors. We all know that there is an underworld which is inhabited by lawless, immoral low lives, but I for one, don't need to read about it as a source of enjoyment. The book is based around the lives of the family of the eventual killer of Helen Lynley and his terrible childhood. Yes, poverty, misery and crime exist but I don't derive any pleasure from reading and wallowing in it when I could be reading an exciting, uplifting book about decent people, rather than knowing all the details of depraved, amoral garbage who have fewer fine feelings than an amoeba 
 This book was terrible!  DON'T waste your money!!!! There are many other good parenting books out there by people who are MUCH more credible than Ezzo.  Even though some say this book works for them, there are many more who know that it is a slippery slope. Visit www.ezzo.info/ BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK!!!  Parents Beware. 
 Sorry to say I'm not a huge fan of Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month. Few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while. I say if you want neuvo tango try Narcotango or Otro Aires. 
 When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.  It seemed to become less effective each time I used it to the point that now I'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time.  It still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless.  
 also import a cd , money down the drai 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
 I hate this book. You get too about, I'm guessing page 200 and it literally says something along the lines of, "If you didn't understand what we said in the last 200 pages, than that's ok because just about none of it is on the test". What in the hell am I reading this piece of garbage book for?! TO PASS A TEST! I don't want to read about the garbage you feel like craming down my throat, seemingly just for the heck of it; I want to take the test darnit! By the way, I failed the exam I took. Half of the questions in the exam weren't covered in the book. The exam cram questions might as well been hygene or etiquite questions because 90%-95% of them had no resemblance, or were helpful whatsoever to the questions on the actual test.   Also, the book is laced with pathetic attempts at humor throughout the whole thing. I'm sorry but I didn't find any of the "jokes" humorous and all of them were a waste of my time.  For some reason this book seems to think the history of the computer is relevant to the exam when the exam doesn't have 1 SINGLE questions about a computer older than windows 98, and had 0 questions about the actual history of a PC. "The XT motherboard was invented by blah blah, who than invented the XT IMB 2000... 20 pages later.... Than the inventor died and they had a funeral for him". Well, that's great, thanks for the info, what did I just learn? Oh, that's right, absolutly nothing.  Realistically, they could have slimmed this trash-heap of a book into about 200 pages. I would highly reccomend against using this book for anything either than a campfire, or toilet paper 
 I have to admit that this book is well written, but it presents a very definite bias.  It builds a "case" for how modern witchcraft was invented and has no old roots at all, that nothing about witchcraft today has any connection to the witchcraft of the past.    Something that no one can "prove" one way or the other, and Hutton doesn't manage to do any differently here.  A close reading of the sections re Gerald Gardner, etc even has him come close to admitting as much, since everyone who was around at the time that he was using to collect his info from has proved to have not told the truth at one time or another, and there aren't enough "documents" available to scholars to sort fact from fiction.  As if by putting something down in print automatically makes it so.  Still, Hutton bemoans the lack of paper evidence where the beginnings of witchcraft are concerned, not taking into account that there may be good reason for that and one that he perhaps should have more respect for since it is a living religion today, regardless of how it got started.    But then disconnecting the present from the past is a bias of Hutton's in all his books, which are full of great and interesting and useful collections of folklore and mythology and history--so that I end up reading them just for that and skipping over his actual theories and so-called conclusions--as they then go on to state that what we have as folklore survivals today have no real link to the rites and rituals and beliefs of the folks of the past.  This book is no different in that regard, even if it is fixed on witchcraft in specific.            
 I was disappointed in this book. It was confusing in that the author tries to juggle too many lines of analysis at the same time. The lines that I could follow were helpful, but it read like a book whose pages had gotten mixed up and they couldn't remember what order to put them back in. Especially for a beginning player, this book will be confusing. It follows only one variation (Karpov's Be2 line for white) of the Najdorf. I was mislead by the content description to think that most variations would be covered to some extent. It was hard to finish.  
 It was such a dissapointment to get this cd after all the good reviews.  The range of this recording is too broad.  There are moments when there is barely any sound and then MEGA loud.  I have heard other recordings of  Bolero that weren't so extreme.  I'll keep searching 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 There were many times when I had to mentally and physically shake my head as Nye supports his thesis that America's dominance in this globalized system actually necessitates its interdependence with the rest of the world (read; France and Germany).     The underlying idealism of Nye points to a world where if only the United States of America would submit, just a little, to other states and respect (read; follow) their opinions then BY GOLLY our Air will be cleaner and North Korea and Iran will give up their nuke programs.  Also, Europe will magically create a more robust military transport capability and actively participate in counterterrorism and ethno-religious conflicts abroad which, will be on the decline.    My biggest gripe was Nye believing that self constraint will somehow lead to greater leadership opportunities above when these tools of self constraint are tools used by weaker countries to limit US power.  That's why, 'they' want to make US weaker.  Nye, in one sentence by my count, concedes this point but still argues that in the long term it'll be for the good.  However, Nye does not recognize the ulterior motives by countries such as Germany and a nostalgic France (Europe is given way too much credit and attention in his book as well).  Given the self interests of other states and the entrenched problems associated with failing states, failed states, and the Middle East it is a stretch to believe that countries will unite with the United States (who will still be the 100 ton gorilla in the room) and make the world a better place.    I don't buy it.  So...don't buy it.  
 Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.   Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies.   We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it! 
 I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws.  The power button is the only thing on the remote that works.  None of the other controls on the remote work.  Second, it's VERY BASIC.  I would have preferred something that had some "sleep" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control.  The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked.  Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck. 
 We  hastily bought this book for a friend and just as quickly returned it after taking a look at it's content. If you're still on the carnivor boat and wish to expose your child to the high dioxin and chemical load found in meat, then this book's for you. If you're a bit more informed and concerned about the contamination of meat, then look elsewhere for alternative nutrition and recipe info. As a pharmacist, let me tell you that children are exceptionally sensitive to the chemical contamination that is in U.S. produced meat. This ain't the good ol' days and meat has changed. Be very careful where your animal products come from or consider eliminating them altogether 
 The book is well written and thorough description of the territorial claims of Armenia towards its neighbour Azerbaijan. The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, the part of which the former has been from the outset of the history is described on an ill-balanced way. Though, it is useful to get an accord of the opposite opinion for the reader who is familiar with the realities and truth 
 I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
 Can Mr. Luboff, Avalon Travel books, or Amazon spell E-T-H-I-C-S ? My wife and I are determined to move to Mexico. We have been reading several books about the process of making this transition and eagerly awaited Mr. Luboff's book. Having purchased (and enjoyed) his 1999 book, Live Well in Mexico, we figured, the 2002 Adapter Kit, would have more detail, and provide further assistance in our move. THE TWO BOOKS ARE ONE AND THE SAME!! Chapters were simply moved around, and 2 renamed.I don't have a problem with  Mr. Luboff reworking his earlier book, but wouldn't it be ethical to state somewhere (on the cover, in the intro, OR in Amazon's write-up)that fact? I am disappointed. I have to assume Mr. Luboff has nothing further to say and forgot he had already published one book on the subject. 
 I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 The washcloths are "ok" but I was really expecting a thicker more absorbent washcloth that holds a lot of soap while in the shower. Good for the money I guess 
 Reading this book is like watching a porn movie: all sex and no plotline.  Another thing I found unbelievable is that Helen took back her maiden name and became a "Miss" again. From what I know of the period, women loved to be a widow because that status granted them more freedom. Coulter could not come up with a good explanation why Helen would take back her maiden name after her first husband died 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 This album is nothing more than a catalogue of all of the synthpop/futurepop dreck that has been masking itself as goth and industrial music since the late 1990's. Having heard these bands played in clubs I can honestly say that I couldn't tell one from another. Why? Because ALL of them sound exactly the same.They have the same exact beats and same exact angst driven lyrics. I can see why some teens would like them, but if you are above the age of 30,like I am,they will most likely annoy you and make you want to bang your head against a wall.  To those of you who have been calling this music goth please think again. In the 1980's there was a clear distinction between synthpop(Depeche Mode,Book Of Love,etc...) and goth(Christian Death,Sisters Of Mercy). Please don't confuse the two, because they are not the same.  
 It does not give any practical guides on switching power supply design, it's just an overview of topologies. Useles 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 This is an ill-informed fan's one-sided look at the porn industry.  The  author was apparently so in awe of his subjects that he fearfully turned  down the opportunity to be present at the taping of a sex scene between two  porn actors.  In addition,  Mr. O'Toole inexplicably does not include the  details of the porn star Savannah's untimely suicide at the end of her  career.  He refers to her as having "died" after quoting her at  length on her financial success at the height of her career.  This passage  is intended to illustrate that many of the actresses working in adult films  are completely happy doing so. It is inexcusable for him not to mention  that she took her own life after being disfigured in a car accident. Pass  on it 
 I bought this thinking it would be for an introductory coach.... it is more on the rules and very high level.  for example the book reads - "make sure you get the right bat for the batter" and does not explain how to measure right bat height......same is true for the height of the tee...... disappointing.   I'm going to buy another book..... 
 I was very surprised that a lot of peole thought that this book was bad.I thought that the book was gripping but I guess that is just my oppinion. Even though the book had absolutley nothing to do with basketball I still thought it was a pretty good book. But not as good as 5 star 
 Although this book is very detailed on the scientific aspects of marajuana, I found it very texty and hard to grasp for the average grower.  I wouldn't recommend this book for those just wishing to learn more about  growing.  However, if you are into the genetics aspect etc then you will  definitely like it. Personally I was disappointed with my purchase, and  wish I had spent my $$ on info I could actually use.  I rated this book at  three stars, but I notice that my finished copy is only showing one  star...not my doing, I assure you, and can't change it no matter how many  times I try 
 TTHHOOWWNNKK!! That is the sound when an arrow hits you, or at least that is what A.J. heard "Hi my name is A.J. and this is my story about when a cupid was brought into my life. I know you probably think, wow, cool, your own cupid, well it's not all that, and let me tell you. It is tons more and also tons less. It can ruin your life like in my case. I was a nice girl all into journaling and photography and then one second later I had to make a decision on weather or not to choose to make one of my wishes come true. I had the choice of enhancing my love life, becoming a professional photographer, or doing well with my studies. If you knew me, I choose "Love Life." Big mistake turns out only some of the victims of a cupid's arrow get effected. The guy I liked was too strong to give into the power of a cupid's arrow.  	Well, I'll let you talk to Lexie now and you can hear what she thinks.......... I thought the book was ok not the best, but if you're into all of that stuff about cupid then you would love this book, seeing how that is what it is about. I would give this book a chance you may find yourself giving into the power of cupid's arrow.  
 I could not have been more disappointed in a book! This book offers no real spritual inspiration. Maybe Frank Peretti has become enchanted by the Bigfoot legend but this book is far and away his worst. The plot is weak, character development is terrible and the ending is anti-climactic. Extremely disappointing!  Sometimes good authors feel obliged to publish a book, maybe he was pressured, who knows. This is even close to the same caliber of Piercing the Darkness or This Present Darkness 
 As a Witch, I have no desire to read about biblical recipes or lore in a book billed as a Witch's Cookbook. Apart from this, the recipes are mediocre and written in a style best suited for the reader on prozac. 
 Well, I'm less than impressed upon wrapping up a listen to this album.  While it has a few standout tracks among the 11 provided, for the most part they are all mediocre.  I was never a fan of `Vertigo' but I am a fan of U2 so I opted to give the entire CD a listen, and while the remaining singles `City of Blinding Lights' and `Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own' are classic U2 and wonderful listens, songs like `Original of the Species' and `Love and Peace of Else' really bring down the value of the CD.  Some of these tracks serve their purpose.  `Miracle Drug' quickly redeems the album after the dreadful opener `Vertigo' but `Love and Peace of Else' and `All Because of You' quickly knock it back down, and while `A Man and a Woman' struggles to be ballad worthy the following four tracks end the album in complete turmoil.  `Yahweh' has Bono coming off as an out of tune karaoke refugee and ends the album on such a sour note I'm almost forced to swear if off forever, but I won't do that, because they're U2 and on name alone they were saved, this time 
 I have read some past reviews on this book, and i am shocked to find that college students have been using this book for learning. I am currently in high school and my teacher is making us read this book. I find this book very hard to understand. If anyone has any information or quick summaries of this book i would appreciate it. Thanks 
 if you want your children to think that the"cure" for any problem, such as daydreaming, lack of energy or hyperactivity comes in a powder or a pill, then "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic" is right up your alley.  if you believe in slipping mood-altering substances into your child's body is a good thing, here's your book.  if you think children's shortcomings should first be treated with love, avoid this book and the rest of the Piggle-Wiggle books, which treat children like mindless [kids] that parents must trick into good behavior 
 well i do see how people can say we dont believe in chrish ummm our name of our chruch is the church of JESUS CHRIST of latter days saints. and our secret porforms are baptisms and last i check most all christian religions did that. and its a historical fact that the bable has be changes u people need a life and need to stop dogin on other peoples faith just because your insecure of your ow 
 I have read Dilip Hiro's other books, which I am a big fan of, and this one is terrible. It is totally biased against America. It seems that Hiro is questioning Bin Laden's and Al Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 events. He also seems to have a soft spot in his heart for the Taleban regime, and defends them for not turning over Bin Laden to the US.    The historical background he gives on the different nations and religion of the region is excellent and well written. When the book gets into the time of the 20th century and later, it seems that Hiro sides with the radicals, or makes excuses for their actions.  America and the West are not perfect, and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east, but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous. I do not recommend this book, unless you like Al Qaeda and the Taleban 
 TV tuner card was sent and received as stated by the seller.  The TV card however did not work on our laptop (IBM Thinkpad A41p) but worked just fine in a laptop of a different manufacturer.  Had to use AVerMedia website to get resolution of problem but gave up when we realized the process was going to take forever.  Sold it to person who got it to work on their laptop and we just bought a LCD TV 
 My pump just up and quit after several years...and it didn't always work great, but when it did, it was ideal. So I'll replace it, but with some other product, not the Cuisipro again. 
 Keep a good book or a stack of old magazines handy while watching this movie. 
 As an attending/assistant professor of anesthesiology I frequently recommend books for residents to read. I still recommend this book, but with the caveat that much of the information is outdated and some of it is no longer even held to be fact. The underlying theme of the book - that comorbid states influence anesthesia and vice versa - is still true. I tell residents to get a used copy or wait until a new edition comes out 
 I was very disappointed in the book which I received as a Christmas gift. I, too, dislike the light yellow print which is a strain on older eyes! It is difficult to find the recipe on the page because of it.  This might seem trivial to some; but, to others it is a real pain.  Also, the recipes are nothing special.  I am glad that I did not pay for this book 
 I love my Nikon Coolpix 5900 however, the lens failed in less than one year. Service took 6 weeks to repair. The lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair. Why is the lens failing to open again? I absolutely hate the inconvenience of returning this item again for service although I do have a paid plan for it. Why can't warranty be fast, local and competent 
 Very good historical information of mermaids....but did not give the book to my young child because of the nudity featured in the artwork. The artwork is indeed classical, beautiful, and very sensual 
 "Ready for Anything" is a pointless book full of information and ideas that anyone who went through school should already know. I learned a long time ago to write things down instead of keeping them in my head and I also know that being organized gives me more flexibility and less stress so why would I want to read a book in which Allen writes about basic concepts in a philosophical way. Yeah this book might be good for someone who didn't pick up on these basic skills in Middle school but for me it was a waste of my time which I'm sure Allen would agree is not a good use of my skills.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this book because maybe then you will open yourself up to more time for "creativity" which is the point of the book in the first place 
 When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead 
 I was going to assign this book to my students in my Abnormal Psychology class... The first chapter is powerful and true. However, this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children's illnesses!!!! He also attacks NAMI, the National Association of the Mentally Ill, an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover, find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life, and has truly educated more people about mental illness than Breggin has ever done himself, I am sure. The good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are, in my opinion, obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents -- attacks, I believe, that may be a result of his old-fashioned psychoanalytical training 
 I bought this to find out more about her, and it didn't tell me anything new that I'd already read about elsewhere. Don't bother! Instead, I strongly recommend her first solo concert that originally aired on HBO in the early 80's. Unfortunately, it isn't on DVD; it's only on VHS 
 Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUT  flimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs).  Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong.  Ruined my impression of JVC.  Remember the wisdom "you get what you pay for". . .  
 I own all the Nell Hill books and this is by far and away my least favorite. The parties described in the book are not special - and the pictures are less than impressive. There is nothing new in this book - and the information presented is not specific enough. I wish the table settings were described in great detail. There are few fun things - the ideas of having a "sip and see" party to welcome a new infant is fun - but the decorations are not. The Nell Hill family of shops are terrific - but this book is a disappointment. 
 First of all I am a big fan of this band.  However, this CD left me greatly disappointed.  It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired.  Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did.  Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark.  Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best.  I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DUL 
 One of the dumbest movies ever made; insulting plot and bad acting to boot. What a waste of time. One star for trying 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 Oh. My. God. If you've ever wanted to read a book written by someone who is ungrateful and whines and thinks they are better than everyone else, this is YOUR BOOK!!!  This book is so long and drawn out and has NO POINT.  The author had absolutely no reason to write this book, other than to vent their ungratefulness on the rest of us. It breaks down like this: Polish family flees to Canada to escape the Nazis. They start out rough but end up doing quite well. WHERE'S THE STORY!?  The "author" goes on and on and on about how boring things are and describes her self-superiority over everyone else with paragraph after paragraph of just boring descriptions.  It's no fun to read.  She had it VERY WELL growing up in Canada - her family was safe and ended up making a good living there - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!?  The author has an attitude problem - rather than try to make do in her new envrironment, she just whines and whines about it CONSTANTLY. At least her little sister tries to blend in. This one just cries about it and seems to think she can see more or understand more than everyone else around her.  News flash: YA CAN'T.  You are just like everyone else honey.  You should be grateful for all your parents did for you instead of fighting it every step of the way. Don't read this book. It's boring 
 I own have been using "Black Hat" feng shui for the past year and half. Now that we are planning to move to a new place, I decided to look into it more in depth, especially since doing some research I found out that Black Hat feng shui is poo-pooed by many feng shui practitioners as an alter-ised and westernized  form of feng shui that's really too far from the original to work.  Browsing and researching, I came up with a few titles that were highly recommended. I ended up getting this one because it seemed like the most complete.  OMG, was that ever a mistake. There is so much involved between calculations, cartography and so on that the only way to have a house that fits into your ideal feng-shui "picture" is to have unlimited cash, location and placement possibilities when building your own. No way you can apply this if you are renting, especially if it's a smallish apartment or house and you don't have many different ways to set-up the space.  I think I'd MAYBE recommend this to someone who is building their ideal house and has time to look for a good place to buy land etc, basically starting from scratch with the book. Otherwise, the knowledge would be purely academic and not of much use.  If you want applicable knowledge and tips on how to set-up your house/apartment, get "Clearing the Clutter for Good Feng Shui" by Mary Lambert instead, and leave this complicated manual on the store shelf.  And as a side note: Black Hat feng shui may be considered inferior, but at least it's easy to understand, fun and inspiring. If you are interested in learning more about Black Hat feng shui, the book to get is "Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life" by Karen Rauch Carter.  When I think of our new apartment, I think about creating something that feels like home, a place to unwind and feel comfortable, a place that reflects US, not someone else. Creating your own living space should be an inspiring creative process, not a chore or something you dread. It should feel like fun, not hard work. If you agree, then this book is really not for you 
 This book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race.  There is nothing wrong with being white, just like there is nothing wrong with being black.  If you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book 
 A friend loaned me this book in an attempt to get me interested in the x-files. This book is pure junk, as is the show that it is about. I'm just tried of the lame shows of chris carter and I wish people would wise up.  This stuff is sheer garbage!! 
 My son LOVES toy story.  He has both figurines sets - the one from hasbro and the one from disney.  The hasbro set is SOOOOO much better.  In the disney set, the figurines do not have bases so several of them do not stand on their own (woody and jesse) woody's hat has separated from woody and i needed to glue it back together.  I would recommend the hasbro set over the disney one if you are debating the purchase.  overall tons of fun for the little one with the big imagination 
 This book was painfully bad.  If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore.  It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it.  Interested in the Hoover Dam?  He gets to it about two hundred pages in.  If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles.  I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak.  Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel.  
 I saw most of this movie with my children; they watching a little afternoon TV while I cleaned. I was pretty surprised to see the content of the Wicca religion, and Wicca songs about Earth Wind and Fire sung by "nice girls" with vampire teeth. They made it sound like, "Oh we are Wicca, there is nothing wrong with that!" Another reviewer mentioned that this would never be tolerated if this movie included dogma from Judaism, Islam or Catholicism. I let them finish watching, because I wanted them to see the whole thing before I explained to them that many people in the world believe that Wicca is a religious venue for witchcraft. I am not sure if they caught the whole idea about Wicca from the movie, but you know, these tiny little minds are like sponges. Next thing you know, my daughter will be casting spells saying, "but mom, I saw it on Scooby Doo!" I agree with another reviewer that it should be clearly stated on this movie that it contains content about Wicca. I only saw it on TV, which I could have turned off. What of those who spent their good money on it and found out later that it includes positive teaching about paganism.   
 After enjoying Blindness and All The Names i really looked forward for what was supposed to be the final masterpeice of a wonderful trilogy. But it seems Mr. Saramago rushed this one, the symbolism is much too obvious, the whole message of the book is clear from the beginning. After the first 40 or so pages you pretty much know what will happen and why, and what it all means and symbolizes. All this, in addition to the fact that it is unbearably boring (edit edit edit, as another reviewer wrote); the author was apparently too lazy to reread what he wrote or to revise anything, he just wrote and wrote and wrote. Too many long boring passages, tedious details and semi-philosophical monologues that go nowhere and add nothing. The whole thing feels like it was forced out of the author to satisfy the demands of his publishers and readers on time. I stopped reading somewhere in the middle of it, it's hard to enjoy a book when you feel that the author himself didn't enjoy writing it.   and one last comment, am I the only one who finds it really annoying that the publishers of Saramago's books always give you the entire storyline beginning to end on the back cover?  
 Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate. 
 This book was difficult to get through and I felt very disappointed  after reading it. Divakaruni's style of writing is good. She is quite descriptive but if felt she did a poor job with the story. I didn't care for any of the characters and still had too many questions after finishing the book. I also felt some parts of the book were drawn out too long 
 This book should only be read by master level film students highly interested in every single director, film and plot summary of every movie ever made.  There are no summaries of the main points and this book should NEVER be used as a college core classroom book.  I have never been so bored and overwhelmed by such trivial and useless information in my life 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  .. 
 in a historical romance, you don't want jarring anachronisms to distract  you from the story.  If you are constantly arguing with the author,  "Barons don't that", "That's not how people talked inthe  Regency period," "how modern!" then you cannot relax and  enjoy the story.  In addition, the writing and editing were so  scatterbrained, you would think this book had been written in one  caffeine-binge weekend.  The repetitive and banal dialogue takes enormous  effort to turn the pages.  The characters are so one-dimensional that they  are like paper dolls.  Possibly the worst writing I have ever seen  published 
 My 3 year old got this for a Christmas gift, and I thought it to be a great idea, since he loves Elmo and bathtime.  WRONG...  the darn crayons stained my bathtub!!  I had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains "almost" out.  I threw the crayons away after that.  My son likes the Elmo still, but I wouldn't recommend the crayons, especially in an older-style porcelain bathtub, like ours 
 Layout of book is really bland and examples are scant. The subject matter is interesting, but the book itself is dry- you can almost hear Ben Stein narrating when you read it. 
 I am very familiar with the courts in Santa Clara County (CA), having myself been caught up in a nasty custody battle (and other attendant battles) for 18 years.  I am also familiar with the work of Judge Stewart, (having sat in on many of his sessions) and the work of Terry Johnston (personal experience).  Below is my opinion garnered by my own personal, and extensive, experience in the very court system the two authors have 'served'.    I am not impressed.  Let me put it this way, I retained sole custody of my daughter IN SPITE OF Ms. Johnston (who was directly involved in my case), her special Masters Program and other agenda's that are at work in this County Court system.    Fortunately for me, I had a good judge who was able to see past the prejudicial treatment of my case.  Not so fortunate for others.  I had some excellent representation for about one year of my on going battles, for the other 17 I largely represented myself, so trust me, I understand what goes on.  Single mom, low income, victim of domestic violence (25 police documented incidents), vs. ex police officer husband, (remarried with 8 kids and enough money to hire many lawyers).  If Dr. Johnston had had her way, my daughter would have eventually wound up in the custody of my violent ex.  I fought against some of the best attorneys in the county, and I prevailed.    You can too.  Read the book, but if something doesn't quite feel right, follow that intuition.  If you need to know more, check out the National Coalition for Justice.  They have some very good information re: The Authors of this book.  I never joined this organization, so I have no particular agenda re: their organization, therefore I can objectively reccommend this as a good and reliable source.   Karen  
 With the exception of the appendixes, Wyn Wade has written a book so obviously biased in favor of anti-Klan propaganda tha he may as well have not done any research at all. A telling mark is the fact that Wade dedicated the book to his "Radical Republican" grandmother. Wade glosses over the horrors inflicted upon the White population of the South during the reconstruction, choosing instead to do everything but pin knighthoods on the carpetbaggers, scalawags, Yankee imperialists and their negro henchmen. Klans of later decades don't fair much better as Wade manages to portray them as either idiot yahoos or psychotics. Wade neglects to mention the many good deeds of the Klan and fails to differentiate between activity of legitimate members of the Invisible Empire and that of criminals hiding behind the orders hoods. Wade is a propagandist of the worst kind and, if there were any justice in the world, he'd be tarred and feathered and hung 
 The cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone. This cord is pure crap 
 Hello      Thank you for taking the time to read through the reviews poeple have left about M.C Ren, Kizz my black azz.     I always find it important to get other people who either own or have listen to the album your looking into buying but people do have diffrent taste in music and something somebody likes you may not, so instead of just saying " this cd is great i loved it everyone will love this cd " i try give a more detailed description on the album and which type of hiphop fan's will like this album.   M.C Ren was a rapper from compton and along with other rappers from compton joined with eazy e's group N.W.A, in 1988, Ren was first heard on the album N.W.A STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON.  His first solo album came out in 1992 which is the album you are looking into buying KIZZ MY BLACK AZZ  nothing much has changed in Ren voice since N.W.A the same style of dark, gritty lyrics and voice.  this album was brought out on Ruthless records which was eazy e's record lable so not much has changed in the production side of the album and you can bee expecting the same quality of beats as where heard in N.W.A        This was not the first M.C ren album i bought and i am sorry to say that i am glad because i would of probably not bought any more after hearing this album.            I am i huge fan of M.C Ren and do own all his albums including this one which i am sorry to say is by far his worst.       i have heard worst album in my time but i do expect a lot from Ren and i felt this album didn't deliver.      The album is a short album and is classed as EP due to it only having 6 songs which does not make the album a bad one, bone thugs first album on ruthless was only short " CREEPING ON A COME UP " but yet is one of the best albums i own.       the way the beats are put togher make's this album M.C Rens worst i feel the best beat on the album is the intro, which only lasts a few seconds after that it went down hill for me,        final frontier is a good song but only leavin 5 songs left on the album which all 4 are not much good and do not seem to catch my attention.       i would say if you are looking into a first time M.C Ren album to go for either Ruthless for life or The villian in black or Shock of the hour.all three albums are Ren at his finist and show listeners What Ren realy is about             I hope my review was helpfull and i am aware that this review may not be liked by many M.C ren fan's but please do realise that i am i ren fan and love his work and see him as a pioneer of hiphop and i am giving my oppinion on the album. please only vote yes/no if you realy did think the revie was helpfull or not.                             thank you and good luck. 
 This product is horrible!!!!! I had to send the first one back because it broke the second day that my child had it.  It took several weeks for us to get the new one and when it finally did come it broke after three days of use. 
 Author of the famed & hilarious THE MARXIST MINSTRELS (1974)...Expose of all those commie & negroid pulsating evils destroying our youth & gene pool. Some of this stuff has to be read out loud. You can regal your friends & have them rolling on the floor with a good thumping fundamentalist delivery. Hey, this guy was serious! Usual extreme right racist garbage in the Jack Van Imp mode. This guy is bout as close to God as a pig in lipstick 
 This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end.  The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people.  I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original.  
 I quite liked Alan Lakein's book, and got a lot of mileage out of it. However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world. It also holds your hand a little more (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to quickly get to the bottom of your inbox). If you (like me) are out of time and need to get organized, skip straight past Lakein and go directly to Allen 
 One of the screw treads came out of the box stripped and now the stand wobbles, i hope my key board does not fall 
 I was very excited about 'Victim in Victoria Station' and could not wait to get started.  However, I was soon disappointed.  The reason for Alan not being there was very contrived and I cannot imagine anyone rushing off to  keep an appointment after her experience on the train. There were too many  characters in the office to keep track of, especially since they were not  very relevant to the story.  The murders and motives are never explained,  yet we are taken ad nauseam through endless (fruitless?) late night  searches.  Not one of the best in the series. Missed the hats as well,  although I did enjoy the red one near the beginning 
 I have had recurring back issues for quite some time (12 years) and have done lenghty research to help aleviate pain and improve performance.  With that being said, I found this book to be entirely too basic for me.  Much of what's covered are sretches and abdominal and bicep exercises.....very little lower/upper back exercises.  If you're an athlete or somebody who's been active consistently, you probably won't find your answers in this book.  However, for older or non-exercising individuals, this book has decent basic guidlines and is decent starter information 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 Much of what is in this book is not particularly original. Every book on the market in reference to Disney Parks offers a much better summary.  I used this book on a recent trip to DisneyWorld and didn't find it useful 
 I could not get into this book.  The storyline was dull and so were the characters.  Not recommended 
 This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize a local tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from "Jaws," and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatable toy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before and during attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and scream easily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see how stupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away... Truly for lovers of below "B" grade films only 
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 After all the hype I expected this disc to be great. Boy was I wrong. I love the Wailing Souls but I cannot even listen to this. What were they thinking??? A truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios. The first track, "Row Fisherman", is such a bad version of a great song. Skip this and buy Firehouse Rock or Face the Devil. Even better try and find a copy of their first (and best) lp from 1974 
 out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny.  This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even  trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums,  Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel 
 After using this book(or better trying to use this book) I've observed, after complementing the theory that is just trying to resemble Goldstein obviusly omiting most of the theory and proposing to fill those gaps with little examples.  Exercises are poorly described maybe asuming you memorize examples, very few derivations are included most is tenth grade algebra. If you are trying to learn classical mechanics try Goldstein or Landa 
 The idea behind this isn't too bad, and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time, but it has some really ridiculous quirks. The shoes are not on any type of timer, so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually.  So what ends up happening, of course, is dead batteries within a day or so.  The wand and the tiara both work fine, so maybe that set wouldn't be too bad, but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this 
 The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error 
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 The warm family values of the Barbar series shine through, but this reader found the jumps from one famous place to another quite befuddling.  It's fine, however, for those whose ignorance of world geography is total. Coming back to Celesteville at the end is a distinct relief for both Barbar's children and the reader 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 These 'Vino Grande Chardonnay' glasses are less in volume and shorter in height than the Spiegeleau stemware previously sold under the same name.   
 This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!  This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.  This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. "But just how 'black' is he?," you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:  1. He talks different from the whites. ("Hey Bodee." "His name's Bodhi!" "Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine." Or something to that effect.)  2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)  3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)  4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)  I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.   The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.  This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.   Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. "Sphere of longiness"? Ech!  I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the "I love the 80's" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.  And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.  I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, "Prayer of the Rollerboys" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.  Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect 
 I have purchase this product few months ago for my parents. They have high blood pressure problem.  We checked the product online and trust the product description. But when we start to use it, we found that the measured values are so much diffrent than actual pressure. We follow each and every step stated to get the accurate result, but for some reason this product fails to give correct readings.  This may create serious problem because my mother got very high blood pressure even if this machine shows below normal. Do not compromise with your health 
 Beware of this book.  I purchased it believing I was getting a paperback copy of "The Professional Chef".  I waited over three months before finally getting my copy.  What a disappointment.  Instead of receiving a book filled with great tips on how to become a better chef, I get an outline of a CIA course!  Not one suggestion.  Not one how-to.  Nothing that would be of any help to anyone who was not sitting in a CIA class 
 Martha, Martha, Martha!  I thought you were on par with your brother, but I guess I was mistaken!  I am fascinated and enamored with Rufus and his repertoire, so naturally, I was willing to give Martha a good "college try".  Well, I found this music to be boring and the lyrics just not "there".  This one's going to Goodwill.  There is MAYBE one song that I would listen to again, that might grow on me over time and make it into my "rotation".  But Rufus has something indescribable, for me, that Martha just "ain't got".  I think she should stick to being backup for her brother, as their voices blend beautifully.  Martha, hat's off to you for trying to find your own voice, but you should cede the crown to your brother 
 Thomas Sowell continues his simpleminded interpretations. His so-called refutations have not changed. He is a clown. He learned obviously at an early age how to make money by proclaiming he is not Black.And he is right! He is not! 
 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 ...I told you so.  Now don't you feel silly 
 She is judging classes of people just based on her personal experiences. Not very Christian-like.  Using her stories as some kind of template for the rest of society does more harm than good, and it seems to me like this lady's primary concern is for having a voice, not spreading the word of God, not doing God's will, and certainly not helping America's poor.  
 I haven't read this book.  I won't read this book. I don't need to read this book.  Here someone has the audacity to compare the Harry Potter books with Tolkien's huge achievement; anyone who would think there is anything worth comparing is dull-witted.  This has been written to make $. Ignore it, good people 
 i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one. 
 Sometimes mentioned as one of the "banned books of the bible", the Book of Jubilees covers the same ground as Genesis and part of Exodus. It's one of the books of the Pseudepigrapha, which means "writings with false superscription", according to the introduction. I found it boring and difficult to read. It shares a similarity with the Oahspe bible in one instance, where Abraham is instructed to kill Isaac by an evil spirit ("prince of the Mastema"), and he doesn't because he realises that it's a spirit and not God communicating with him. It includes fragments of old texts such as the Book of Noah and there's more reference to Enoch than in Genesis.  Overall, I would recommend it only to obsessive or completist students/scholars of the Old Testament 
 Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
 A beautiful looking cookbook, certainly. I was very excited to try the recipes after receiving the book for Xmas. But what a disappointment. Tried 14 different recipes with fellow baking friends over the course of a week. They weren't bad, but we six bakers let out collective "ho-hums" with each 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 I love Dr. Rosenfield, but this is a useless book. Sorry, doc 
 Having basically loved the previous film; "Cool Air", I was greatly displeased with this particular volume. Being a big HPL-fan since as far back as I can remember, I have always looked forward to the day when good film-adaptations of HPL's literary work would come out. Let me assure you, this was NOT worth the wait. I should tell you that I am unfamiliar with the whole "Delta Green" phenomenon, which I'm told the main feature on the DVD is a spawn of, so I might not be qualified to judge the contents, but I'll give it a shot. I am very familiar with HPL and the "Call of Cthulhu"-RPG, so I will never understand this desire to change and twist his tales so much, just to be able to film it. The way I feel (and many others) is that if you have to change his stories a lot in the making of your film, then perhaps you should just stop right there, and find something else to do, because IMO the stories are like what they were meant to be.  The main feature "Rough Magik" is the first episode of an intended series from England that I don't think were made into more than a pilot, this particular episode was set in the Falkland Islands during the Falklands-war. It is only vaguely "Lovecraftian" in any sense, and I felt it had very little to do with HPL, even though it was not poorly made, I can't see why they would put it on a HPL-DVD!   The only positive extra on the disc is the included part II of the interview with Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi, but sadly here Joshi starts ranting about HPL's racialism, saying that HPL "should have changed his views", because it was folly by Lovecraft according to the Indian miscegenating immigrant (biased anyone?) not to listen to the non-scientific rants coming from the anthropological school of Franz Boas (for an excellent refutation of Boas' work, see Dr. Kevin Macdonald - "The Culture Of Critique" available here at Amazon).  The other short films are a Canadian version of "The Terrible Old Man", this time set in contemporary times, and having horrible effects and acting. I enjoyed the swinging souls in the bottles, (jars used for storing jam in this particular film, but oh well...) but that's about it. The other is a very amateurish adaptation of "From Beyond", with a few nice special effects, but the acting was simply not my cup of tea. Others might feel differently about these short films, but from my point of view they were not very well made.   Another VERY annoying thing with the film is that the sound is so low! I had to turn the volume up like 2/3 more than usual. For some reason they also decided to include some horrible "rock music" on the disc, which was so bad I'm taking away a star just because of this. What on earth does this stuff have to do with HPL?!   One and a half thumb down 
 Contributors to this fine anthology of male authors would be far better served without the unnecessary and cloying tailpieces tacked onto their work by Author-Publisher Sarah Ban Breathnach. The jacket photo of foxy Sarah tells it all. The girl's gotta have the last word 
 I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today. 
 Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers 
 I just finished reading Angry Black White Boy.  It seemed like a good premise, but could have been a lot better.  The writing style is so poor, with such tenous logic, that any points that the author makes about racism are weakened.  The characters are two-dimensional and don't behave like real people.  They just serve to move the plot from point A to point B.  So many of the characters are thin stereotypes that the overall message is dilluted.  The main character, named Macon, is the "downest" white guy ever.  He seems to be an embarrassing alter-ego for the author (who has some hip-hop album reviews on his web site if you want a sample his writing style).  Macon is not exactly a hero, but something of an Eminem among black political leaders.  Macon's political message is somewhat ambivalent, and it's easy to lose interest in his character halfway through.  The ending is ridiculous and ruins the story.  Mansbach's overall writing style can be downright embarrassing.  He's overly earnest in his attempt at hipness.  He often uses bad poetry slam writing full of paens to hip-hop, with cringe-inducing use of words like "pimpstrut" as a verb.  The book also includes fictional segments from the memoir of an early negro baseball player, but they're written in a revisionist style that's way out of touch with the writing of that time.  It's another fatal error that prevents the book from ringing true.  I wanted to like this book, and found some of the observations on racial identity to be very acute, but overall it just doesn't work.  A writer like Gore Vidal, for example, can write about controversial subjects like this with absurdity and insight, but Adam Mansbach just doesn't succeed.  For a better book on racism, skip Angry Black White Boy and just read Richard Wright's novel Black Boy instead (or any of the many such books by prominent black authors who actually know what they're talking about, unlike Mr. Mansbach) 
 You are better off just buying a cook and telling her to give you exactly X amount of calories a day. This diet is ridiculous and mostly inconvient 
 My timer didn't work either.  It arrived broken in two pieces, and even though I was able to put it back together, it just didn't work.  Back it went.  It's cute, but pretty much useless 
 If it were possible to give an author zero stars, I would have.  This book is seriously flawed for two reasons:  First, Ms. Shamblin has a very limited if not confused understanding of Christian doctrine.  For example, she rejects the concept of the Holy Trinity and uses many fallacious arguments to support her beliefs.  I don't feel comfortable reading anything written by a supposed Christian with this brand of faith.  Second, her main principles for losing weight include only eating when physically hungry and stopping eating when full.  The majority of people suffering from overeating don't care if they are hungry or full or not.  They eat for other reasons, including but not limited to numbing fears, dealing with resentments or to forget past relationship issues.  Compulsive Overeaters, of which I am one, will not only eat when they are not hungry, but will continue to eat far beyond feeling full -- sometimes to the point of physical pain and discomfort.  I truly believe that faith, especially Christianity, can help those suffering from overeating, because recovery from overeating requires physical, emotional and spiritual recovery.  But this book and "The Weigh Down" movement is NOT the one to help you do this.  Your best bet is to find an Overeaters Anonymous meeting in your area and start going to their meetings instead 
 Perl Pocket Reference only gives lists and tables.  No explanation of how to use the various functions, variables, etc.  Definitely not for new-comers.  I was very disappointed by this pocket reference.  I was expecting something more like the very high quality "Python Pocket Reference", which manages to give complete description of the language, all functions, standard modules, etc, ALONG WITH EXAMPLES FOR EACH; The Python Pocket Reference is able to be used as a standalone reference.  This is definitely not true for the Perl Pocket Reference; You will need other books to make this pocket reference make sense... what a pain 
 The conservative mindset seems to be that 'liberals' are as monolithic in their views as conservatives and unlike conservatives who are honest and good are a pack of rotten liars.  If you can buy into that basic notion, you might enjoy the book.  Otherwise, watching the author knock down straw men could be a little dull. One thing to keep in mind while reading this book is that the core of conservative belief is an irrational personality cult.  I recall during the 2000 election telling liberals why I did not like Gore.  They would respond, "Yes, but..."  If I tried the same thing with conservatives about Bush or Cheney, they would shriek at me, some refusing to speak with me again.   It has become a major concern now for conservatives to cloak their views in the costume of rationality.  This author hopes to cash in on this trend.  I am sure the book will be successful.  Obviously, it presupposes that conservatives are right on everything.  Even when they are clearly wrong, their choices are supposedly so well thought out that anyone who disagrees with them is a liar or a fool.  I suppose this is like Holland's tulip mania.  Eventually it will burn itself out but it will never quite go away 
 I fell in love with their song "Experimental Film," and since this was TMBG's first CD, and had such great reviews, I bought it without listening to it.  While I acknowledge their creativity, I just can't get into any of the music on this CD.  I'm not saying don't buy this CD, as obviously many people really like it.  Just give it a listen before you buy so you know what you're getting 
 First of all, Rufus Wainwright's vocals are extremely annoying throughout a MAJORITY of this album. I REALLY, REALLY tried to enojoy it, but his voice inevitably blends into this muddled mess of sound that requires a focused concentration to understand.  The only real exception is on track 1 where he manages to create an interesting sound with his voice.  Secondly, the production on this album is terrible. The tracks don't know when to end. Each track goes on, and on, and on......and when you think it's gonna end, the song goes on some more. I love long tracks, but give me something to listen to. The various layers on each song simply cover each other and create a listening clusterf&*k as opposed to complementing each other to form a unique and enjoyable listening experience. (Listen to 'The Fragile', compare, and you'll understand completely.)  Finally, Rufus Wainwright's lyrics (on THIS album) do absolutely nothing for me. They are extremely boring, meandering, and do not hold my attention for more than about 15 seconds. Honestly the only lyrics on this album I remember are 'bread crumbs in the big black forest'. (repeated about 100 times)  I understand some of you will hate this review because you think this album is fantastic. But, I ASSURE YOU, there is an abundance of music (in various genres) waiting to be heard that is, quite simply, MUCH BETTER. So start looking and I hope you find something you WILL LOVE soon 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 This is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college--imitations of what's on the shelf right now, only "smarter," which really just means "condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite Marin County." But you shouldn't be surprised--the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self-absorption (even if she wants to pretend this is a novel: novels have PLOTS, honey). Bypass this and read some Dorothy Parker instea 
 and THEN come follow  Jesus orders us when someone asks for our coat to give our shirt as well.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to get into heaven. Or a capitalist. Jesus said it, not me.  Capitalism is the opposite of Christianity. Study carefully the National Conference of Catholic Bishop's landmark letter Economic Justice for All which damns corporate capitalism as currently practiced under the unelectable Bush regime.   Read the Rev. Father John Dear, SJ. Anything he wrote. Read the most saintly and Catholic Dorothy Day. Winess her life of Chritian witness.  Capitalists cannot be Christian. There is no profit in it. If someone wants your money you give it to them, with a joyful and sincere smile.  Read your Dorothy Day, the greatest American CAtholic EVER! Loaves and Fishes is a good place to start. She said not to give our old clothes to the poor; give them our new clothes instead.  Go back and read your Saint Francis too. What did he say? How did he read and live the Gospel? What did he have?  What would Jesus do? Amass wealth? What did he have when he died?  Even Karl Marx got it closer when quoting Saint Paul that the Christian Community derived from each member according to their talents and gave to each member according to their needs.  This is the OPPOSITE of capitalism which bleeds everyone through their needs (health, housing, food, education, clothing, etc.) and in which the rich alone get richer.  That ain't Christianity by any measure.  Christ leads to true freedom. Not capitalism. Meanwhile: Is the West a success?   And those who believe the hierarchcal church promoted the scientific method need only remember it was not a quarter century the church apologized to the late Galileo, and as recently as the pioneering (ought to be saint) Father Gregor Mendel the church burned his notebooks posthumously and prohibited his publication, of what has now become the basis of biology: genetic codes. 
 I frankly had never heard of the awful race riot in Tulsa on May 31 and June 1, 1921.  This account is slipshoddily written by a journalist, not by a historian.  The book has no footnotes and no real bibliography.  So much of the account is devoted to guessing and while the book is rightly sympathetic to the black victims the account often lapses into juvenilistic maudlin journalism.  The story is important, the event is full of horrific atrocities by white people, but the telling is not done well.  Instead of expatiating on how awful things were I would far rather the author had laid out the facts, complete with footnotes.  ...I simply have no faith that this account is objective and accurate.  Sorry.  I see there are other books dealing with the event.. 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 This book (The Return of anti-Semitism) is merely a catalog of the rise in modern anti-Semitism. It ultimately fails deeply and thoroughly by not even attempting to explain the reasons for anti-Semitism or the solutions to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the author even seems quite proud to brag about not knowing the reasons or solutions. It is as if he is so horror struck at the mere thought of anti-Semitism that he feels his only job is to point it out so that the whole world too can be equally horror struck with guilt. Being horror struck, however, is not a sensible or just policy.     It's true that in America we are still horror struck and guilty about anti-Semitism, largely as a result of our particular moral disgust at the German holocaust. Accordingly we always support the Israeli gov't, although nobody really knows where this policy came from or why we pursue it despite the world wide hatred toward us that it has engendered, and the direct connection to 9/11. We don't dare risk sounding anti-Semitic by suggesting  that if we had supported a just peace (internationally built and defended wall at internationally recognized borders) in the Middle East rather than blindly supported the Israeli occupation, 9/11 would probably not have happened. After all, the terrorist are over here because we're over there.       When Likud came to power in Israel they openly swore Israel would no longer be a "dwarf state" and that they were not occupying the West Bank but rather liberating Judea and Sumeria according to Biblical prophesy. Much of Israel does not support this blatantly imperialist, racist policy; yet America does out of a blind dumb fear of being or feeling anti-Semitic. You can admire us a little for being so sweet,  but how practical  is our sweetness and dumbness when directly and indirectly it caused 9/11 and makes us hated by much of the world? As long as we blindly give Israel the weapons to kill Muslims in the West Bank how can we blame Muslims for thinking of us as Western Crusaders or Zionist occupiers, and much of the rest of the world for hating us as Texas sized bullies?     The author completely ignores the core issues causing much of modern anti-Semitism and the possible solutions, because he prefers to manipulatively capitalize on the Holocaust guilt that has served Likud's deadly occupation of the Muslim West Bank so well. We can no longer blindly pretend, as this author does, that modern anti-semitism can exist separately from American's and Israel's 50 year war against the Muslim West Bank 
 I am always interested in the intellectual history of science, particularly the Faustian dilemma.  Often we want to sell our souls to the devil for an article or a grant.  For scientists in Nazi Germany, the Faustian dilemma was to sacrifice their Jewish friends and colleagues on the altar of Nazism. Hundreds of careers were made this way.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  First, to fill the first hundred pages, Cornwell spends way too much time discussing WWI without any real connection to the ideological development on Nazi science and the danger of scientists who embraced Nazism fully.    Second, Cornwell deals rather efficiently, without finesse or surprises for that matter, with the usual array of popularized accomplishments of Nazi science during the war.  The book reads as a companion guide to a documentary on the History channel.  Stories of V1 and V2, zyklon B, radio navigation, and the A-bomb have been told better before.    Third, the book avoids the "big" moral and scientific dilemma in Nazi science: Lebensraum.  When the Third Reich occupied Poland, it relied heavily on economic analysis on the economic viability of the occupation.  Economists and sociologists walked hand in hand to analyze the most efficient way to occupy that country and to extract its human, capital, industrial, and agricultural resources.  Cornwell mentions the economic analysis of the viability of concentration camps, but that is only a small proportion on how social sciences supported the Nazi ideology.   Fourth, it was hardly surprised then that genetic experiments in the concentration camps are glossed over in the book.  Benno Muller-Hill is reduced to being a reference.    Fifth, the most glaring omission is the role of social sciences, which I tangentially mentioned earlier.  During the 1930s an entire generation of new academic social scientists were "manufactured" to benefit, polish, improve, and offer scientific backing to the emerging Nazi ideology.  In less than 15 years, history, sociology, economics, linguistics, geography, and political science were rewritten and reanalyzed by this committed cadre of bright, young Nazis.  Following the end of the war, these still young academics were not removed.  Although many of them wholeheartedly embraced Nazism, they were able to keep their academic appointments, except for a few of the older guard.  They sold their soul as much as the younger group; few of them were removed and some became marginalized not because they were Nazis.  Those who kept their academic positions served as teachers, professors, and advisors to a new class of students. Few of these academics retired before the 1970s and they dominated the German intellectual contribution in social sciences for over 50 years from Nazism to social democracy.  
 These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD 
 This is a great book but not if, like me, you want to know 'why?'. If you're a professional and you're moving to FCP from using some other professional editing software then this is probably the book you need. But if you need to learn about FCP from the ground up then try the Revolutionary Final Cut Pro 3 book. It starts at the basics and tells you why you'd do something and explains it the way that I like 
 The mystery of the broadcast from no-man's-land is solved by page 174.  That leaves about 110 more pages of melodramatic romance and a a somewhat shallow description of how the people end their lives as the inevitable radiation poisoning takes hold.  I would have liked more treatment of submarine operations--one of the cruises only takes about two pages.  If you're looking for a maritime mystery story this isn't it.  The romantical treatment of the young family might be a culture difference--Shute repeatedly refers to the infant as "it."  There are some continuity problems, as Shute was evidently unfamiliar with radio terminology despite years developing "secret weapons for the British in World War II:" in two facing pages, the frequency of the mysterious transmission is either 4.92 megacycles or 4.92 kilocycles.  Similarly, the descriptions of some of the dead (falling out of a latrine, sitting at a year-long cocktail party) are also puzzling given the nearby blasts.  More curiously are the dead people in the American town whom the deserted sailor found poisoned in their beds but that in that area death would have been very immediate and not as convenient as the slow, anticipated deaths in Melbourne.  I rather disliked the bland story of the scientist-turned-race-car-driver that was seemingly bolted into the book about halfway though.  I suppose the author wanted to stuff more pages or perhaps an early reading of his manuscript left out some crucial third-party character.  Still, I haven't read a book in three days' time in many years.  It's a compelling page-turner, but after page 174 I had a hard time dragging myself through the rest of it 
 I never trust a book that spends the entire first chapter telling you what you will learn from the book.  And it only got worse, it seems like the authors spent most of their "ink" telling us what we were going to learn.  There was some useful info, but it could have been offered in a 3 pages pamphlet. 
 Is it just me, or do all Sting's new songs these days sound basically the same?  I've loved Sting's quirky, compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as I can remember, from early Police through to 'Ten Summoner's Tales' - but every time I listen to one of the newer albums, I just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision.  I don't WANT Sting to make Part 2 of 'Turtles' or 'Summoner' (artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to) but I miss the clever playfulness of 'Englishman' or 'Heavy Cloud', the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'Soul Cages' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'Fragile' or 'Fields of Gold' - I miss the way the music and words *worked* together, and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough, or a cleverer musical joke than you'd initially caught.    The point is, 'Sacred Love', 'Brand New Day' - and even 'Mercury Falling' - could have been made by ANYONE - there just isn't anything that separates these songs (okay, except maybe 'Desert Rose' and 'Thousand Years') from easy listening elevator music, nothing that makes them Sting's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video.  Even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'This War' is certainly no 'Russians' (even discounting the brilliantly quoted Prokofiev theme), and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen, as opposed to letting it play in the background.    On the plus side, I am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of Elizabethan songs - Sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge, and I'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music.  But I'll still miss the old Sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and I'll continue to live in hope 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
    Another anxiety-driven media clown with nothing remotely clever to say.  Save your money. 
 ... I found this version of Alice almost unwatchable. Previous reviews well capture this version's character, including its truly fatal flaws. Please read them. But I think they are by-and-large far too charitable. I love Carroll's works, so do not take this negative review as a knock on the Alice books; it is purely about this dismal and moribund adaptation.  Note, I write "adaptation." This is not a faithful version of Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," nor was meant to be. Fair enough. But wherever there was any mirth or joy in Carroll's book (which is itself slightly dark), producer/director Miller has replaced it with a cringe-worthy combination of sleep-inducing sonambulism on Alice's part, and obscure and pretentious dated social commentary on the part of other characters. It simply doesn't work in America in 2007, and I doubt it worked even in England in 1966.  There *are* bright spots, to be sure, as others have mentioned: Sir Michael Redgrave's Caterpillar, Peter Cook's Hatter, and--for me the best and only not-depressing part of the film--Sir John Gielgud's Mock Turtle. But these cannot make up for what is otherwise a perhaps noble effort, but simply no fun.  As jammer wrote, "The director never seems to get enough of having interminable full-face close-ups of [Alice], whose visage is devoid of expression or reaction and during which, little if anything else happens to advance the rest of the story. (Meanwhile all this precious screen time goes down the tubes when it could have been used so profitably elsewhere! Aarrgggghhhh!) Lewis Carroll, whose whole focus revolved around Alice, must surely have turned over in his grave."  Just so, and, as Alice says, "At any rate, I'll never go *there* again!"  (Note: my nearly three year old daughter is entirely in love with KCRW's radio/CD version of Alice [available for purchase only at kcrw.org, I think], and listens to it over and over. She is surely not the target audience of this disturbing version, but I thought she'd at least want to watch it *once*. She couldn't even make it through a single viewing. It's simply "too dark--too dark altogether." 
 I don't want to think Elvis fans are only hicks without computers, but I'm starting to get that picture (myself excluded, lol). Why is everyone voting no on the posts that say this disc wont play on computers? This disc will not play in my computer and I am overseas with the troops so thanks a lot BMG Sony. This should be a MAJOR issue for consumers now that things like I Pods and mp3 players (that is what I also use) are becoming more popular. I'm stuck with a disc that I can't use on the media that I use, just be aware before you buy this, I tried alternate players and the disc is not even recognized in the drive. Luckily I followed the advice at electronic freedom foundation and disabled autoplay on my drive before I attempted to play this because it also may have put a rootkit on my cpu leaving it open to attacks. I hope BMG Sony get their arses sued to DEATH over this and that it is a lesson to them not to do this crap without some notices (I don't see anything anywhere on this disc that it wont play on a computer). I have bought a TON of music on Amazon because being in the middle east it's my main form of entertainment, I'm not a hacker or ripping off people but if I want to share this music with my family I should be allowed to do that, shouldn't I? Or how about just play the freaking disc? This is total crap and I'm pissed I hope I get one of those class action lawsuit things in the mail and make some lawyers very rich! BMG Sony if they are worried about profits should focus on talent and let the marketplace decide whats good not PAYOLA AND SCREWED UP DISCS! Amazon needs to take a stand in this too since they are computer related (they only do business on the internet, that's their claim to fame), how do you feel Amazon about selling music that won't play in your customers computers? I don't see any warnings on this site, just user comments. Amazon better take a stand or they are going down a notch in my book.    
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 i read this more as an essay and commentary regarding prewar england.  themes of church intollerance, school rigidity, classism, bigotry, etc. abound.  one can read this literally, leaving the task confused and befuddled.  one should read this metaphorically, perhaps as a dream sequence, to fairly appreciate what orwell sought to accomplish.  i enjoyed elements of this for the sheer brilliance of observation.  life at the hops camp was particularlly sharp.  if one appreciates gritty labor struggles and observations of the religiously constrained, this will be a pile of words worth reading 
 I'm frankly a little surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book.  I was intrigued by the story at the beginning, but as it unfolded, the characters seemed more and more wooden and the dialogue became laughable.  If I had to hear Mrs. Weber call her daughters "my little fleas" one more time, I vowed to stop reading.  I finally ended up skimming the last 50 pages to end my misery, as I really didn't care what happened to the shallow characters.  I think Stephanie Cowell has the potential to be a good descriptive writer, but somehow this story fell painfully flat.  Kudos to her for the underlying idea, which was a creative approach to telling the tale of Mozart.  I would not, however, recommend this book to those who desire a more lyrical--and believable--read 
 This book is not a great value.  It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's "German Quickly" or even Sandburg and Wendell's "German for Reading."  It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence.  Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them.  This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes 
 I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.  The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.  However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).  Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness. 
 Most of the tracks are severely clipped. You can do a better job than this with the vinyl and a PC. Very disappointing 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 This book is a laugh a minute, mainly because of the author's total inattention to detail.  His 'German' is appalling, the plot a farce (including a dead mobile phone suddenly springing into life) and as for 'villages' in Australia being destroyed - that is the worst because we DO NOT have any villages in this country.  Large and small towns, yes, but no villages.  As for the two boring heroines beating the best hitmen ever ... oh well.  Some people might like it.    
 I wanted to like this book.  I love Sagas of Icelanders.  I was ecstatic over the Poetic Edda.  Snorri's "Prose Edda" was frequently mentioned in my other reading, and I decided I would have to check it out.  What a disappointment. I must clarify that by saying that the Prose Edda is an EXTREMELY important book of immense value to students of Medeival literature (specifically Scandinavian / Norse / Icelandic.)  It is the single most complete record of  Norse mythology which we have today, and along with the Poetic Edda, constitutes practically the sole source of material for all books which re-tell the mythological stories.  But the Edda is, unfortunately, a book to be read only for the value of the information it contains; not for entertainment.  All of the interesting material in the Edda is re-told (in much more readable ways) elsewhere.  Snorri himself, in the course of this book, re-tells "Voluspa" (from the Poetic Edda) and gives a brief synopsis of the Volsunga Saga. Edda was written as a handbook for poets and scholars, to aid in understanding ancient Scandinavian poetry, which was thick with mythological allusions. Edda also provides guidelines for composing new poems using traditional forms.  It was written two or three centuries into the Christian era of northern Europe, when old pagan lore was already nearly forgotten.  Snorri's book kept his ancestor's cultural heritage from disappearing completely.  He treats the old myths very kindly, but is careful to throw in the obligatory Christian warnings about "false religion."  According to "Gylfaginning," (the first and most interesting part of the Edda) the Norse gods - the Aesir - were originally a tribe of people who migrated to the North from Turkey.  They were veterans of the Trojan War (!) so cultured and technologically advanced that they were regarded as gods by the ignorant folk in the lands they conquered and settled.  According to Snorri, most of the mythological stories are analogous to episodes from the Iliad. The second section of the Edda is called "Skaldskaparmal" and it is very tedious.  It consists of a mythological discussion between Aegir (the sea god) and Bragi (the god of poetry) in which Bragi explains various kinds of kennings.  A kenning is a poetic figure of speech in which a person or object is referred to by describing it in terms of another person or object.  Then that secondary person or object can be referred to by yet another substitute, down to 4 or 5 levels of circumlocution, all of which has to be figured out by the listener to determine exactly what the poet is talking about.  Kennings are like riddles, allegories, metaphors, and allusions rolled all into one.  A fairly detailed myhtological background is required to make sense of them - thus, the reason for the Edda.  A few stories are told which explain some kennings, but gradually Snorri loses track of the "conversation" that initially provided structure for this section, and the reader gets mired amidst interminable lists of poetic synonyms for swords, ships, gold, and so on.  Quotes from old poems illustrate the use of many of the kennings. The translator - for reasons which are certainly valid - opted to render all of the verse as prose, preserving its literal meaning [with allegorical meanings choppily inserted in square brackets,] but utterly detroying its power as POETRY. The final section is called "Hattatal" and it consists of a few verse quotations and three original poems composed by Snorri himself in a different style for each verse, with sections of prose in between stanzas to explain the technical details (rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc) of each style.  There's a total of 102 verses in the Hattatal, and the poetry here is actually somewhat interesting; more so, at least, than the nuts-and-bolts discussion of the fine points of skaldic composition.  In this section, each verse is presented in the original Old Icelandic (with modernized spelling) with English translation underneath. At the end of this volume, the translator has provided a handy eight-page summary that will tell you what you missed and/or forgot as you slogged in a bleary-eyed daze through Skaldskaparmal and Hattatal.  There's also an alphabetical index of names so you can look up things and use the Edda for what it was intended to be: a reference book. I'm glad I read it, I guess, since I am pretty "into" this kind of thing ... but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just curious about Norse mythology.  Sure, this book is "the Source" but you'll have more fun reading one of the dozens of more recent re-tellings 
 I've  made >20 visits to France all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the Metro.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  
 I marvel at the origins of marvel comics. This man is such a liar!Does  Stan Lee have no shame? If you really want to know how Marvel Comics came  to be,read some background on one Mr.Jack Kirby.For Stan Lee to say that he  would come up with an idea then pass it along to Jack Kirby is not only  ludicrous but also peposterous.Stan Lee also fails to mention many artists  who where also working at the Marvel bullpen at the time.Many artist who  where working at Marvel at the time have gone on to state that Stan Lee  never wrote a single story!! The way the artist of the day would go about  writing a story would be by writing it along the borders and making it up  as they went along.If this is true,then Jack Kirby created the entire line  of characters for Marvel Comics.Many of the more important ones any  ways.The Incredible Hulk,Captain America,The Fantastic Four,Thor,The  X-Men,And The Avengers to name a few.And also not to mention the cover to  Amazing Fantasy #15.When Stan Lee states very proudly that the idea for The  Fantastic Four was all his ,it upsets me.If you are really a true comic  book fan then you would know that the Fantastic Four are just recycled  characters from Simon and Kirby's Challengers Of The Unknown.Which , I  might add was published for D.C.Comics and not for Marvel.Jack Kirby was an  artist and an idea man when he and Joe Simon collaborated together.These  two men came up with many characters and many ideas together.At least Mr.  Simon had the decency to admit it.But the same cannot be said for Stan  Lee,he and he alone wants to take credit for the creation of Marvel Comics  most memorable heroes.This book is filled with nothing but self  glorification and staight out lies put to paper by Stan Lee.Excelsior my  foot,how about expell yourself?Very little is said about Simon &  Kirby's creation of Captain America for Marvel comics in the forty's. Stan  Lee didn't even work for Marvel Comics at the time that Captain America  made his comic book debut!! Origins of Marvel Comics also speaks very  little about Steve Ditko,Don heck,and John Romita Sr. some of comicdoms  most famous artists.This book fails to aknowledge the contributions they  also made for Marvel Comics.But then again I guess that's the way Stan Lee  wanted it when he wrote this book.I belieive this book did very much  damadge to Jack Kirby's carreer.To this day he is not given the proper  credit he so rightly deserves.The way Marvel Comics treated Jack Kirby can  be compared to the exile of Moses from Egypt in wich his name must forever  be stricken from it's books and never be spoken again! I wouldn't recommend  purchasing this book but if you do,go right out and buy some material to  compare notes and then make your decision about the Origins Of Marvel  Comics . Pick up The art of Jack Kirby for refference because there was  never really  a "Marvel Age Of Comics,"there was only a  "Jack Kirby Age Of Comics." If you wish to send me your comments  or opinions send them to 3019 s. Poplar Ave. Chicago Illinois 60608.KIRBY  POWER!! and STAY ROMITALIZED! 
 It grieves me to trash this book given the immense talent of the author as a translator. There is simply nothing in the book of interst. It reads like the traval diary of a highschool student with about as much insight as one  would expect from an inexperienced young person. Contrary to some of the  reviews, it doesn't provide insight into the Neapolitan character any more  than describing the color of an apple tells you anything about how it  tastes 
 while the history of Roger Bacon was interesting and the  other historic figures(Aristotle, Soccrates, etal) I was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest. Instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted, political climates and philosophies. This is nice background but it could have been shortened, in this reader's humble opinion.   If you want to know more about the Manuscript, look to another book. 
 I have read Mr. Train's earlier books The Money Masters and The New Money Masters and found them informative and interesting, gaining insights from some of the worlds most sucessful investors. Mr. Train's research seemed to rely heavily on personal interviews of these Masters often providing the reader with unique investment philosophies  not readily available elsewhere. I especially recommend Mr. Train's first book in this series The Money Masters because this book moved me away from the trading of stocks and futures as practiced by Robert Wilson the short seller and Stanly Kroll the great commodity speculator. The techniques they employed seemed too elusive and fraught with risk and if this was the basis of the trading game it was not the game for me. I was instead attracted to the similer philosophies of mentor and student Ben Grahman and Warren Buffett. Looking at a stock as a share of a business not a piece of paper with a number on it. This   was the first time I had been exposed to the wisdom of these two investors and I am grateful to Mr. Train for revealing to the public their methods. The problem I have with the current rendition is that it really adds nothing new. In fact Mr. Train seems to have copied parts of the first Money Masters and spliced them into this version. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem that the effort or creativity that went into the original went into this work. Another sort of irritating quality in this instance thankfully not present in the first book is Mr. Train's need to psychoanalyze some of his subjects especially Mr. Buffett. This adds an edge to the book that is not worthy of Mr. Train 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this 
 How disappointing. I was eager to receive this book and as it only took about 45 minutes to read from front to back, I didn't put it down because I kept thinking that there had to be some redeeming value. Some useful tidbit of information that I as a person who has never catered anything could use. There was not one thing in this book that someone with common sense wouldn't think of themselves. There appears to be only one reason this book was written. The author had enjoyed being a caterer and when she left the field to raise her son, she needed money. I'm only sorry that she didn't put more effort and thought into it 
 I was expecting a little bit more detailed instruction.  This book leaves a beginner(at least this one)a little bit at sea 
 The bedlams that greet the current Republican Administration each morning for USA `involvement in Iraq' have actually relegated this DVD to second-rate. It is obvious that the producers of this so called `Documentary' are more likely to be fractious to Mr. Bush in particular than accommodating to the American public at large. It is also obvious that Mr Bush is not the type of person to succumb to self-pity. Mr Moore must be happier receiving ready cash from the other camp though.  In the meantime I can still see very long queues moving slowly waiting for the full truth behind 9/11 to unfold.   
 We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).    On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.    But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers 
 Joseph Arthur's latest effort substantially lacks the sublime ambience of his previous endeavors.  One can listen to "In Ohio" over and over and over while continuously marveling at its beauty.  It's terribly unfortunate that no other song on this album emanates a similar raw, aesthetic element which is immediately apparent on Arthur's past travels 
 Why do authors do this to books. This book could have been really good but what does Linsey do she makes our hero a Cad. Nicholas and Regina have good chemistry and the story was rolling along just fine until after the wedding. Nicholas oh sweet Nicholas decides to dump his new wife at their estate and take off on a extended trip. How long you ask well as long as he sees fit. You see Nicholas has a secret. A stupid one at that. He was born on the wrong side of the blanket and he fears telling Regina. So takes another route and leaves. Wow he's a smart one. He thinks Regina won't understand. Hello her cousin Derick is illegitiment. You thinks she would accept it quite easily ,well that and she loves you. But you see Nicholas is a cad and not so bright. And when he decides to come back she has a little suprise for him. But does he get better, oh no that would be to easy for the author so he stays a cad alittle longer and finally at the end (know I won't tell you even tho it's not worth telling any how) he redeems himself. Yes its sad for this reader to tell you it only took our "HERO" 1 page to do all that redeeming. Even tho it was pages on end of him being a jerk. Don't bother with this one if you like your romance to be full of love, caring, deeper understanding of one another. 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 This review is purposely overly harsh in an effort to achieve a counter-balance.  In truth, it deals with one, inexcusible, chapter re: The Great Queen [i.e. The Morrighan].  He *really* fummbled the ball, here (and that's being generous!).  Having read nearly all of the books listed in these authors' Bibiography, I firmly disagree with their interpretations of The Morrighan, entirely.  In essence, they seem to have been imposing their views onto the evidence at hand.  Further insulting was the way in which they extended an olive branch to Medb in an effort to completely excuse Her from War-Goddess status.  However, they refuse to extend the same grace to The Morrighan when, according to the Medieval concepot of war-fare [inter-tribal catle raids] Medb is more of a War-Goddess than The Morrighan will ever be!  Most scholars, today, seem to be referring to Her not as a War-Goddess, but as one of the following: Tutelary-/Sovereign-/Earth-Goddess.  In fact, recent academic articles by one Maire Herbert have exploded this out-dated War-Goddess model as it's applied to The Morrighan.  This out-dated model is, unfortunately, the result of early Classicist idealogy being imposed onto non-Classical Gods and Goddesses (this model stems ONLY from one article written in 1870, and has stuck ever sense, unquestioned, and undefied erroniously-so by Pagans).  He further insults any well-informed reader by calling Her a "Battle Fury" (scholars are unanimously firm in their belief that She never actually engages in battle).  Some other choice descriptions (which are abhorantly over-stepping the bounds of all reasonable research) are: She is a Goddess of a severe psychotic episodes, and that She is the personification of the cool, calculated, mentality of a serial killer!  None of this is borne out via the research!  I suggest that ANYONE interested in researching Her, turn to the following scholars (he referenced only to the last text listed, and seemed to have ignored that the author was emphatic in stating that She is an Earth-Goddess; others state She is also from a Mother-Goddess Cult, too):  * The Witch Figure -- Ed. V. Newall [Contains an article by Dr. Anne Ross] * The Concept of the Goddess -- Ed. Miranda Green [contains two academic articles by two Irish scholars which define Her as an Earth-Goddess, a genius loci, and one even blowing a part the War-Goddess model, Aspect, with no answers possible!] * The Celtic Hgeroic Age -- Ed. & Trans. John Carey & John Koch [Often defines The Morrighan strictly AS Anann, the Irish Mother-Goddess.] * The Great Queens: Irish Goddesses from the Morrighan to Cathleen Ni Houlihan -- Rosalind Clark [She has some excellent info. re: The Morighan as an Earth-/Tutelary-/Fertility-/Cow-/Sovereignty-Goddess.] * War Goddess: THe Morrighan & Her Germano-Celtic Counterpart -- Angelique Epstein [Still a good text, even though she relies far too heavily upon the now out-dated War-Goddess model; she puts Irish "warfare" into it's propper perspective, which is truly alien to the modern Pagan re: what we concieve of as "war".] * The Ancient Celts -- Barry Cunliffe  The utter nerve that he would dare state this chapter as objective research is insulting to academia, as well as to Pagans, who are taking them at their word!  His clear, unthinking bias (and hypocricy when the Medb chapter is taken into account), is clear, and unforgivible to this Pagan (and researcher)!  I don't trust him as a researcher.  In fact, his views concernign academia are lacking, for example, re: Ronald Hutton.  He doesn't understand so much about the academic community, and that Hutton is often mistaken re: his personal assumptions.  But, McColman merely writes any of his critics off (who question anything he writes, no matter how miniscule) as "not knowing what they're talking about!"  No researcher would (especially an academic) would be so foolish!  Any truly advanced student in the subject will quickly see the huge problems concerning this book and how he type-casts the Gods (which is academically inexcusible!) 
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 Several years ago I read the Artist's Way and it changed my life. For years after that I searched for of the same but nothing was available until I came across The Artist's Way at Work.  This book of course follows the same guidelines as the first book but I feel is more suited to those who work in large offices and organizations.  I was a little disappointed as it did not really apply to my situation although I found some parts helpful in dealing with some of the people around me. Certainly for those people who work in a large company and have not read The Artist's Way this would be a good book to start you thinking in different directions 
 I was sent a pacific coast brand comforter filled with about three feathers in it.Don't waste your money you'll just end up paying extra to return it 
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 I bought the book because the reviews were good.  When I received the book and started to read, I realized I've been duped!  It's another one of those trading books with some trade examples and analyses by Elder on those trades.  Everything looks perfect after the fact.   I personally didn't get much from reading it so I returned it for refund.  This is the first book I returned a book to Amazon.  At least I now know how to return a book back to Amazon.  They paid for the return shipping 
 ...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.  But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.  One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!  I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye 
 Anyone older than that will be put off by this simplistic bit of fluff.  The author has pieced together quotes and statistics from other sources and throws them around liberally. It has the feel of a high school writing project. The advice she gives reads like something out of an article in "Seventeen Magazine".  For example, here are some of her tips for cultivating friends, Italian style:   1)Spend the time it takes to cultivate new friends. 2)Go beyond the superficial to create intimacy. 3)Practice giving and receiving affection. 4)Be willing to listen. 5)Show loyalty in your words and actions.  I bet you never would have thought of those things on your own, right?   Well, pay the $15.00 for this book and you can read 205 more pages full of equally valuable "Italian" advice.  Buy it for a teen, or better yet, save your money 
 Cannonball Adderly recorded in two styles - serious jazz and pop/soul. For the jazz listener, this CD has only two of Cannonball's best jazz tracks - Jive Samaba (a recording borrowed from Riverside Records) and 74 Miles Away. Other tracks are not as good as they could be. For example, the CD includes Work Song but Capitol itself owns a much stronger version of Work Song that first appeared on Cannonball Live - an LP apparently not converted to CD. Jazz listers interested in the Cannonball's Capitol years should try "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy - Live at The Club" which, despite the title, has a lot more real jazz.  
 Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.   Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly. 
 Said Aburish's biography of Gamal Abdel Nasser, president of Egypt 1954-1970, is an opinionated examination of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century - a man who fifty years ago captured the imagination of the Arabic-speaking people "from the Atlantic to the Gulf".  The Suez crisis of 1956 made Nasser (as he was known) an international statesman.    The author, a controversial Egyptian-Palestinian journalist based in Nice, lived through Nasser's era stationed in various Arab capitals; he witnessed the rayyes in action many times.  He was in Damascus as the Syrian masses descended on the city clamouring for Nasser to come out and speak to them; when he did, he "spoke to them slowly, in a voice of reason and intimacy that told them he loved them too."  The world was different then.    The British and French empires were shutting shop, and the US had become the new supremo of the West.  Britain and France had carved up the Arab-speaking world between them, and most Arab governments were appointed or arranged by them; oil had been discovered in the fields of Arabia and Iraq; the Suez Canal was run by Britain and France, both of whom would not entrust the vital pathway to Egypt; Algeria was just beginning to fight for long, bloody independence from France.     In Egypt, the pashas, who were less than 2 percent of the population, owned more than 65 percent of the land and exploited millions of peasants who tenanted for them.  Furthermore, a new presence had been approved by the major powers, including the USSR: Israel.  Even the pro-West Arab governments of the day couldn't stomach this new, imposed entity, and they fought its founding, but lost.  It was at this time that a young army officer from an ordinary Egyptian background appeared.  Aburish portrays him somewhat sketchily as a brooding, serious man, an avid reader who also enjoyed playing chess, and a practical man who nevertheless placed honour and dignity first.  At first, this untested leader spoke for Egyptians, but soon he directed his rhetoric to all the Arabs.  By 1958 he had become the Arab people's undisputed leader, and various governments, including local Arab ones, resented him for it.    What did he want and why?  What happened?  How did he fare?  How did he respond to new events and ideas?  What is his legacy?  Those are the kind of questions that any biography attempts to answer.  In that respect, Said Aburish does a fair job.    Nasser possessed an almost hypnotic ability to inspire his audience and gain its trust, but Aburish says he was beholden to his people's love, unable to tell them what he really thought.  In terms of Nasser's capacity to cope with and manage the heavy dose of politicking that occurs in the Middle East, Aburish shows him certainly rising to its demands - and losing his self-control at times, but underestimating the regressive, conservative instinct of the Arab people.    In Egypt, he ruled dictator-like even when he would have won any democratic elections easily.  He discarded many opinions of the ruling circle in Egypt when he might have been better served to share his decision-making with them, and he entrusted responsibility to only those he knew to be loyal when he also knew how incompetent and corrupt they were.  In pan-Arab affairs, Aburish portrays him as making policy on the hoof; he got himself involved in Algeria, in Yemen, and elsewhere when he knew that Egypt's economy was weak, and that outside forces were conspiring against him (the USA, the USSR, Israel, and Saudi Arabia).    In private, Nasser smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and regularly worked very long hours; throughout the sixties he was not well because of diabetes and heart disease, yet he pressed on - and died at 52.  Said Aburish's biography fails in many respects; it does not possess a timeline of events; there is no map of the region; and the key characters are not introduced beforehand.  There are a few punctuation mistakes, and the text does not read well; it needed a good editor.    Aburish has his issues with Islamist movements and does himself no favours by letting us know that, and not explaining himself.  Indeed, Aburish fails to offer reasons why Nasser himself was never enamoured with political Islam.    Overall, the biography assumes the reader is familiar with events and launches into opinion too quickly.  The author does not balance well between his two responsibilities as biographer:  to narrate the various strands of story and to offer insight and opinion.  There are too many flaws in this biography; it needs a major revision. 
 I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling "1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 This is the work of a filing clerk and a minor commentator on the ideas of others. Science reveals the 'actuality' and the real effects of external forces and processes every day, and the notion that we can have no perceptual grasp of these other than that provided by linguistic representation is just plain wrong. Dr. Johnson kicked a table in disgust at Berkely's Idealist drivel, to which Rorty is the heir, and it would be nice to hear a lot more tables being kicked across the Western world. In this collection Rorty tackles the ideas of sophisticated European philosphers with all the finesse and subtelty of the Incredible Hulk. This position is becoming rapidly obsolete, so let's not become members of Rorty's 'community of ironic geniuses' and move on 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 Phosphorus is the fifteenth element.Aluminum is the 13th element 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures.  it might have been a bit tedious and boring.   The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.   there are two alternatives:  - if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!!  - if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !! 
 The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review 
 Yep, I noticed the illustration of Queen Elizabeth on the cover too. Whew, a bad beginning for a not-very-helpful book. It's padded with lists of words that probably would not be used in a work of fiction (the reader would not know the meaning of words like "gworb" or "streen", so why include them?)If she wanted to include word lists - how about lists of personal names that were common in the Middle Ages? And how about a discussion of the emergence of surnames in the Middle Ages? That would have been helpful. She discusses forms of address from peasants to nobles but doesn't broach the subject of how nobles addressed each other, or how peasants addressed their fellow peasants. I think what would really make the book useful would have been a detailed diagram of a castle, illustrations of clothing, armor, mail, etc. that were actually produced in that time period, information about the plagues of the time period, the symptoms, etc. This book is lacking so much that would be really and truly useful that I have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned that the bibliography is probably the best part of the book 
 If you must use this book for class, save yourself a lot of headache and get Emanuel's Outline or flashcards on the subject or Gilbert's Outline.  This book is very difficult reading compared to my other other law books.  Law professors should really stay away from it 
 Although some of the content is interesting, if feels like it lacks organization and structure. In addition, half the book is a shader reference which seems to almost be ripped from the Microsoft DirectX documentatio 
 Ok, let me say one thing first: I have yet to finish the novel.  I don't know that I will.  So can I really write a fair, balanced review? No.  But I couldn't keep reading without saying a few things about the book.  First off, someone should have edited this book.  I've yet to encounter the typos mentioned in other reviews, but the author tends to drone on and on about things I couldn't care less about.  Second, where in the world are these people from?  The actions of the two main characters are so superficial and staged that it made me lose interest almost immediately.  Scott even thinks to himself several times that he doesn't like Ryan, but continues to hang out with him because he's so cute.  Next thing you know, he's playing his flute for him in a completely ridiculous scene that had me groaning out loud.  And the camping trip....I mean, come on.  Let us in on a real story, with believable actions, not where the two characters seem to be merely drifting through a string of set pieces that don't make sense.  Third...ah heck, I'm not even going to get started on the corny dialogue.  Let's just say I hate that I spent money on something and I can't bring myself to get through it.  But sheesh.  I compare this to Common Sons a little, where the characters sometimes behaved and said things that didn't seem real.  The only difference is, with Common Sons, the two main characters were at least interesting enough to care about.  They held that novel together even during its hard to swallow parts.  This one simply falls apart page after page.  
 The editing portion of the software is completly separate from the CD portion of the software and does not store in the same file. CD's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500. I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program. The box and program info did not indicate that. I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere 
 The original album- 8 songs- is a five star album.  I can listen to it straight through without any problem.  I also don't mind the remastered edition that came out a few years ago that expanded this to 15 tracks.  It has most of the same bsides/bonus tracks found here- but you can get it for half the price of this.  So what do you get for the extra $15 here?  12 remixes.  Big deal.  I don't need to hear 4 versions of Shout in one sitting.  Do yourself a favor and get the single disc of this for half the price, OR get Chonicles instead: It has the same 15 track remastered and expanded version of this album PLUS you get the expanded and remastered Hurting and Sowing the Seeds of Love CDS- 26 other (great) songs instead of 12 (boring) remixes.  That's 3 expanded remastered CDs for the same price as this bloated mess 
 Choice of words, writing style and teaching of biology is NOT satisfactory in this book.  Not a good way to learn CELL bio, maybe functional at higher levels but definitely not useful in explaining new concepts.  Occassionally the sentences do not even seem properly formed. i.e. fragments and more often ultra-run on sentences with no structure and no clarity.  Frustration - the emotion experienced while reading this book.   
 Worked well five times. Then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean, as per instructions. Then it would run before cutting, but upon trying to edge trim my moustache, it would stop immediately, as if a single hair could jam it. Removing head, as required for cleaning, showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine, with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade. It appears that this plastic part's stability, shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement. A poor design that shouldn't have used plastic. Do not bu 
 This vacuum looks great and promises a lot.  But it doesn't deliver.  The unit is heavy, stiff, and awkward to move around---this applies especially to the wand.  The powerhead is too big, making it hard to maneuver into smaller places.  The dust cup is rather complicated to detach and empty.  WORST OF ALL IS THE SUCTION---there is very little suction (unless my unit was defective; a possibility, considering how crappy the suction was). I often had to pass over the same crumb multiple times to get the thing picked up.  I was so unhappy with this vacuum that I practically gave it away 
 After reading the two reviews, I thought this would be a great introduction to furniture design.  I was expecting information such as generally accepted proportions of furniture elements, possibly a discussion of the application of the golden rectangle, and other non-obvious thoughts.  The information is very high-level and broad. This book is so light on real information that I consider it useless 
 I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it.  Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book.  Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his.  There is little additional value added here.  If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real 
 I have read about a dozen real estate and landlording books so far. Based on the title of this one, I expected some heavy hitting information about Property Management and Landlording. Instead, what I got was a general overview of all of the topics in the table of contents, but no really good in depth material about any of it.   I also didn't like the fact that the first several chapters are about how to decide if you're cut out for this business. I was under the impression that anyone buying a book with this title would already own a property or at least be well under way.  Overall, this is a good SUPER newbie book, but if you've read even one other, don't bother 
 I paid extra for Air Next Day service.  Item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately.  Item eventually arrived two weeks later.  I had left for a trip.  Item was eventually sent back to merchant.  Merchant didn't credit me for item returned.  I had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited.  I won't buy from Willoughby's again 
 This books is a load of nonsense. A prime example of pop spirituality.   There are things in this book that are factually WRONG!!   This nonsense is to philosophy and spirituality what a fastfood hamburger is to cuisine.... you know what? That comparison is unfair. This book is far worse to the spiritual well being of a person than hamburgers are to the physical. 
 These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.   I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved. How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  : 
 IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR LEASE THIS IS THE CD TO PLAY LOUD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES MUSIC GO ELSEWHERE. I DON'T MIND NOISE-ROCK WHEN THEIR IS A SEMBLENCE OF RIFF OR MELODY{SONIC YOUTH, BIG BLACK, DON CABALLERO}, BUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF PLASTIC. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER FROM THESE MUSICIANS 
 These boots look very nice, but unfortunately, it is way too narrow (and I have narrow feet).  My whole foot felt squashed.  Back to Amazon it goes 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead. 
 I came across a copy of Maeterlinck's "Blue Bird" some years ago and bought it because the author was an early recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.  I finally read it yesterday and I was seriously disappointed in Maeterlinck and the Nobel Prize committee of his era.  This play defies any sort of realistic audience group.  It is too simplistic in message for an adult-level fantasy and too bizarre in format for children to appreciate.  The characters are people, animals, food, emotions, plants, time, day and night, and a few other "entities" that escape my bewildered mind.  The story is simplistic and tells of two children who go on a journey to find a blue bird in order to save a fairy's daughter.  They use a magical diamond to recreate things into mammalian life forms in order that they may communicate with the boy and girl.  Many "entities" express their displeasure over human tratment while others "bring to life" emotions.  The children meet their departed relatives because all live so long as we think of them.  That's actually not a bad way of looking at things and, if that was as far into fantasy as the play went, I could see a lot of possibilities.  However, discussions with the "Luxury of Running Barefoot on Dewy Grass" left me reeling in disbelief.  The ending reminded me somewhat of "The Wizard of Oz" and I challenged myself to ask what my impression of that book would have been had I not already been familiar with its' outstanding movie version.  I tossed that thought aside quickly because "The Blue Bird" doesn't merit such a comparison.  You can see for yourself without investing too much time.  It's probably the shortest 6 act play I ever read.  I looked up the Nobel Prize rationale for Maeterlinck.  It says, in part, "in appreciation for his many-sided literary activities, and especially of his dramatic works, which are distinguished by a wealth of imagination and by a poetic fancy, which reveals, sometimes in the guise of a fairy tale, a deep inspiration, while in a mysterious way they appeal to the reader's own feelings and stimulate their immagination."  I guess.  I have to admit that I was not stimulated in the least.  In reflection, the book and the award preceeded Europe's first serious attempt to destroy itself in the guise of WWI.  The resulting pessimism may have made it impossible to return to the optimism of those halcyon days.  After reading "The Blue Bird", I'm not sure that was such a great loss, literarily speaking 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 I think the other reviewers don't understand the rating system - 1 star bad, 5 stars good.  Although there is some useful information in this book, overall it is full of errors, poorly organized, and doesn't provide much more than the manual considering the number of pages and the price ($20 list).  Here are a few problems:  - Black and white photos - that alone should tell you how much faith the publishers have in the book. They didn't want to invest a lot in it knowing how bad it was.  - Following the White Balance topic is White Balance Bracketing. The latter includes the steps for setting White Balancing but NOT Bracketing.  - In the chapter Quick Start-up guide he gives a couple of paragraphs on each of the Vari-Program modes. But the next chapter on Detail he goes right into White Balancing without mentioning which mode you can use. This is common through out the book.  - He constantly refers to the menu options by name. Why didn't they include the icons for designating the menu options as they do refering to non-menu items?  - Speaking of icons and errors, the icon is wrong on page 119 for selecting the histogram.  - He tried to fill pages with information that was already in the manual such as several pages on how to install the battery and the memory card.   - There are plenty of typos like you instead of your, repeated words, missing spaces, much, much more.  - page 90 shows a list of how many pictures can be in the buffer.  On the left under quality it shows JPEG Large which should be Fine.   With the number of errors in the book I question the accuracy of the information and suggestions by the author. The topics are not organized well enough to be used as a reference. It's almost as if he sat and rambled into a recorder and gave it off to someone to type up. Not much thought was put into how the information was presented.  What I was really hoping for and what is drastically missing is how the different features could be used to affect the photos. Examples (which would have to be in color) of the same scene with different settings. What settings to use in different situations, etc. There are a lot of features in this camera but putting them to use can be overwhelming.   I gave it 2 stars as I did get a little out of it but I had to wade through a lot to find it.  
 I can look at pictures anytime.  There is no "how to" design information nor how you can alter or rearrange your own bathrooms.  The average American home is practical and utilitarian...not high priced, hard-to-find items. 
 I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to.  I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things.  I turned it off after that.  Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon.  Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old 
 This book is the last straw for me.  I'm an ardent fan of JG's since the Clayborne brides.  Heartbreaker and Mercy were quite good and I expected better stuff from then on.  Instead, we get the same predictable setting and prototype characters.  She seems to want to write a book of all the Buchanan brothers.  Very,very disappointing thus far.  Murder List was excruciating and when I thought that things couldn't get worse, she comes up with Slow Burn.  I'd wish she'd just write Noah Clayborne's book and be done with the whole series.  Hopefully, she'd write a great book for Noah Clayborne 
 ...SI's first album was sheer beginners' luck ? It made me wonder. Whilst I found Dicknity somewhat charming,and mildly entertaining (i'd give it 3 out of 5 stars), their new effort lacks all that I hoped it to be. After many listening sessions, I still don't connect with it and, quite frankly, find myself skipping all the songs a few seconds after they begin 
 The jacket copy on this book claims that it covers events "spanning two thousand years... beginning with the rise of... Oc Eo, to the glory of the Cambodian Empire in the first millennium..." This is true to the extent that all years up to 1511 are covered in the first 30 pages, and the next twenty pages take us up to 1860. For coverage of early Southeast Asian history, I recommend the Lonely Planet guides as much more detailed, and more useful once you're there. (On the causes of the fall of the empire at Angkor, Osborne says "No single, overriding cause for this event can be identified, nor would it be sensible to try and find one." My Lonely Planet guide discussed the patterns of overbuilding, mentioned the deliterious effect of the corveé, and talked about issues with water supply, at least.) If your interest is in Southeast Asia since the French came, then this is a fairly absorbing and well-written book 
 An embarassingly bad book, unleavened by its unintentional humour. Rushkoffs silly solipsism conflates online and rave cultures into one big happy, zappy, zeitgeist -- which is simplistic to say the least. What¹s  worse, he wraps his first person report on technolibertarians and  neo-shamans in a retro-psychedelic bow, adding what sounds to me like an  uncritical endorsement of drug use. Avoid this book like the plague 
 Daniel Martin is in love with his vision of the world but in all honesty he is so self-absorbed that all of these experiences seem trivial and removed.And the female characters are like soulless machines,used for pleasure and then written off.I was waiting for a smartass kid to come along and make fun of Daniel Martin's brazen attitude or at least his shoes 
 In today's time, words are not enough to describe a sleight. Reading this book is not very easy. I would appreciate more pictures, more details . Many pictures in the book are completly useless and should be replaced by detailed photos. Sorry, I don't like it 
 I saw Making the Band occasionally and thought the ladies were talented enough and hard-working. However, while their songs on the album aren't terrible they are nothing fantastic either (although I should state that this sound of music is not my favorite anyway).  Each lady would probably rather be a "solo" artist and are doing this to get their foot in the door. While they sound decent together, they are no En Vogue and none of their voices really jump out at me solo either (Aundrea is the closest). The tracks seem to run together and sound a lot alike, simultaneously too repetitive while not saying very much.  I don't feel any of this is coming from their "heart" as it might with a solo artist; everything is contrived.  Their image is also hussied-up more than I would like for young ladies--let's focus on the talent first--vocal, lyrical and dancing ability--or maybe the talent isn't really there (?).  It's unfortunate that "sexy" today for women often equates to big hair, short shorts, boots, booty-shaking and breathy singing but some of the bigger female singing stars sell albums without blatantly resorting to that--Kelly Clarkson and Sheryl Crow come to mind. 
 Every once in a while I go out and buy another strategy book to flip through, and honestly, I am generally disappointed in what is out there. This book however ranks among the worst. The first sign is the blatant grammatical and spelling errors starting in Chapter 1 (i.e. "...then we are run like hell out of the trade."). The second warning bell comes with the gross misrepresentations about the market in general (i.e. "...low-price stocks translates into a higher-risk premium and, as a category, these low-priced stocks tends to do well..." - again, the author's grammar, verbatim). Sometimes the poor grammar can be chalked up to someone who is so into their game that they skipped less important classes when they were young (i.e. grammar, spelling, literature), and market hype can be the result of true passion, albeit a wee bit overzealous. Unfortunately, the reader quickly discovers the actual content is not very useful either, and is just a re-hashing of weak systems containing catchy buzz words and simplistic formulas 
 Before I picked up this book I knew that it was written by a ghost writer, posthumously. But since it was a "sequel" I wanted to get it anyway. What a waste of time! It is obvious that Harold Robbins had jotted down some notes and ideas and someone with no talent whatsoever had tried to make it into a novel. It is fairly clear to distinguish some of the passages that are Robbins' and then there are those that he would be ashamed to even look at. There is actually a part where the same sentence is repeated, with two words changed, on the next page. The intensity of characters, the eroticism, the storytelling that are so evident in most of Robbins' work is nowhere to be found in The Secret 
 We finally bought these Barbie Magic of the Rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired. At first, they were very excited to play with them. Positives: The doll is durable. It encourages participants to follow instructions. Negatives: I notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the DVD "hears" the instructions.   Positives: The DVD provides clear and easy to understand directions, so your doll can be programmed with your remote control. Negatives: The doll set off our fire alarm a few times before we figured out it was the doll (and we did check to see if there really was a fire!) When the DVD is not in, the dolls control the volume on the TV! This can be very annoying when the volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started playing with the dolls. My suggestion: de-program the doll when your kids are finished playing the DVD! Or, just keep it deprogrammed and use your remote -taking all control away from your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the TV 
 As a single 30-something man, I bought this book out of a sense of curiosity.   Popular culture scolds men when we become too demanding. A man who will only look at women who are ten years younger, rail-thin, and blonde is quickly dismissed as superficial. However, the women that Ms. Whitehead describes are only interested in tall, handsome, alpha males who make $100,000 per year. And they want to land them at age 35.   I am 35 myself, and I would love to meet a Britney Spears lookalike who is intelligent, makes lots of money, and (very important) is also interested in me. I would also like to win the lottery, have as much hair as I had when I was twenty, and go golfing five days per week. But that's not life on earth.   Perhaps Ms. Whitehead could write a sequel: "There are Plenty of Good Men Left, but You're too Vain to Notice Them."  Most 30ish single men I know have long since realized that no woman "has it all"--and if she does, she's probably married. I suggest that Ms. Whitehead's women take a reality check, lighten up, and go talk to the short bald guy who is smiling at them from the other side of the room. 
 This dialogue was PAINFUL to read.  My 9 year-old Goddaughter can write better dialogue in her stories that this stuff!  Luckily, I only paid 75 cents for the book at a clearance book sale.  Save your money.  Turns out this book wasn't even worth the 75 cents I paid for it!  
 Good concept, title, and cover... but lacking good pictures. Any most pictures are very small. Lots of good writing, though 
 I would agree that this book (and the others like it by Hirsch) offer a basis for valuable information. However, I would warn you to supplement a literacy curriculum with other stories and authors that include cultures other than European American. Look closely at the contents and you will notice that his view of "American literate culture" is overwhelmingly European-American based. I agree that students need to learn "American literate culture," however, curriculum needs to represent the many people that make up our diverse nation.  5th Grade Teache 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 Now when I say boring I don't mean it isn't realistic I have no doubt that women do talk this much about sex when there alone but since they all seem so unlikable (with the exception of Olivia D'Abo who plays the lover of one of the women who reunite in this film), I didn't care about what happen to them. Matter of fact, I would be so happy if something bad happen 
 Received this as a gift a year ago.  Pulled it out of the box set it up with a stew and when I got home...  Well, the stew was all over the cabinet.  Upon  further review, I found two hair like cracks in the pot itself.  Was unable to get it warenteed and couldn't even find a replacement crock.  Have been a crock pot user for decades,but won't buy one of these 
 I know others have found this a good resource but I found it very dry and tedious to read.  I returned the book 
 Caputo has written much on Derrida's approach to religion and if your familiar with this attitude also associated with Levinas, usually dubbed as post-secularism, then you know what to expect.  I enjoyed some of the insights within this book, but Zizek's On Belief from the same series surpasses this work on many accounts.  Pass this one up in favor his.  It's much more relevant and intellectually challenging 
 i had to read this book in school.  it's horrible.  it's annoying.  There is no point to the story.  It isn't even fun to read.  I would keep reading, expecting something great to happen, but nothing ever happened.  i skimmed the last 25 pages--it was that boring.  there are quite a few typos in it as well.  everything about it is pure cliche.  the first few pages are good, then it stops.  it's like, mcdermott had imagination when she began writing it, then she went braindead.  i would not recommend it to anyone 
 This is not a book for "newbies." If your family is f*cked up, you'll do better with information that is more basic to supporting your getting OUT, rather than how to survive being in it.. 
 This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: "Lisa de los ojos azules". I wouldn't buy this CD without that song 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 I guess studio time must be very expensive, cause Denise Austin rushes through the exercises like the set is on fire.  Maybe if she had cut down the intro, there would have been more time for exercising.  It seems a little disjointed with the constant change from floor to standing exercises.  Before you can get to the floor, the exercisers are on rep 2 or 3.  Then it's back up again.    There's a lot of talking going on, with exhortions to "sqeeze, sqeeze, sqeeze!"  Perky is an understatement.    
 I sympathise with the theme of this novel and I really wanted to like it. The ugly face on neo liberalism should be exposed more often.   Unfortunately, the exploration of the idea is studded with cliches and the  writing is often too self consciously cute for comfort - Billy Bragg songs  cover the same territory with far greater ease 
 Reference picture quality on HD-DVD.  Basically unwatchable though.  I would not recommend the blind buy on this one.  
 Steven Spielberg's classic masterpiece JAWS did not have a stellar plot.  It was a bubblegum storyline: a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast.  In the hands of any other director, it would have been a terrible film, something to laugh at on lonely Saturday nights while chowing down popcorn.  In the hands of Mr. Spielberg, however, it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made.    Steven Spielberg's hands were nowhere near JAWS: THE REVENGE.  Okay, so here's the plot.  Remember JAWS 3-D?  Well, that never happened.  Chief Brody - from the first movie - is dead.  His wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), is living a happy life in Amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark.  Ellen flies down to the Bahamas with her other son, Michael Brody (Lance Guest).  Though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy, Ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes, the one that Chief Brody killed - is back for revenge, hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one.  Even though it died.  In the first movie.    Confused?  Any sensible moviegoer would be.  It's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third JAWS sequel.  As you now know, the story is completely absurd.  The script, by Michael De Guzman, is unintentionally hilarious, filled with outrageously funny dialogue.  For example, in one scene, pilot Hoagie (played by Michael Caine!) is courting Ellen Brody.  HOAGIE: I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody. ELLEN: Why? HOAGIE: Because ... it would not occur to you why.  And if that's not confusing enough for you, feast upon this nugget of dialogue, from a conversation between Michael and Ellen Brody.  ELLEN: Why did you come out here?  Why did you come out here? MICHAEL: Mom!  Mom!  WHY did you take the boat? ELLEN: It [the shark] kept coming! MICHAEL: Don't you realize what you're doing? ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, there was nothing else to do! MICHAEL: Mom, you shouldn't have done it. ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, I've tried!  Joseph Sargent's directing is terrible; it's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing.  Which may be why the acting is so horrible.  The highlight of the cast is Lance Guest, whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented Michael Caine's by a longshot.  The horrid acting is forgivable, however; after all, how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd?  A film in which sharks roar, swim from New England to the Bahamas to kill family members, and leap thirty feet out of the water?  On the plus side, JAWS: THE REVENGE is enormously fun to watch, thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity.  It is very likely one of the worst films ever made - JAWS 3-D looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there's nothing else on TV some late night, grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is JAWS: THE REVENGE 
 The first chapter is about the Gaines family, how is it Mr. Weisenburger can make so many mistakes and no one seems to notice. Did he use newspaper articles of the day for his chapters having to do with the trial? If he can take a 12 page letter from Sept. 14, 1852 and change the names of those in the letter how can we believe he could get the rest of the story right ? The Gaines family genealogy chart is wrong and possibly gotten off any one of the internet genealogy websites.  He constantly refers to a "teenage or young" Archibald, this Archibald was 25 years old ! And this Archibald was the oldest child of John Pollard Gaines.  He gets the dates wrong to so many things you have to wonder what else is wrong ? This book may have been more accurate if the author had consulted with descendants of the Gaines, Bedinger or Marshall families, which he did not. Mr. Weisenburger's bio at the University of Kentucky states "Steven is a fanatical researcher of primary sources." With so many errors, I do not see that.. 
 The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful.    After that, the format became a bit tired.  The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over.  It just became boring after a while.  Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy.  From there, proceed with caution 
 I compulsively buy every top-down sweater book I can find.  I was hoping this would be a good addition to my collection, but there is very little benefit to be gained by owning this book.  First, what I liked about the book: the section on necklines and collars was good.  I get tired of the old crew neck sweater, and this book has given me the idea to try a polo neck.  Some of the sweaters are pretty and I think they can be used as inspiration.  What I didn't like: everything else.  The author claims her way of starting at the collar and avoiding any shaping of the neck is revolutionary.  It's not.  It's simplistic and makes a garment lie funny.  Putting more stitches on the front than on the back couldn't possibly make up for no neck shaping.  I myself do not mind going back and picking up stitches around the neck to make the collar.  It gives a more polished look.  You can tell by looking at the photographs that some of the models have the front of the sweater riding up on their necks.  I want to tug down the front of my own sweater just looking at them!  The sweaters with wider, deeper necklines look OK without any shaping.  And the armpits on the sweaters are very deep.  One reason for making top-down sweaters is so that you can try it on as you go.  If you're already at the underam and you still don't have the required number of stitches, don't keep knitting!  Just cast on the extra stitches at the underarms.        I wouldn't waste my money on this book.  There are only a few sweaters that are attractive enough to even use as inspiration, and the design information given leaves a lot to be desired 
 What does an unsuccessful draft of a fine author's work look like?  If that question interests you, read Summer Crossing.  If the question doesn't, you can skip this novel.  I doubt if this book would have been published except that the story contains bits and pieces of themes that are powerfully developed in Breakfast at Tiffany's, also by Mr. Capote.   When Truman Capote found his writing voice, it was in writing about his own life and the people he knew.   Summer Crossing comes across, by comparison, as a writing exercise disconnected from his personal experience that has serious problems in its conception and implementation.  So what's the story?  A rich young New York socialite, Grady McNeil, is left inexplicably behind and unchaperoned for the summer while her parents shop their way through Europe.  In the best tradition of young people first on their own, Grady soon finds a way to break all the bounds of her former life.  She craves the reality of this new life . . . but finds it brings complications she hadn't really expected.  With that set up, one would expect a fine short story . . . but Mr. Capote didn't yet have the skill to turn the premise into a novel.  Later, he would.  Should the book have been salvaged and made available?  I think so.   Should you read it?  Probably not 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Losing a court case is like suffering a poker "bad beat."  Nobody really wants to hear your story, and it's considered "whining" if you don't get over it after one beer.  Amazingly, losers comprise more than 50% of all lawsuit participants.  Most go away muttering under their breath about judges who don't understand them.  Some can't get over their legal "bad beat" and write books about their loss.  So say it, so be it.  The Discovery Institute has published their whine after the Dover bad beat.  Entitled "Traipsing Into Evolution,"  it appeals to the court of public opinion.  Appeal denied.  This is a wretched book.  The Discovery Institute PR campaign for Intelligent Design bears a laughably strong resemblance to Baghdad Bob, the Iraqui "Information" minister who claimed there weree no Americans in Iraq's capital city as those same Americans pounded up the stairs into his own studio.  His mere statements of fact served as their own proof, no matter how outlandish.  Traipsing continues this M. O.  None of the factual assertions in this book are to be taken seriously.   The book overlooks a peculiar idiosyncrasy of courts.  Unlike Iraq's ministry of Information, courts rely on something called "evidence."  There are two components to that concept.  First, only evidence actually admitted in court "counts." Out of court self serving press releases are not evidence and don't count.  Second, the evidence proffered in court must meet certain minimum requirements.  Witness testimony, for example, must be both under oath and subject to cross-examination.   That means witnesses must answer questions from an attorney who is not sympathetic to the witness's own position.  The witness  cannot decline to answer and the witness must tell the truth.  In the Dover trial, the Intelligent Design side offered: (1) out of court press releases; (2) proffered witnesses who waffled, equivocated, and finally admitted the lack of factual support for ID when cross examined; and (3) some of the Intelligent Design witnesses got caught lying under oath.   The trial judge's opinion detailed ID's lack of evidence and the witness testimonial defects, including the falsehoods, throughout his 139 page decision.  Any intellectually honest post-mortem would have addressed these issues head on.  If you expect Traipsing to do so, you'll be disappointed.  Traipsing argues that ID is good science and that it is not creationism. In "Bhagdad Bob" fashion, the book offers Discovery Institute press releases as "evidence" in support The court rejected both propositions based on the evidence actually offered at trial.  As just one example, two Discovery Fellows, Michael Behe and Scott Minnich testified as experts.  Both were asked under oath if ID was science.  Both had the choice to answer truthfully or to lie and prevaricate.  To their credit, they answered truthfully.  Minnich testified that ID was not science and Behe testified it was as scientific as astrology.  Based on this evidence from ID's own proponents, the judge not surprisingly found that ID was not science.  Frankly, the authors distort both the in-court and out of court evidence in their book.   The book makes much of the fact that the judge found a lack of peer reviewed literature and ignored the "vast" ID favorable literature enclosed in the book as Appendix B.  There are two reasons why the judge did not consider this literature.  (1) it was out of court hearsay, not subject to cross examination; and (2) It is not scientific research, it is essentially propaganda. This second point is why nobody was willing to actually testify in court that such peer reviewed ID-specific scientific research existed.    If you are interested in what really happened, get it from the horse's mouth.  Read the opinion itself and the actual evidence and trial testimony.  Both are online. 
 I'm sure the mat would have been fine, but they mixed up my order, and this company does not refund shipping, which was almost the price of the mat-- lame 
 The author is reusing a similar plot device than in "Twisted":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes. The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.  A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:  ("favilla", "favillitos"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional. In sum, a book carelessly executed 
 Sandra Betzina is wonderfully talented when it comes to garment contstruction.  I have several of her books and love them.  However, her expertise and creativity do not seem to extend to home sewing. The projects in this book are not inspiring. The fabric choices are questionable.  It is difficult to glean the 'tricks of the trade' as this book is organized entirely by project, not technique.  Save your money.  If you are truly interested, check it out from the library before you invest in this publication 
 after few months of using it, it started to lag badly, and the scroll wheel stopped working, I'll never buy logitech mouse again. 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very "hard" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.  Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.  I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive 
 I had high hopes for this novel after reading the other Amazon reviews.  To my displeasure, I found the novel wanting.  It was lacking in suspense; both in plot and in character development.  The main character 'aged' 20+ years throughout the course of the novel, but his outlook remained stagnant. Some readers/reviewers might consider his laconic and meandering personality to be refreshing, charmingly hard-boiled or amusing. I found it to be boring.  I will give the novelist credit for his skillful depiction of an archetypal Kansas 'boom' town.  But, disappointingly, there is little else to recommend 
 This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Mr. Leddick is neither  a scholar nor a very good story teller.  His work is poorly documented, and  provides little social context for the subjects' milieu.  I was also  disappointed in the book's failure to convey any historical context as the  bits and pieces of the subjects' lives were scantilly discussed.  Although  he succeeds in giving the reader a rough synopsis of the lives of Lynes,  Cadmus and Kirstein (at least covering the period of time that Lynes was  alive), he conveys little understanding of the artistic contributions of  each or how these men or their artistic contributions were interconnected.   The book makes it seem that the three were only "intimate  companions" through a loosely defined group of cocktail party  habitués, hardly a basis for a meaningful "triography".  One  wonders why Leddick chose these three as worthy of a joint writing.  It  appears that a biography of each would have included little material about  the others.  I would have thought a "triography" of George Platt  Lynes, Monroe Wheeler and Glenway Westcott, who lived in a ménage à trois  of sorts, would have made far more interesting reading, as would a  "triography" of Paul Cadmus, and Jared and Margaret French.   Instead, the reader comes away from "Intimate Companions" starved  to read a well-documented exposé of each of these men's lives and artistic  contributions 
 I read this book for a graduate studies class.  The critical padagogy Freire gives is excellent and we had deep discussions in class.  The reading is challenging because some points are repeated and one wonders whether one is making any headway at times.  The ideas re education are basic to understanding current educational trends 
 In fourth grade we were read this book by our teacher, after lunch (!) for about 2 weeks. I really think this had everything to do with my now phobia of worms, which sounds stupid and a little crazy but believe me not a mild problem when it rains. Thanks, Thomas Rockwell and Miss Maroon, the nightmares continue!  (I gave it one star reluctantly because the review wouldn't post with no stars selected) 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed 
 Though I was lead to believe this was an excellent novel, I was disappointed in the explicitly Chicana perspective that never rises above its roots to much of anything universal or enduring. The "service" theme is clever and the book can be endearing, even poetic at times, but overall, it's not worth the time. If you must, borrow it from a friend or get it from a library 
 ...mainly because i think less of LL as a person now, not necessarily as a rapper...    what a letdown. i ordered this for 75 cents (no joke) off half.com after watching ll cool j preach his way through deep blue sea. i got it because i remembered "mama said knock you out" and "going back to cali", and i remember liking them, but jeez, man, those are the only two tracks worth listening to on this entire friggin' cd. and this is the greatest hits? most upsetting of all is that j comes off as a huge jerk...the lyrics here are even more chauvinistic and disrespectful than i would have expected from a more typical street-rapper. some of the songs are scarcely listenable the message is so embarrassing. the good news is, of course, that "knock you out" is even more badass than i remember 
 Unfortunately, this book doesn't make it any easier to understand various critial theories.  It skims over them in a way that requires the reader to already have a basic understanding of the theories, and it often explains the theories in the jargon of the theorists.  In other words, it isn't very helpful for those trying to get a handle on unwieldy theories.  It isn't a basic introduction, nor is it for "dummies."  
 My oh my...Neil Halstead, what have you been smoking? The change from Slowdive to Mojave 3 was drastic, but tolerable. I enjoyed Ask Me Tomorrow, though I'd much rather have heard another outing in the vein of Slowdive. Out of Tune, was hit or miss. The first few songs hit, the last several were definite misses that seemingly spiraled out of control and landed Mojave 3 into this heap of garbage called 'Excuses For Travelers'. Which is a horrid gathering of 12 poor 'Excuses For' songs. Listen to Neil sing out of key. Listen to him recycle riffs. This is simply a sorry attempt from a once great musician. Do not forsake the wonderfully lush atmospheres of Slowdive for this rediculas Bob Dylan incarnate

 Most films don't deserve a true one star rating. You have to consider that movies are a result of hard work and at least some technique on the parts of everyone involved, and if a film fails in that department, then it has some redeeming values because it is so bad its laughable. However, Zombie Lake is a technical failure and has no redeeming values whatsoever. This film completely trashes all of the criteria that makes up a good zombie-gore movie. The zombies are of the mint-julep facial masks vareity (like Dawn of the Dead)and the closest they get to a specially designed zombie is a torn-out eyeball. The excessive nudity that makes this film mentionable is indeed excessive, but the genetalia that you get to gawk at does not belong to very pamela andersonesque women, if you know what I mean. Gore? In this movie, the few victims of zombie wrath are bitten on the neck (with the camera right behind the zombies head the whole time, obscuring the actual bite) and then after the ghoul shambles away, the camera walks around to the victim's head with a spot of cambell's tomato soup spilled nearby. Thats it, no bite wound or anything, just some soup. It probably wasn't even real Cambell's but some government issued soup that the director lifted from the Salvation Army's food bank. The plot is unimportatant (as with all zombie movies) but it is stupid and completely lacking in logic. The overall film looks and sounds like some really old educational movie, so you expect Leonard Nemoy to start narrarating it at a drop of a hat. The only reason I gave this movie an additional credit is because die hard zombie movie collecting elitists will certainly want to possese the worst example of the species.   
 I have a few concerns with the words Willie Jolley writes and speaks.  Never quote the bible then talk about going out and doing all you can to make more money. Do you really believe Jesus condones the desire to gain "worldly" things Willie? You talked the entire time about your riches and have the nerve to quote proverbs...   I have a little tip for you Willie, when you write or speak, don't use Microsoft  / Bill Gates as examples of success. You do know that they were found guilty in a court of law numerous times of illegal practices to get where they are right? They lie, steal, and cheat to get ahead.  Will you be endorsing Martha Stewart and Enron next? Maybe use Tyco or Halliburton as an example of how to succeed and make loads of money.  I have a little tip for you too Willie, maybe a little something you can throw in your speeches or possibly your next book: Tell the people you talk to, that no matter how much money they get, that in life, happiness is what really counts. Just, do something everyday that makes you smile. You don't have to brainwash yourself by repeating affirmations of "I am happy" 800 times a day. You don't have to force yourself to be a type-a personality. You don't have to climb the corporate ladder of achievement to have a wonderful fulfilling life. No Willie, all you need is to accept you for who you are, and strive to be happy. I smile everyday. I don't have to brainwash myself to get there.  You're either the bee or the windshield? Too bad life isn't so black and white as to only be reduced to such.  I say, seek out the fields of flowers and avoid the highway altogether.  
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 Hancock makes important points in this book: many aid projects do more harm than good, many aid officials are overpaid, too much aid money gets funneled to US companies (for more on this, see Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, by John Perkins), and publicly funded aid organizations are insufficiently accountable to the public. But his extreme rhetoric warns us that if there is a good side to aid, it certainly won't be represented here. Here's a sample of his accusations: "These lords of poverty are the druids of the modern era wielding enormous power that is accountable to no one."  On the one hand, Hancock's anecdotal evidence is unconvincing. He tells us that his often-chilling anecdotes are representative, but we have no way of really knowing. That said, he provides so many anecdotes that - by the end - we start to feel like they are, if not representative of all aid, at least insightful into an uncomfortable proportion.  But the litany of anecdotes is also tiring. The writing is not particularly great, and I felt that some of the analysis was flawed. (For example, in two places he argues that Western nations don't give nearly enough in aid, but most of the book argues that everything we give is wasted anyway. It's not clear how giving more would help, given his theses.)   Eventually I tired of simply hearing one aid horror story after another. He also misses the fact that there have been some major successes in aid, particularly in the realm of public health, in which organizations like the World Bank and UNICEF have played a part. (To read about some of these successes, look at Millions Saved by Ruth Levine et al.)  I'm glad I read the book, but I wish Hancock had made it a little less exhausting and a little more balanced. I also wish we'd gotten more solutions in the end. His only solution is to dissolve the aid industry (as it is "inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform"), after which we have the vague promise that "it will become possible for people to rediscover ways to `help' one another directly." 
 I first picked up on the Anita Blake series a little over a year ago. I was absolutely enthralled. Not only was the main character witty, intelligent, and kick-butt, but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through. Who can forget Zerbrowski's antics (even in the worst of times) or the cold-hearted killing of everyone's favorite bounty hunter? After reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on Amazon, I am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are: what happened?  I just finished Narcissus in Chains. Normally when I finish a book, I'm left with a sense of fulfillment, like I've accomplished something. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I've always found this series to capture me from the get-go, but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard. Not only was the plot rather weak, but Anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over. Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, and even Asher seem to plague her thoughts. And although she will do anything to save a member of her pard, or anyone else for that matter, her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys. And did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing? Hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book. Unlike the earlier part of the series, the writing in Narcissus in Chains is less imaginative and less memorable. On top of it all, come the end of the book, we have this bad guy who I can't even remember where he came from in the first place!  My favorite part of the books has always been Anita's police work. I am honestly ten times more interested in her career than I am in her love life. I miss having a tight, intense plot that flows, instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span. And as pointed out in the book, the charming Anita Blake we used to know and love really has become a monster. A literary disaster of a monster.  Although the reviews for Cerulean Sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for Narcissus in Chains, I plan to go ahead and continue the series. I can't give up on something that has such great potential, and from the sound of it, this next one has a more recognizable plot. I can only hope. Unfortunately, I believe that Obsidian Butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
 I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed 
 I have always eagerly awaited each Clive Cussler novel and this was no exception.  The story is classic Clive Cussler and by itself is fascinating, however, the writing is boring.  To me, Clive Cussler did not write the book, his son did.  The women "gush" and the men "snarl".  It was so predictible!  I even knew who the person was who was in the boat before they were even rescued.  I suprised myself when right in the middle of the rocket launch, I didn't even care if I finished the book.  Here's hoping the writing will improve in the next book 
 I thought this was supposed to be a mystery. However, it was more like watching someone else's vacation photos or reading in depth another person's family tree. Completely mind numbingly boring. The cover and back page reviews state it "builds in tension". HA!It takes almost until the last two pages to solve what we as the reader saw coming miles away, and is so bland in it's actual revealment that who cares????? After all of that talk of Mrs so-and-so married Mr so-and so over and over and over, you just dont care anymore. Dont waste your time. This is not suspense, it's tedium 
 This is one of the stupidest books I have ever read. The main character, "Fred" the mermaid, is a mass of neuroses. She's bitchy, snide and her responses to the most simple of events is weirdly inappropriate. In the very first scene, this 30 year old ph.D stumbles across her parents having sex and completely freaks out, so much so that she violently (but oh, so amusingly...) attacks them both. Time for little Fred to grow up, I think. The mystery is too easily solved and the men in her life, both instantly, and for no apparent reason, falling in love with her, are simple stereotypes of the gorgeous but smitten male. The first in a series, It seems likely that she'll soon be having a lot of sex with both of them; and simple, brainless pornography is about the best I can hope for from this ridiculous book 
 I find it hard to believe that this my hometown that Kaufmann is writing about. Notice he doesn't even live there.  He lives in a town nearby.  It's a wonder he wasn't run out of town (maybe he was and that's why he doesn't live in Batavia).  I'm sorry but this is not an affetionate tale.  Kaufmann obviously has no love for the town.  Yes, Batavia has problems but any town or city does and we love them anyway.  It's home.  Go back to Washington, Mr. Kaufmann 
 Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing. 
 I am not a fan of the "New Avengers" series at Marvel. But I had missed the last few issues of the "Avengers" so I purchased this book to see what Mr. Bendis had done to the team prior to the "New" being inserted into the title. I was not thrilled with the way he callously killed several key characters and transformed one into a maniacal monster. This book to me is a perfect example of what is so wrong with Marvel Comics today. Shock factor and "Dissassembling" as opposed to good storytelling. I thought the best part of the book was the last segment called "Finale" wherein the remaining core Avengers gather to reflect on their past many years together.This was very well done and poignant. Beyond that, I had no great love for this book. The callous way other authors tenure on the title were thrown away with little comments like "There is no such thing as Chaos magic" is offensive to me, and shows the out with the old and in with the new mentality which Marvel reeks with these days. I really don't recommend this book. unless like myself, you just wanted to see the last few issues of the classic series.   David Finch's artwork is another matter. It is brooding and beautiful at times, but other times his renditions of certain characters is so far off, as to be unrecognizable as to who they are. Again "Finale", which featured several artists from the Avengers past was my favorite segment as the great George Perez wrapped up the book with his spectacular artwork 
 This book chronicles a few years in the childhood of a young girl named  Hattie whose mother is a severe manic depressive.  Unlike other children,  Hattie and her brother, Freddy, operate more as caretakers than as  children.  They watch their mother and act according to her state of mind  for that specific day.  Pearl, the cook and maid, acts as surrogate mother,  nurturing the siblings with care and love as they grow older, something  their mother has never been able to do.  Pearl also acts as guardian to the  mother, keeping her from leaving the house in a frenzy when she is manic  and from killing herself when she is depressed.  Although this book was  easily read in a day, it was disappointingly bland and somewhat  anti-climactic.  I can't place exactly what it was - it just didn't build  up to a page-turning "what-will-possibly-happen-next" mindset and  I grew bored and apathetic towards the end which is highly unusual for me.   I would recommend it as a good, thought-provoking, informative book on  manic depression but certainly not as entertaining fiction 
 Quite frankly, this is a piece of junk.  I'm surprised that Norelco would put its name on it.  I received it as a Christmas gift and within a week, the adjustment lock on both the beard and hair trimmer had broken so that I could no longer use either on anything but the shortest length. The trimmer itself is adequate, but not up to Wahl or other basic cutters.  The parts are mostly plastic and cheaply made.  I would not suggest this cutter to anyone. Either spend more money and get something substantial and durable, or spend the same amount on a trimmer without the frills that is better made 
 I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson.  This afterword, however, of Jerome Charyn's is almost more than I can bear.  I'll be frank.  Is this an afterword with supposed insightful information into the nuances of the story, and or the writer/period/genre, or a freakin book report.  Kids, if you're buying this book for class, get this edition and don't even bother reading the actual story if you're not interested.  Skip to the very back and you'll find all the multi-paragraph quotes you can handle, as well as rambling general encyclopaedic info on Robert Louis Stevenson.    I think I wrote an "essay" exactly like this as a freshman in highschool english class and received a C for lack of creativity and effort.  That's not exactly a compliment for you Mr. Charyn 
 After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon

 There is no such entity as an addictive personalty . Often  the author belittiles ,  mocks   and  discounts what a substance Abuser  says .  Few are truely  in denail as they are seeking help , what denial really means is that the person disagrees with the 12 step counslers version of thier life and problems .  What the non medical term Dry drunk means is a person is  not using   or moderateing with out the help of a 12 step program   The reality is most people quit or moderate on thier own with out the religiious gibberish  of a 12 step program that many    have begun to veiw as a  dangerous cult   Please   seek other advice based  on emprically   reviewed science not  ancetdotal     nonsense dreged  on out dated relgious  dogma .  12 step treatment is nothing more than faith healing and the last time "denial " was used as  evidnece    of something was during the witch craft trails in te 16,00s . It is now 2006 we can do alot better than this.   
 Ever click on somebody's crappy web page from 1995 and think "Jesus Christ, what IS that terrifying sound!"? Well, it was probably a midi ripped from this CD. I think it's safe to conclude that "The Ned Nash Orchestra" is actually some nerd messing around with a synthesizer in his garage. If you're counting on sweeping renditions of classics, this is not for you. Then again this CD is not recommended for anybody who cries easily, suffers with migraines, or values music in general 
 For an artist, increasing creativity may mean a lot of different things.  It may mean finding new ways to look at the world that can then be transformed into a work.  It may mean developing techniques that allow the artist to convert what he see into a work.  It may mean removing some psychological obstacle that is preventing the artist from looking at the world in a particular way, or transforming that vision into a work.  Or it may mean allowing oneself to get started in the entire process.  "On Becoming an Artist" seems to be aimed at this last situation.  The author, a psychologist, believes that anyone can create art if they are mindful, as she defines that term.  Being mindful appears to mean having an open mind that is continually ready to consider the world anew.  If individuals creating art are mindful, Langer says, they will, among other things, be authentic, not consider evaluation, not worry about mistakes, be free of rules, not be concerned about comparisons, and not worry about talent.  While I have not read Langer's other books about mindfulness, this goal does not seem to be just about dealing with phobias, but rather about adopting a method of living one's life akin to a kind of secular Zen Buddhism.  While it may be beneficial to practice mindfulness, I had the feeling that this book developed out of her own prior work on mindfulness and her personal experience as a painter, rather than out of a sense that she could help artists to be more creative.  What she urges is adopting art as a form of pastime for the benefit of the artist without any concern for the message or the audience.  There is nothing wrong with that, but practicing artists who are interested in extending their creativity will be interested in going beyond self-indulgence.  I also found the sub-title "Reinventing Yourself through Mindful Creativity" to be a little misleading,  It suggest that Langer will tell the individual how practicing art will make one's life fuller, but what she tells is how to practice art without certain hang-ups that may or may not be useful to the creative person.  For Langer's fans this book will probably allow them to explore the concept of mindfulness in greater depth.  There probably will not be much here to help the practicing artist to be more creative. 
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
 As I must have been to keep reading this book. Ray is a young American in Venice whose very young, very rich wife has just committed suicide.  He's not too upset, and his wife is not the focus of anything, but his rude, demanding father-in-law is upset and is the focus. His father-in-law Ed blames Ray for the suicide of his daughter. He attempts to murder an unsuspecting and trusting Ray. Ray is surprised by this, but survives and wants to track down Ed and "explain" his marriage. To a murderer.   The rest is more attempts on Ray's life and his not learning his lesson.  He finally fights back but doesn't bother to press charges against Ed when asked to.  Apparently Ray is one who "walks away" from confrontation or doing what is right for society.    
 This explores the sociopolitical causes and ramifications in the development of modern infrastructure. But due to continual stating and restating of simple points, a reader loses track of what the authors are attempting to train his attention on. With all the research the authors have done on the subject matter, you might expect that; but it could take you a year of poring over this to get the full thrust of this. It certainly isn't concise.  The books real problem is the writing style. The text is a hybrid of bureaucratic and academic writing, defensively constructed to obviate charges of ambiguity or assumption. Here's a typical sentence: "Thus we could argue that the supplementation of state forms of collectivised infrastructure development that supported the modern ideal with privatised regimes that need to attract international finance capital seems very likely to support the splintering of integrated and bundled networks into a myriad of individually financed and managed infrastructure projects."  You can go a few pages before encountering a sentence that hasn't been overworked like this. Torpid.  The other big problem is it's design. What you get out of it will depend on whether you can overcome the disruptive format. Just when you've finally bit into a passage of that writing, a new heading in boldface interrupts both the text and your concentration. This occurs once or twice a page for 400 pages. It isn't helpful. Is this a book, or is it six hundred short articles? Frequent sidebars also induce reader distraction. 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 dont waste your money mind or time. go to church, pray to your whatever. be nice.  you dont have to spend money on buying a book to get to heaven. i promise 
 "The Church" is nonsensical rubbish.  I know Dario Argento is weak on plot, but this movie is absurd.  It's interesting how Argento does such a good job with a movie like "Suspiria" creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky; but, with "The Church", the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present, and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is...the result is a disaster!!  Indeed, there is zero character development, horrendous acting, monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay, all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called "The Church".  This movie is trash...PERIOD!  STAY AWAY!!!! 
 "Honor Thy Father" is a highly santized look at the Bonanno crime family, one of the infamous "Five Families" in the New York Mafia.The principal character is the son of the Family Boss. Because the author had the cooperation of the Bonannos in writing "HTF", a reader can scarcely expect any juicy "inside the mafia" expose. And, of course, that is exactly what the reader will NOT get. The story suffers further by its' studied, almost languid pace. Ultimately, "Honor Thy Father" is a tale leading nowhere and signifying nothing. The one and only saving grace is the historical background provided on the OTHER New York area families and the intrigues, betrayals, rubouts, deportations, etc that have provided so much entertainment. I remember the unsuccesful"hit" on Frank Costello and the succesful Park Sheraton Hotel hit on Albert Anastasia (in his barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel)because, at different times,I lived near the sites. On my way to school,I daily walked past Frank Costello's apartment building at 115 Central Park West. Other than this New York Mob trivia, "Honor Thy Father" has zero to offer. And nowhere between the pages is a single "honorable" act performed. Readers should look elsewhere for tales of honor or of the Mafia 
 Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.  However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity.  Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.  
 I believe that life is too short and books that really deserve to be read too plentiful (not to mention movies worth watching, games worth playing, ...) for anyone to spend more than five minutes on this book. It's amazing how marketing can help sell such fluffy material. Any time, I recommend "If You Want to Write" by Brenda Ueland instead 
 I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting 
 I know of many people who would love to have an elk carcass for their holiday.  Birthdays, Christmas, Hanukkah, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday Observed, Grandparent's Day, etc. are all holidays where a big piece of elk meat could brighten someone's day.  But watch out!!! I have often used Amazon in order to buy gifts, and with this elk carcass GIFT WRAPPING IS NOT AN OPTION.  I would think that half the fun of giving a huge elk carcass would be watching the look on your loved one's face as he or she unwrapped the slab of meat.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not think this is so.  With the weight of the product, I think it is going to be difficult to wrap this on my own.  Sorry Uncle Tino, no elk carcass for Columbus Day this year!  
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 This CD for me was a waste of money. Its just not what i thought it would be. Others may enjoy it but for me..it wasnt what i was hoping to hear 
 I really thought this necklace looked good in the picture, and then I recieved it today wow! it is so light and the quality of the chain is terrible.  I have bought this for my boy friend for Christmas and now im wondering whether to even give it to him.  It should cost 20 bucks maybe.        
 I'm a long time fan of Iris Johansen's books, but I found On The Run very disappointing. The character and relationship development was weak when compared to her many other excellent books. The plot had potential, but tended to drag on. It didn't help that I found obvious holes in the plot.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone knowledgeable about horses. There were glaring errors in details specific to horses that I found very distracting. I usually find horse-related errors in fiction, but some of these errors were fundamental to the plot so key story elements became too unrealistic for the plot to be successful for me ... even as fiction.   With better research and attention to detail regarding the horses, the plot that focused so much on horses could have been adjusted to work well. Non-horsemen wouldn't be aware of the errors and perhaps they would enjoy this book. Many other Johansen books have been keepers for me to re-read, but not this book.  
 This book is not well written and seemed like the sections were not in order.  Morningstar's book on stock investing is the best...buy that one 
 I purchased this item for my 2 year old.  The book won't stay on the Leap Pad.  It constantly said misread the cartridges.  After he seemed frustrated, I tried it myself and could not get the thing to work correctly.  I have come to expect better from Leap Pad products and I was very disappointed 
 This book is silly junk.  I find few redeeming qualities in it.  The events contain magic without making sense, and the story line leads to no relevation and a stupid conclusion.  It is a waste of money 
 I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.  Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.    Just lists.  Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.  Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back 
 Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock 
 It seems like this book just copied information from earlier books on the subject and rushed to capitalize on the increase of AS diagnoses. Atwood's book is far more interesting, informative and original. I've seen this woman speak as well, and she seems a bit unclear 
 I just finished reading this book and I must not get this genre of writing. Unlike many of the reviews here, I found the book a disappointment.  I thought the characters were one dimensional, underdeveloped and unrealistic. As a black woman, I found Fiona's character especially annoying.  I don't care how much I want a job or wanted to help a friend, I would not practically prostitute myself to get it. If she really wanted people to respect her for her brains, why did she spend most of the book dressed like a video hootchie?  Even though I understand that they secretly loved each other, their relationship seemed totally idealized and UNREALISTIC.  If she was as attracted to Ned as she seemed to be during the implementation of their "plan," there's no way she would have waited all those years to get with him -- especially as into sex as she appeared to be.  And if Ned was as hot as the writer wanted us to believe, why didn't he have more women chasing after him? In the book, he appeared to have no friends or serious interest from women.  All in all, it felt like a very drawn out short story with weak character development and a totally unbelievable story line. Bottomline: Buy this book only if you're into totally superficial romance novels 
 Everytime "Whoa Now" comes on, I flip the channel.  B Rich is a disgrace to hip-hop.  I hope he won't be around for a while.  Look at the album cover, that's the worst I've seen.  Pack yo bags and B Poor 
 Written in difficult prose, Pateman's message appears to give the impression that women are the victims of the original political theorists.  However, I must say one thing: Why is this book still noteworthy?  I've met Pateman on many occasions, and I think it's important to know about her other (strange) political views.  For instance, she believes in the "minimum income," which means that someone will be paid regardless of whether they work or not (that's a great incentive to work--not!); she also appears to believe that women are suffering incredible discrimination in today's workplace, which does not appear to be true.  I'm not sure why she's considered such a great theorist.  Great theorists, in my views, revolutionize how we think about society and promote productive policies that create economic growth, prosperity, optimism.  That is not the case here.  Sorry 
 I agree with the other reviewer.  Errors, errors, errors!  Find a different review book if possible 
 The top doesn't seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering. Also, the bottle being so narrow it's hard to clean. 
 This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 Cute describes these books in the 10-mintues-a-day series.  Pleasant, a little fun, a little insipid.  But, really, not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study.  Actually--in contrast to more than one other reviewer--I found the word-substitution presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory.  This is not an untried method, being also used in the EasyLearn Language audio programs, and other texts.  Those word stickers don't stay on too long, though.  Be prepared to lose a lot of them 
 While I really enjoyed Badami's first book, The Hero's Walk proved cumbersome and tedious. The plot lacks any creativity. It plods along at a labourious and predictable pace. The reader is "told" rather than "shown" everything feeling, thought, emotion. Pales in comparison to Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry. 
 I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 The only reason anyone should have to buy this pathetic anime, is if they enjoy very old anime who's only audience was buidt upon nipple and panty shots.  Do not buy this unless you have seen it already and liked it 
 Hesitation over the title of this review was purely for consideration of people who might have taken offense at the use of homosexuality in the traditional role as a comedic device for dehumanizing people.  In this Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie role play kit, we are presented with two suspect homosexuals, the flamboyant  Black assistant fashion designer, and the quarry closet  homosexual who has to have his disorder pointed out to him, preferably in an embarrassing public denunciation.  Barbie  has to  learn  the  need for her to  script  and  typecast sexuality around  her because she is the sensation (fem fatal) for persuasion predominant in the sphere of people around her.  A Countrified Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie Killer Instinct--role play kit.   And it is perhaps an interesting microcosm of analysis to vaguely note the teddy bear appeal assigned to the openly gay Black character, artistic, talented and unflinching.  It is the idea that for women, gay men make the best friends, that I won't quote yet I seem to have heard it somewhere in the cultural media stream at some time in the past.  Thus a possible depolarizing of "sexual prowess" is covertly used to adjust traditional racial stereotypes, (and that term is taken straight from multicultural theory).   Further complicating the plight of the Black male character in the film, is the Civil War reinactment-buffooning in the presumably lingering prejudicial South, where no doubt the image of African Americans as sexually iconoclastic, bandages wounded  White male libido traditionally injured by jibes of phallic innuendo.  Surely considerate people everywhere are tired of this dredging up of unpleasant or bawdy associations; circumcision is perhaps the original anthrospecific-insult (precursor to sexual dysfunction then marital dysfunction and the whole syndrom of social ills that erode social fabric from its core) but anthropologically the film is enriched elsewhere.    Irving's character Jenny Garp, feminist author, cites being made a "sexual suspect", clearly there are procedural tolls long since put in place to accustom these suspicions of men and women.  Half asleep through the whole movie, I forget the Witherspoon character's name, but she essentially indicts a suspect homosexual male at one point, out of an urge perhaps, to solidify a group cathartic that had pleasantly gone on over the life of the individual in that community as a dissatisfactory standard of humane and non-discriminatory practice.  Barbie's tantrum must be a blood letting, her role is too prominent for softer and tactful, retiring or inhibited social display...she must be the "bell of the ball", the "queen bee" with attendant phalanxes of maidens, a sort of warrior aspect appreciated and encouraged in the feminine; whereas dominant female politicians  must stride more carefully to avoid becoming vilified on a masculine playing field.  There are no masculine defenders of the imasculine, no Garps to befriend gay football players.  Historic Southern  racism is lampooned, only to be replaced with the sexism of preferential or select social stereotyping and discrimination based on repression spawned feminine outlets of gay labeling, a favorite innocuous quarry for young girls influenced by such movies.   It's a man's world, so go kick the "queers", it's perfectly safe.--is the message.  Really it is just a comprehensive green light for offensive young women to go around tarring everybody with the gay label they don't particularly approve of--such sweethearts, somebody slap them.  The gay prompt has grown to such dimensions in the mass medias adverse stimulus conditioning we had to endure the whole "Brokeback Mountain" odyssey and cultural crisis.  Something just keeps wanting to load it into everybody's heads.  Murphy Brown is the elder role model for Fashion  Barbie, what its like to grow up, become a crochety, semi-retired blonde who has scaled political obstacles, become Mayor, wear a suit, and combat the depreciation of appearing older than a plastic toy fresh from the hot injection  mold, while she dotes over the marital selection of her son. Bergen is what happens to Barbies when they grow old, a question that any would be Barbie surely asks, once the question has been loaded for her through symbolism, because just as surely, the pretense of a "Barbie" precludes higher order thinking skills, any anticipatory or empathic reflection--Barbie being the conceited thing it is.  That conceit is no more abundantly clear when the quarry queer, a meek and unassuming character is viciously stereotyped, "Why don't you just admit you're a homosexual!?"  Why don't the movies just admit they're [....] mind control, written by apprentice flunkies who basically jerk-off the emotional susceptibility of innocent victims who paid money for maybe something more enlightening?  Barbie has the decidedly impertinent and socially devastating master stroke saved for when after tremendous wedding preparation, long distance coordination with the big city, hundreds of people, relatives, costumes, food, etc. (a large diamond of course, conspicuously selected in a macabre scene with jewelry store ghouls (...full staff after midnight on overtime...right...only the very best for princess)--night of the living dead materialists in their empty catacombs of display cases), she changes her flighty little mind in the nick of time, and before a well timed downpour that punctuates her contempt for the wedding and the wedding party.  Rese Witherspoon needs these infant terrible outlets, her puckish and perky hypercriticality is what this [....] cesspool of a culture thrives on...or so it would be pawned off on us.  You won't like this next paragraph, oh great ones, but never assume All the munchkins where you pop in to do your do-do (make films)  are salivating and wringing their hands to come to greet you, kiss your shoes, or get your damn autograph.  Salt Lake City must be summoned, like the great unwashed suddenly up for review by some nether world superiors alighting, to appear as extras  in the upcoming romp Legally Blonde II, (radio ads November 22, 2002 call for the comely and college aged, dark suited political types, and young children).  Sounds like the mothership giving instruction for disembarking, all who remain behind are condemned.   And don't you dare walk your walks where you live and cross paths with the film industry's eminent domain, the larger than life have minions of hounds carrying clipboards to accost all who stray into where the "magic is made", Ogden Utah's 25th Street and set for the tv drama 'Hardwood', or 'Viagrawood' or whatever its name was.  The perception is: We are a needed, but despised adjunct to opulence, a rancid and rabble public chattel for them to cull and elect from our insignificance (they pretend to entertain and in fact constantly insult) one or two anointed surfs to stardom.   Who wants to be the next American Idol?  Or, `The One'.  `..or thinks they can dance?'... `...or cook?'    I think its now a rancid (mostly citrus) entertainment media too.  
 Alexandra Chasin makes some excellent points in "Selling Out," some of which I agree with, but I found Chasin's tone to be the book's greatest encumbrance.  She writes about the gay and lesbian community's increasingly consumerist public facade the same way that Trotsky  wrote about Stalinism in "The Revolution Betrayed." Any embrace of consumerism or superficial comfort by an individual is ultimately anti-woman, anti-minority, anti-poor, etc.  For example, an advertisement for DINNERWARE inspired by Pullman dinner services from the 1930s is racist because the railroads kept blacks and Asians in subserviant positions!  Sometimes it sounds like Chasin seriously expected the Stonewall riots to be the next Russian Revolution, and all gays and lesbians should have rejected the post-industrial consumerist society entirely.  Maybe if Chasin herself was living in some commune in Idaho and sewing her clothes out of hemp could I find some dignity in the positions she takes, but she of all people taught at YALE, the traditional bastion of wealthy white male American power and the alma mater of President George Dubya Bush, so I find it very hard to believe that she has rejected all of the values of the bourgeoisie 
 Definetly worth the money, especially if you are a David Niven fan. A good group of films that show the WWII mentality of the times.  A good DVD to add to your collection 
 GA. how can anyone stand this drivel? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly. worse than watching "walk tall" 8 times in a row. worse even than watching the home shopping network. eww. EWW 
 I'd like to give this period tv series higher marks; I love Michael Kitchen's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, and Honeysuckle Weeks as Women's Auxiliary driver "Sam" Stewart is delightful.  Their interplay really makes the show.  It just isn't enough (for me) to compensate for many major shortcomings.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the show weaves contemporary (early WWII) social issues into its plots.  Not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be EXTREMELY off-putting.  Why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area?  Apparently it's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars?!?  Worst of all is Foyle's out-of-character sermonizing, which sometimes takes weird turns, as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he'll be on his case when the war's over.  Not only does this make no sense in view of Foyle's previous instructions, but I interpret the capitalist villain's bemused expression to mean "Thanks for the tip, copper, I'll be getting off THIS flight in extradition-free Ireland!!!"  D'oh!  Well, carry on, inspector!  The show's designers are also a bit careless with PHYSICAL period details.  Usually this is pretty minor stuff, but at least once produces a howler.  In the FIFTY_SHIPS episode, after a lengthy sermon on the CRUCIAL importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of U.S. military equipment ('even though it's just moldy American rubbish'), we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a U.S.-made C-47 (cutting edge in 1940) in RAF colours!!!  As other reviewers have also pointed out, the stories are relentlessly pc.  I have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services; I'm sure that's true of all armies.  But after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman, prejudiced patriot, and cowardly bourgeois I switched to Sherlock!  The unforgivable sin, however, is the cheesy plotting.  It's not just that it's formulaic and predictable, but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow Foyle to 'detect.'  Do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until Foyle pulled a Columbo with the tea bag?  Is there a Gosford Park near this police station?  In conclusion, there're FAR superior Brit and, yes, U.S. detective shows out there.  If you like it pc try Morse; if you're into period try Poirot, Wimsey, or the Hickson Marple.  Leave Foyle unless you're desperate 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 Let me just say that, while I don't own the album, I did buy it for my wife. She loves it. That doesn't say too much for her taste in music, though. She also loves Akon...  I was born and raised in Tallahassee. I listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b. gave, where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket, and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out. That he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the Capital City. There are a couple of issues with that. Like mainly the fact that he wasn't first, or even in the top 5.  You may have to go back a little ways, but all you really need to do is check out a Dead Prez song called (of all things) "Tallahassee Dayz". stic.man himself went to Rickards High School on Tally-ho's South Side. So, he (T-pain) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself (again, and again, and every time they play his damn songs).  Oh, three more things: 1) That video he claimed he shot in Tally was shot in ATL, 2) I wouldn't have given this any stars if I could've avoided it, and 3) I don't know WHAT he's talking about, but there ain't no strip clubs where I'm from.. 
 This is one of the silliest books I have read for a long time. It could be categorised as belonging  to the same genre of "action fantasy" as a number of Hollywood films.  Examples of the rules of reality being abandoned:  The action takes place in the middle of Antarctic winter, and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other.  People spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop out none the worse for the wear.  Two close allies of the United States attack a US installation on no better motivation than a claim that a "spaceship" has been found there, shouted once through the radio.  A 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally.  A prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it.  The stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. There are perhaps people who do not care about any of this, but I don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism 
 My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas.  As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart.  It takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most Barbie houses.  My daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together, so she hardly plays with it.  This toy is definately not worth the money.  I wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy 
 Some novelists are known for a pared down, no-nonsense approach to narrative, firmly delineated, plainspoken characters, crackling, lively dialogue, and swiftly moving, engrossing plots.  Lezama-Lima is not one of those authors.  It's hard to recommend a book that I have so many reservations about.  Yes, the writing is occasionally beautiful, and as an historical document of a certain type of artistic and literary milieu in Pre-Castro Cuba, it's worth something.  But I'm afraid that I'm going to have disagree with all of the reviewers here and say that LL's endless aestheticism must be something of an acquired taste.  The problem is that he writes prose too much like a poet--all florid circumlocutions with no feel for the rhythms of everyday life and speech.  No doubt he would have felt the everyday to be beneath his austere heights.  Nobody talks the way his characters do--it's all lengthy, abstruse theorizing on frequently esoteric subjects.  His essentially elitist approach to writing fiction would test the patience of anyone who looks to literature for a more immediate kind of connection.  And, sorry, Mr. White, LL is not the Latin American Proust--Proust is far more readable and speaks to more basic human experiences.          Sometimes some of the worst snobs are those (i.e., homosexuals) who have themselves suffered the most heinous abuse because of their dubious social stature--rather than reject the values of the mainstream, a writer like LL ends up embodying them and perpetuating them to an infuriating degree through his snobbish affectations.  Or else one could view his aesthetic vision as essentially escapist, understandable given the political situation in Cuba at the time.  Still, a more accurate view of what was actually happening might have been of more human interest--it would have been valuable to see how these characters strained to maintain their sensibility in view of what was actually occurring around them.  But, as it is, the book seems to exist in a vacuum with no real connection to the political situation in Cuba--its Eurocentric preoccupations offend.    
 cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top  poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it  putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.  again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting  pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
 About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.   The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.   To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.      
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 The greatest actress in the world deserves a masterpiece of a biography-and this book is no masterpiece. Aside from many inaccuracies, it's weirdly short on information about it's subject. Entire sections are about other people (eg. the inspriration for Jane Tennison-interesting, but not appropriate in a book about someone else!) The author seems to be trying desperately to fill his book, and too much of it is useless information. A real disappointment. While I collect every movie and item I can get my hands on that has Helen Mirren in it, not even I would buy this book (thankfully I found it at my library). Any pertinent information it contains can be found easily on the internet. I hope a good writer out there is planning on honoring this divine woman with a stellar biography. It's long overdue 
 Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem.  I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar.  This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.    Where do I start?  First off, the font size is terrible.  So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant.  Then comes the print type.  It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage.  The printing is extremely bad.  Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy.  Was the typeset dirty?  Did you run out of ink?  True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus.  But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?  How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.   Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.  That is how one presents a text of significance.    If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day.     
 I bought this feeder to take care of my cats while I was away on weekends.  At first everything was great so I kept it running every day.  After 2 months of daily use the feeder stopped working.  I exchanged it for another feeder of the same model which the broke after another 7 months.  Maybe it will work better if it is limited to short periods of operation, but do not get this feeder if you plan to use it every day 
 I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.  Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it.  Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.  No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it 
 It was great while it lasted, but the garlic press handle broke off easily, and we had to replace it with a sturdier brand 
 First, allow me to clear up a widely misunderstood notion. "Minotaur" did not receive its bad rap solely because it initially aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. A vast number of elements, unrelated to the Sci-Fi network, contributed to this particular disaster. From the monumental lack of competent direction, the nonexistent writing, and laughable acting, "Minotaur" would have easily doomed itself to failure on any cable channel. What particularly troubled me the most about this film, however, was its inexecusable waste of two outstanding talents.  Rutger Hauer and Tony Todd. "The Hitcher" and the "Candyman," for crying out loud! How did these two guys get suckered into the throw-away roles they have here? They both deserve so much better!  And, uh, not to burst anyone's bubble, but wasn't the Minotaur supposedly half man-half bull? I do admit my Greek mythology is a tad bit rusty these days. But I do seem to remember reading up on this specific legend in my younger years as a grammar student. The critter in this here film seems a little out of place. "Theo," our main hero, might has well have been wearing a matador's outfit and sporting a red cape throughout the entire proceedings! Seriously, friends, I was waiting for an off-camera studio audience to begin peppering the action with shouts of "Ole!"  Now, I love creature features just as much as the next guy. And I have also defended the sort of films most other people could care less about. But this one was just plain bad! I was very disappointed.  You are hereby duly warned. Rent, if you must. Just don't expect an epic "Lord of the Rings" style blockbuster. To paraphrase an old saying, "I've seen better film on teeth."   
 Messenger has a very thin plot. A messenger of Satan is seducing postal workers in a small Florida town, getting them to graphically murder as many people as they can before killing themselves. It isn't so much a plot as a device for the author to write one violent, gory scene after another, all leading nowhere. I think he must have gotten paid by the number of times he wrote the word blood, bloody, blood-soaked, blood-covered, etc.  This is a bad novel. Violence and gore are no problem if they are integral to the story but here, they are the story and nothing else. The dialog is so over the top it makes you laugh, the characters have no depth and no one behaves or reacts the way a real person would. The author bio says Lee has 15 novels in print. I hope they all aren't as useless as this one 
 Yes yes we all know the mega hit When I See You Smile. But it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole.  The band hits gear pretty early with Best of What I Got but after that it's pretty bad. How Possession ever became a hit I've not idea. Well, where I come from it didn't, but in the US this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits.  The production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album. Neil Schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck. Besides, he probably wanted some revenge on Steve Perry so he really wanted to make some cash. Pity, listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man. Rockin' Horse for example.   An interesting additin to the AOR landscape, and some of the music is lively. But when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just doesn't get my vote. Even my devoted AOR fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track (we all know which one).  But hey, if AOR is your bag you could do a lot worse 
 What the hell is it about summer and a corny movie about dancing that involves some dude who totally doesn't fit in. but threw his dancing abilities he shows everyone they're wrong about him.  Every summer we have one of these "feel good" movies that involves a ton of dancing.  The soundtrack is what I'm revewing though, where do I begin? Oh, I know, how about most of these songs don't go together.  We've reached a point where "Now that's Pop" cd's are huge sellers.  I'm not saying these songs are bad (some are, some aren't) but most don't really fit.  Random good songs make for a pretty bad soundtrack.  There is no flow here, it's too all over the place for me.  The Sean Paul & Keyisha Kole song is pretty smooth, as are a few others.  As a soundtrack it doesn't work though 
 The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho 
 Becareful, I read a review here that said that this is the book from PBS... It IS NOT. I bought the book after reading the review and just sent it back. It is not even by the same authors who wrote the PBS book. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this sounds like  a scam job at the expense of children and their parents. I may have kept the book if I wasn't so upset about being deceived. If you are looking for the PBS book it is called "The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions" by John & Danita Thomas. I have sent an email to the authors about this rip off book, I hope they take some type of action 
 "Footsteps" is not the first novel you want to read by PA Toer.  It should be the third.  PAT is a great writer, no doubt; it's a shame he was never awarded the Nobel Prize that he deserved.  As for "F", it does not have the edge that the first two novels in his famed Buru Quartet - "This Earth of Mankind" and "Child of all Nations" - have.  It's not a stretch to say that reading "F" is like watching the third Godfather movie:  it just doesn't have it; but you watch anyway.  And so I read it.  It reads more like a slow-paced political history of Indonesia, and the best parts are when characters from "TEOM" and "COAN" make an appearance.  I will definitely read the fourth book in the series.  PAT is writer that you can't help but admire, but "F" just didn't resonate the way his other novels did (for me) 
 It really shocks me that so many people are tripping all over themselves to sing this guy's praises. He does write interesting lyrics (I'll concede that much), but in the end, if you can't sing and you can't play guitar, you have no business calling yourself a musician. Music should be pleasing to the ear. This is just pretentious, self-absorbed garbage. I'm convinced that the vast majority of Bright Eyes' fans are just trying to appear intellectual to others. This guy should give our ears a rest and start writing poetry for a living 
 It's just three Urban Legend Movies put together, so it's typicaly the same thing, and the same bonus features.  URBAN LEGEND is a movie about those terrifying tales turning true as a college has a serial killer with those motives. 2/5  URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT is the movie that is the worst -- and I mean it, it really does suck. At a film school, a movie called Urban Legends is being made, and another serial killer comes slicing the crew members. 1/5  URBAN LEGENDS: BLOODY MARY is different from the first two. It is a slasher flick, but with a ghost killing teenagers. 2/5   So it's the same old thing. Three DVDS just put together. And I suggest you buy Urban Legends 1 and Urban Legends 3. 
 Brenda Maddox missed her calling in life: she should have been a writer for one of the tabloid newspapers in the grocery-store checkout lines. With  an eye for whatever is unflattering or sensational she has combed the  archives and written an account of the later decades of Yeats's life that  lacks intelligence, dignity and any real expertise about Yeats's work.  Little of what she relates will be new to scholars in the field, but then  they aren't the real audience for the book, which obviously is intended to  rack up sales. That the author relates Yeats's faults is acceptable; but  that she exaggerates them, and fails to put them into a proper context, is  not. For example, the fact that Yeats as an old man suffered from various  physical infirmities is for Maddox a subject almost for derision, whereas  the normal attitude would be to admire all the more the courage of his  refusal to capitulate to "devouring Time" and the greatness of  his accomplishments as an artist whose work improved throughout his life  and who preserved his passion for perfection in the writing even of his  very last poem. Little is actually said about the poetry and plays in this  book and that little is almost all derivative or naive. There are also  numerous errors of fact and the book has been sloppily proofread. The  potential reader will be well advised to save his or her money for the  responsible studies of Yeats's and his wife's lives currently being  prepared by Roy Foster and Ann Saddlemyer. (Foster's splendid biography of  the early years was published in 1997. 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 If you've never read any well written and insightful books on technology adoption (such as Lewis Mumford's "Technics and Civilization") then perhaps parts of "The Change Function" may appear profound.  However if you had, then this text will find you wishing you had spent your time and money elsewhere.    People won't use technology that's hard to use? Profound.  People only learn a new way to drive to work when the old route is under construction? Brilliant.  Coburn goes way out on a limb to predict what technology will succeed...are you ready? Flat screen technology and Blackberries (mobile enterprise email). The man is a psychic.   On top of the lack of anything remotely fresh in this book, reading The Change Function is a bit like reading a version of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations; except the people being quoted are not familiar to you...unless you are one of Pip's blog friends, who receive endless attributions throughout the book.    Please save your time and money. Re-read Telecosm (Gilder) with an eye for how so many actual predictions (not like Coburn's Monday-morning QB stlye) were wrong.    BTW - I predict hybrid cars will be big in the future 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 What do you get when you mix global warming, an artificial intelligence named Gea (instead of Gaia), German idealist Friedrich Schelling, Catholic mystic Teilhard de Chardin, Russian Orthodox mystic philosopher Nikolai Federov, and a guilt-ridden far-future post-human networked mind in need of atonement?  Apparently, you get reams of turgid telling-not-showing exposition followed by soporific sermons about how humans can transcend themselves to become gods (or, as in the case of the net-mind Transcendence, a sort of Godnet 2.0).    Perhaps the soul of this book is the Catholic Priest character, Rosa (of course the Vatican has lightened up on that male Priest thing), who tells us Federov drew on "Marxist historical determinism, socialist utopianism, and deeper wells of Slavic theology and nationalism to come up with a 'Cosmism,' which preached an ultimate unity between man and the universe."  As you can see, Rosa has the soul of a GRE question writer on a bender at the Burning Man festival.  I love a rip-roaring space opera.  I also love mind-bending far-future speculation.  Unfortunately, this book is neither rip-roaring nor mind-bending.  Take a pass 
 I was very disapointed in this book.  It seemed more like a collection of facts than a insightful biography.  I felt I learn little about the two man that I could not have found in a enclopedia 
 I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???   Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!   
 As the name implies, it was "just plain stupid."  Better luck next time Lois 
 "Oh, if only America didn't exist, or at least didn't act in its own best interests" whines the Left.  "Then we'd have an international Communist utopia!"  It's not our fault that liberty, rather than totalitarianism, is the answer to the human condition.  That's just the way the world works.    That's why so many people are willing to risk their lives, facing pirates, sharks, drowning, and being shot by their homelands' armies to get here.  And it's amazing how well they do once they arrive!    Other countries put up walls to keep people in -- communist countries, most of which collapsed because their "democratic" economies couldn't create wealth.  We, on the other hand, live in a country that needs walls to keep people _out_.  And leftist whining about it won't change a thing 
 This is nothing more than a owners manual. If you bought a new computer it came with one, read it .... It didnt answer 1 thing I wanted to know. Most of the things in this book I have done and I didnt even read my owners manual. If you were given "just" a computer with XP on it and you knew "nothing" about a computer, this would be an OK book 
 Since purchasing this "Executive" set, I have purchased another one at a local store.  Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better.  The sea monkeys in the "Executive" set lasted about a month and a half.  This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague.  We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them.  The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months.  I believe the "Executive" set is overpriced as well 
 It's hard to believe that this book is meant to be taken seriously even though the author might be a conspiracy buff. The conspiracies range from the ridicilous to the completely absurd. Some conpiracies are even contradictory, USA faked all Moon missions or Neil Armstrong encountered a moon full of aliens and their structures. The book offers a lot of opinions and wild stories presented as fact without any proof. Belzer's fellow "conspiracy researcher" Jim Marrses theories presented in the book are the most absurd. The Moon is a spaceship built by aliens because it couldn't have formed any other way and its gravity is too weak to hold it together. Sounds really good, if you don't know what a Physics book looks like. Belzer also mentions many times that ancient texts are full of referances to aliens. The only proof being that, when you forget about the ancient culture's gods, rulers, complex mythology and take the texts and images completely out of context and forget about what real historians say, the images and text might talk about aliens. Belzer also says that aliens don't land on the White House lawn for all to see because they don't want to and sane credible people see aliens all the time but don't want to tell anyone. This kind of circular logic also proofs that pink flying elephants are real.         
 This book is purely a self-promoting guide for the company that put it out.  While there's some useful information for the pre-first timer (such as your truly), the "book" exclusively focuses on their services.  If you are interested in self publishing, there are other books, such as the more independent "Complete Idiot's Guide to Self Publishing," available for not much more in cost than this book - although if you decide to go with Outskirts Press, the print edition of this "book" gives you a small discount - more than covering the cost of this "book" - towards one of their publishing packages.  BTW, this guide is available in PDF format from the company on their website.  You just need to give them your first name and e-mail address to download the e-book 
 I found this book interesting and at the same time extremely frustrating. There were many times when I wondered what the author meant by descriptions that were unclear. She often skipped important information and sometimes added it later. It seemed as if she wrote from a perspective of being currently immersed in her eating disorder, rather than it seeming like she was looking back with insight, even though she was over it when she wrote this book. I wanted to know what her various symptoms and behaviours meant, but mostly she didn't explain them. This book seems to have been written from a New Age perspective (despite the author claiming she was a Catholic). I found her writing style a bit mystical and confused. A worthwhile story and a page-turner, but it needed a lot of editing and re-writing 
 This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. A real waste.  I do not beleive that Mr. Gabay has handeled the subject sucesfully.  Frankly anything I have learnt on copwriting was through reading the "Copywriters Handbook" by Robert Bly.  While Mr. Bly can identify was able to identify successful copwriting campaign by various organisations Mr Gabay could only resort to a fictious company called  scotsdalenorth...i guess because he was not able to identify and discuss sucessful copywriting ad campaigns.  If you are an insomniac..I would recommend this book.  It will definitely put you to bed.   I am suspicious of all the five star rating that this book got. It was on this basis I made the purchase...regretfully.  I want my money back..you book is pure garbage!  Look if I wanted a lesson in English I would have bought an english book...the title of you book is misleading...I seriously question whether you do know anything about copywriting...sayonara.  PS- I only chose  a 1 star because there was no zero star.  
 The premise of the book seems to be that you won't recover all of the money you spend on improvements let alone make any.  The book references remodeling magazine as a source of obtaining a dollar cost and value added.  Again, cost is always higher than value added.    Another fitting title might be "improve the value of your home by 100,000 dollars while spending 130,000 to do it!"  I strongly recommend that people read through the table of contents and possibily skim through it if you have the opportunity.  Read one of the chapters and you'll see what I mean, then decide if it's right for you.  Most of the chapters follow the same format with different projets.  Unfortuately for me, I already bought it based on the amazing scores everyone else gave it 
 The book is entertaining, and as long as you already know the correct use of the English language, you might enjoy the read. The author presents us with a self assured "I am right, and PLBPLBLB on those who may disagree..." type of attitude, which would be OK if only the author was correct. But the book is full of errors and opinions, along with correct and accurate information. So, if you can sort it out yourself, you're all set. Otherwise, I'd find some more qualified authors work to base my education on 
 Louise Gluck is one of those bland poets that happened to be in the right place at the right time. That this bland book has won a pulitzer just shows how the quality doesn't matter, but rather WHO is getting it. These poems are filled with teenaged cliches "I speak because I am shattered", "At the end of my suffering, there was a door," etc. Totally banal, generic, and poorly broken with an occasional puff of language here or there. Really these 'poems' are just prose broken into lines. Her imagry is dull, and not really worth discussion. The reviewers who 'liked' this book do just that, since there is no critical logic that can be applied to these 'poems' to even remotely call them good. Gluck is a total lightweight, one that will, once dead, be recycled to the cannon of late 20th cent. literary fodder of one of those yet again, another overrated pulitzer winner with so little to show for it. A prise can no longer be worth much if this is the mediocrity that is winning it. And yes, I am right about this. 
 Poor story....poor character development.  This reminds me of the Trek  books 20 years ago that placed Star Trek characters in minor roles so the  author could use his own created personas.  Hated this book and the entire  series 
 This textbook is so long winded. When it tells personal stories related to the topics, it is very interesting. However, when it gets technical, boy does it get technical. It seems as if it wants to confuse the reader on purpose. The index is worthless. For example, a question on the test will ask about the Neur men, look for Neur in the index and you get nothing. However, it is in the book. The glossary is just a contnuation of the confusing overly technical speak this book does too well.  Bottom line, if you have a decent prof. then this book will suffice, otherwise be prepared to feel like you are being tortured for the secret rocket code. 
 I bought it from Tomtom web page I own an ipaq hw6515 never had a problem with the Navigator 5 ( previus version) in more than a year, after installing the new Nav6 with USA & Canada maps every time that needed to auto recalculate the route the screen freeze, the good part the voice still given you the directions even the screen problem. New features, Nah, nothing to get excited. Botton line I lost my money deleted the new & installed back the old version 
 I was expecting to learn some of the "lingo" of NASCAR.  That was the main reason for buying the book.  I enjoyed the description, etc. of the race tracks.  Did not like "where to go" or the scrapbook.  I thought it would explain a little more about actual racing and race cars, etc.  Good thing I didn't spend too much on the book 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 While the born again crowd will no doubt love this book, those who respect cultural and religious diversity will be appalled 
 Read The Complexity Advantage by Susanne Kelly and Mary Ann Allison it's a better book. Or better still check out the reviews before you buy 
 The first part of the book is unbearably slow,  the gender differences of boys and girls are painstakingly boiled down into a litany of "boys excel at..., girls excel at.  The list that everybody has heard, sports and spatial tasks = boys,   penmanship, language skills = girls.   The saving grace of this book is that in the 2nd part the author mentions what should actually be done.   Michael Gurian, author/ educator, also has a few pilot projects being run in the state of Missouri. The results sound encouraging.  He encourages teachers to start catering to the needs of both genders in the class. He stresses that to do this teachers will need training.  As for parents the usual "be a concerned and supportive parent" is always added.  I was generally unimpressed with the book, no real blockbusters. The real world results of his pilot education programs were to me the issue that maybe the author was onto something. Hopefully if it is as good as its portrayed this method will gain some notoriety. 
 Root shock was an okay of a book. It was very one-side; Fullilove never considered the other point-of-view. She also attempted to capture the reader's attention by supplying the readers with full size pictures that took up an entire page; however, she failed to get our attention. The urban renewal process is interesting, but she took so much credit for supplying the information, when in reality, it was the interviews that supplied the information about the process of urban renewal. The book was okay, but it can be skipped. 
 There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't remember & don't really care for.  However, the sound quality is good.  Take the time to listen to all the samples before buying 
 The title of the book is nonsense. Abraham Lincoln is the most misunderstood figure in American history. He was an individual from humble beginnings who betrayed his nation for greed and power. As an attorney, he represented corporations and the wealthy and powerful. As President, he defied the Constitution and law by forcibly preventing the Southern states from lawful secession. Of course, he also illegally imprisoned newspaper editors, conscripted the poor and immigrants (while permitting the wealthy to buy their way out of service), suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus, manipulated the freeing of the slaves only from those states which seceded, promoted racial discrimination and their return to Africa, and was primarily responsible for the death of more than 620,000 of his countrymen. Everyone should read "The Real Lincoln," a book which contains the true facts about this dictatorial fool. In other more civilized nations, slavery was abolished by payments made by the government to the slave owners, acknowledging their prior lawful property rights. It was the law and government which permitted slavery. Lincoln did not argue against slavery. To the contrary he only "freed" the slaves when he was losing the war. Then he committed countless war crimes by burning and destroying entire cities and murdering civilians. A war built on lies? Does it sound familiar? Our historians are not worthy of the name 
 Whatever happened to Elizabeth Lowell's steamy romances like "To The Ends of the Earth" and "Winter Fire"?  "The Wrong Hostage" was...well, it was boring and confusing.  There was so much unnecessary dialog about Mexican politics and drug lords that I just tuned it out. (Oh, I listened to this book on CD.)  There was zero chemistry between Grace and Joe and only one steamy scene between them. This was very slow moving to the point that by the time I got to the last CD, I was so bored that I just wanted it to end. It was way too long; way too complicated; definitely not worth the time it took to finish it 
 I checked the date of publication on this book several times thinking that this was a reprint of one of Ms. Drake's early books.  The writing is so sophomoric that, other than the sex scenes, it could have been written for teenagers (or by a teenager).  Do yourself a favor and order MR. IMPOSSIBLE by LORETTA CHASE.  The story takes place in Egypt and is a GREAT read.  Pass on this one.  
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 I've enjoyed Pavel's previous works, and find his insights and knowledge refreshing when compared to the mainstream; but sadly I can not recommend this book.  The Russian Kettlebell Challenge is 143 pages long and in my opinion, the majority of the book is filler--I counted only 66 pages with valid information on Kettlebell lifting (and that's being generous).  There are eleven blank pages (fifteen counting the four section pages) and sixteen pages that were a maximum of half full.  The first two sections of the book (32 pages!) were comprised of the history of Kettlebells, and Pavel's reasoning on why they're so great.  This book reminded me of one of my college term papers were I had procrastinated until the last minute, and used every possible technique to stretch the length of the paper.    At $34.95, this book is definitely not worth the price.  
 It is odd, and perhaps a bit sad, that John Irving has become or became American's literary sweetheart.  Given his narrative concerns, it would seem a wide readership would have never been his fate.  For one, he is fixated on the mutilation of the human body.  This mania with mutilation borders on the near fantastic in The World According to Garp. And more disturbingly still, is it completely infiltrates the narrative's sense of sexuality.  For the narrator of Garp, sex and bodily mutilation are nearly synonymous.  And what is the purpose of this overall fixation with the lopping off of limbs and the act of sex?  In The World According to Garp, sex is not viewed as a healthy or even human impulse.  It is only when the major characters divest themselves of lust, or sexual activity, that they extricate themselves from most of their mental woes.  It's a grim vision.  It is hard to envision flocks of readers gobbling this book in the late 70's and early 80's and viewing it as the great voice of our (or their) time.  The novel is also written on a high level of generality.  No reader should expect to plumb very deeply into the human condition in this novel.  Like Garp's writing itself, Irving's prose is witty and salacious, but never really gives the reader any serious human dilemma to masticate and digest.  There is something to chew, but it is light fare.  
 This is a most curious and frustrating disc, especially for Lang Lang and Gergiev fans.  Lang Lang begins with the chords that begin Rach 2 with a very slow trudge - taking after Richter on his classic DGG recording?  The orchestra is fine at their entrance, but things begin to unravel.  So much episodic feeling to things give away the lie of any notion that this may have been an unedited live recording - before the past 25 years, always the meaning of the phrase 'live recording.' On first hearing, it even sounds as though Lang Lang is helping to keep things together.  On rehearing it, Lang Lang's lack of any musically imaginative response to the music, as opposed to plugging in so many tired formulae, gets wearisome quickly, though he gets over the notes and rises to the climax of the movement well.  Much of the slow movement goes well, barring a little too much backphrasing, that already has gotten well underway in the first movement, too much of a stall at the end of a long trill already, and lack of legato in the chords that end the movement.  Gergiev begins the third movement sluggishly and with lack of march impetus.  One accelerando by Lang Lang seems more than with which the orchestra can stay together.    I had the local NPR affiliate play Kissin and Gergiev, a 1988 (?) recording, before anyone over here in the West even knew who Gergiev was.  The orchestra is the London Symphony, which does not always play together either, but here they are in very close to top shape, and any pointing of detail seems headed somewhere, since the legato line is never broken, except where indicated or clearly indicated.  Kissin plays beautifully at the age of 17(?).  The Paganini Rhapsody even, two thirds of the way through, goes less well. If so much of this disc gives a new twist on how to phrase this music, either work on this disc, have we not heard the accent placed on the wrong note (the second note of the phrase instead of leaning into the D-Flat), breaking the line, in the 18th variation - and the worst offender here is Valery Gergiev. The orchestral playing is nuance heavy, fine on the lighter variations, but indicative that the orchestra can not play together otherwise or is under-rehearsed.  The passage of seventh through tenth variations turns into a struggle - and not in the sense that raises musical tension.  The ninth variation, of broken and off-beat triplets is overaccented, for sake of keeping things together, throwing off a truly effective rhythmic way of playing this passage, as the music demands.  Sure, it is difficult, but one expects more from people coming onto the Yellow Label to record this music, after what predecessors there have been (Pletnev/Abbado at least an equally inept exception to the rule).  Lang Lang's tendency to put little dovetails and effete endings to so many phrases does indeed recall Liberace (as does especially the D-Flat Nocturne on the Carnegie Hall disc).  It also intrudes onto the spirit of the music.   The 'doing the riff' on the fifteenth variation, so old, shopworn by now, shows similar musical and artistic immaturity, as do several little backphrasings from Gergiev to abet other silliness from the soloist here.  Not the worst possible recordings of these two works, even the Rhapsody, but certainly not recommended above eight to ten other versions of each of these pieces either.  The Ashkenazy/Haitink and Kocsis/De Waart sets are very positive recommendations, even though Paganini Rhapsody is the weak link in the former series (not in a two disc set of the four concerti) and PC 2 the same for the latter - both still preferable to this.  Tamas Vasary plays his set very well, if a bit inflexibly accompanied at times, on DGG.  The classic Richter (DGG) and Rubinstein/Ormandy are worthy considerations for PC 2.  Rubinstein and Reiner did not perform together well, but up next to the new release, you'd never guess it, on both works.  In mono, the Moisewitsch of PC's 1 and 2 and Rhapsody on Naxos is ideal, and the price is right.  Sound quality is fine for the period (if a bit dated). Margrit Weber and Fricsay, for the Rhapsody offers great orchestral playing, the best I have heard yet for the piece, and supportive pianism, if not commanding in this situation, but it is, after all, as Rachmaninov composed it (and as forgotten somewhat by Lang and Gergiev), an orchestral work.  Even Cliburn/Reiner (on PC 2 at least), and I am no Cliburn fan, is preferable to what is heard on the new disc.  There are certainly good versions of each I am forgetting to mention here, including the classic RCA recordings by the composer.  Space allows me only so much.  :- 
 To believe this inane tripe by P. Jeffery, you have to assume three things:  1.) Smith **somehow** managed to perfectly imitate Clement's style and fool all the experts on Clement. 2.) Smith also **somehow** managed to perfectly imitate Mark's style perfectly AND actually fill in the lacunae in the Gospel text. 3.) Smith **somehow** managed to expertly forge the text itself.  Are we to assume that a biblical scholar of Smith's stature would attempt to ruin his career by creating a hoax? And then make cryptic references within the text to INCREASE his chances of being caught?!? Absurdity.  Bottom Line: Mr. Jeffery, please go and carbon-date the ink/parchment of Secret Mark and stop embarrassing yourself 
 This film is about as weak as I remebered it to be when I first saw it 50 years ago. I only took it because it came as a package with Rock Around the Cloc 
 This is a poorly written textbook; rambling and fragmented information is presented on a piecemeal basis rather than in a clear, concise and well-organized manner.  Important information belonging to one subject-matter chapter, is often presented as "aside" information in other chapters on wholly different subjects.  This textbook appears to have been written by an author who forgot to take his ADHD medication.  This "substandard" quality has become common place with this particular publishing company, Prentice Hall, to include its many subsidiaries (Pearson, Thompson, Southwestern, etc.), to the detriment of the education system.     
 While this may have been a good collection of essays at the time of its publication, it is now painfully outdated, retaining only historical interest 
 Generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'End Time', and when the predicted dates come and go, is anyone dissuaded?  Of course not. They just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date. "No, really, THIS TIME we KNOW we've got it right."  Because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred, who want it all to be about 'ME'.  "I" will be there when it all happens. It's all for "MY" generation. It's all focused on "ME".  LaHaye and Jenkins  clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.  Nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race 
 I didn't have the patience to go through the entire book, but now I'm curious if James Randi has listed himself as one of the personages of hoaxes.  From the glance through the book, other than inaccuracies, there are numerous entries that have absolutely nothing to do with hoaxes or frauds.  For an example an "adept" is a person who has reached certain level of self-mastery (as in mastering your thoughts and emotions - which would be like Randi learning to speak and write Chinese and unable to do so claiming that it's a hoax - well, it could be a fair comparison.  This book is otherwise so full of errors that given the fact that Randi is potraying himself as an "expert" of the topics he never really invested time to learn about or thoroughly investigate - one may as well conclude that Randi is a "fraud" - after all here is the evidence.  Those who are applauding to the quality of this book, would do better to cross-reference the information with some trustworthy sources - as in, if you really want to learn what goes on in the field of quantum physics, then you should consult with reputable people from the field or quantum physics if you want to know about making shoes, consult a shoemaker and not your five year old child.  If you want to learn how to speak Chinese, then you should consult with someone who has managed to speak it.  If you want to make sure that you never learn it, then get someone like Randi who can guarantee to drill into your mind "it can't be done!"   Imagine how much progress we would've made in this world, if Randi was our leader, constantly reassuring us that humans cannot do anything useful with their minds - I guess we'd all still be living in caves.  Forget about cars, airplanes, computers and such - if Randi was in charge - none of that would exist today.  Sad, but true!  Now, do you still wander why Randi comes true as so angry and sarcastic?  Because he has talked himself into impotence (I don't know about physical one - but a mental impotence for sure!).  You just let him guide you, and you're bound to end up in the same state of happiness that he has.      
 I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER.

 Why would Whoopi Goldberg be starring in such a stupid movie, and why would Alexa Vega starring in this movie. I can't believe this movie was ever made 
 While this book boasts excellent print qualities, along with top notch photo reproduction, it lacks any real information of substance. If you are looking for a book to help you learn the ins and outs of medium format,  keep looking. It will not help you with the intricacies of lighting,  composing for medium format vs. 35mm, or any other "important"  information for the neophyte medium format photographer. I was looking for  this type of book, and I was sorely disappointed after reading this title  in one evening. Please Mr. Ericksenn, try again 
 Dan Rather writes excellent stories, including those which are completely fabricated.  Take the new "memo" which Rather seemed to have come across.  Not only was the memo found to be false, but Rather is a suspect for writing it.  Rather should resign and at least keep his dignity, and rid the american public of at least one liberal news anchor 
 The printer works great as a usb printer, a fax machine, and copier. It may as well not even have a network port on it. The networking driver will find the printer ,but then it goes back to searching for  a printer, and this loop continues till you give up. I can't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem. I can tell you that a Dell 1600 works great as a network printer, network scanner,  fax & copier. We have 3 of these and we tried this Hp 3055 and I would not reccommend it to anyon 
 It's a nice concept. Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, HP Lovecraft, and Marie Leveau are part of a secret society of demon-busters dedicated to fighting incursions of the Lovecraftian mythos into our world. There are cameo appearances by famous mystics A.E Waite and Aleister Crowley. The problem is that first-time novelist Wheeler isn't really up to the task of fleshing out all of these colorful characters. Conan Doyle sort of works as a real-world incarnation of his literary creation and Houdini is not bad, but HP Lovecraft rings false as some kind of steampunk technomystic, and voodoo queen Leveau comes across surprisingly bland. There are also some serious anachronisms. At one point, Lovecraft is described as using a "transistorized" device. Transistors? In 1919 
 Silone's communist message is outdated. More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.  His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. 'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.  Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.  Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.  What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.  I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit' 
 I would have given this movie 5 stars instead of 1.This is without a doubt the scariest movie ive ever seen in my life.it was originaly released in 1985.the reason im giving it one star.is the movie demons on dvd,is not the exact same movie released on vhs video in 1985.they have redone it on dvd.and taken mosalot of the gore and hard rock out of the movie.The reason is Anchor bay.the movie was originaly distibuted by new world video.then anchor bay got there hands ahold of this mordern marvel of terror and redone the movie,they cut out alot of the gore,alot of the original rock music was completely taken out,when the womans on the theatre stage and transforming into a demon.you see a bright lite shot on her and you can see when her tounge shoots out thats its a mechanical pupet.in the orginal the lighting was kept dark and they may have been the reason.If you are one of the lucky ones to hold the original 1985 release of DEMONS on vhs from new video you have without a doubt the scariest horror movie of all time.If your one of the unfortunate ones to get the new dvd you will be left in the dark on what was once a true horror gem.i happen to have the 1985 copy of demons.released in the aqctuall year of 1985.i vdieo store went out of buisness in my home town.i remember the day they got it in 1985 like it waqs yesterday.i purchased the some 20 year old copy from them in 2001.my copys about had it its 21 years old..i wwish i could find an oruginal copy.cause u nolonger can get it now.i wonder if they have done the same things to demons 2 the nightmare returns i wonder if they cut and edited it 2...talk about being crapped on....IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE ORIGINAL demons first off saty away from the dvd.go for teh video and make sure it says 1985 on it and not 1999 on the side.. 
 As stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea, but it is so small it barely fits my [...]. It will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off. He gets very frustrated and so am I. If I have to re-velcro this thing again I am going to scream, and he only got it this morning for easter. I called fisher-price but they are closed for the holiday...I plan on calling again tomorrow and I WILL be getting some sort of refund....hey maybe I can score a free Field Journal. HAHA... Good Luck To You All. 
 I was hoping to get some tips on how best to stroke my python but it turned out not to be too focused with herpetology after all but covers "stroking it" in much more general terms...   When faced with the enormity of my python I'm at a complete loss - many people have commented on it - it's been known to bring a tear to many an eye.   Oh well, the search for fun and fulfilling ways to engage my python continues.. 
 It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.  As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that "Day of the Locust" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.  "Locust" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.  But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.  It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in "An Englishman Abroad". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.  It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...  Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, "Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot.   To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a "symbolic" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours.   Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before "Miss Lonelyhearts" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after "Locust" appeared. Then they went and made this movie. Remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair. 
 I think potentially the only part of this cover that is not horribly photoshop'd is the dude's face.  I like the real bear smoking the cartoon cigar tho, that was a nice touch. 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it 
 I picked up a 1 Oz tin of same brand for 14.99 in Dallas are 
 The prime rib slices I had were pre-cooked and they are terrible. Nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home. They lack in both flavor and texture. The remaining slices I have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 These guys are the worst. I wish they would crawl in a hole & never come out. One of the worst bands of our era 
 I was disappointed that the "Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead 
 I love reading Tamara Hayle's mysteries, however this is the second one that I have read that was a disappointment with the characters and the climax of the mystery.  I truly wish Ms. Wilson will create a more exciting  love life for Tamara, starting out with maybe a steady man in her life.  I  also suggest better clients for her excellent skills and a more exciting  role for her son Jamal instead of the usual unsteady teenager.  I hope  these suggestions will help in the next novel and I look forward Ms.  Wilson 
 Thanks to Walker Percy a manuscript about a rotund medievalist with a pronounced aversion to gainful employment was saved from the dustbin.  Unfortunately, Percy's own works, variations on Russian humbuggery doused in southern discomfort, often slip into an existential coma. The Last Gentleman barely has a pulse. After an engaging opening with a baby who emerges from a hurricane, the novel gets downright tiresome. When examining the limits and conundrums of human freedom, Percy lacks the subtlety of the far superior storyteller Robert Penn Warren. In this instance, Percy's women are insufferably tedious, his men only slightly more amusing. Mr. Vaught induces a grin in seersucker, but the protagonist, a nearly transparent figure known as the engineer, has the charm and presence of an expired june bug. He talks nonsense with a jumbled up girl and, in a fugue state, wanders around for days not knowing his name. After a while, the weary reader prays he'll wander across a busy freeway 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 Yes.  I read the reviews for this book, and was encouraged, thinking I was getting a good beginner-intermediate level guide for programming games with DirectX.  Boy, when I dug in, I was almost immediately overwhelmed by the complexity of the code samples (many of which do not even compile; they use declaration types that are not supported in any includes......yes, I included all of the proper files and linked them).  The author gives you several pages worth of code, saying "This class does this; this function does one thing, that function does another thing, call this function to...do whatever"...the list goes on, and on, and on.  The author never goes into detail explaining what the code actually does and more importantly, HOW IT WORKS.  He just says "create this object to do this, then call that function" throughout the entire book.  Never does he explain what you are actually doing and why it is important.  It is bad enough that he gives you pages of source code, then he leaves you on your own to make it work.  His writing already assumes that the reader knows DirectX through and through.  Code samples are also incomplete a lot of times and the reader is left with no clue to what a certain variable/object is because there is no declaration.  AVOID THIS BOOK.  IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY 
 	While I realize that many readers enjoy approaching a topic through the author's personal experiences, people like myself will find much of this book self indulgent.    	Other parts of the book deal with the things like the adoption community (see the Families With Children From China website instead),   and the single child policy.    As a long time member of  Zero Population Growth I can hardy be impartial on the latter, but why spend an entire chapter on the single child policy if later on you are going to say that gender ratios in India are even worse?   	 	I expect that one of the target audiences for this book is parents deciding whether or not to adopt from China.  While I myself would strongly recommend it,   I am also one of the parents the book mentions for whom the lack of identifiable birth parents was a major selling point.  Of course, many adoptive parents have the opposite desire, and perhaps they might consider places like Korea or Guatemala (Obviously domestic would be even better for those adoptive parents, but it might be considered impossible).    My Korean niece and nephew know what city their biological parents are from, their occupation and why they were given up for adoption. They could probably find their biological parents very easily if they ever chose to (They are in their teens and have no desire to do so as of yet in spite of their parents urging).   Under Guatemalan law the birth mother must remain in contact through the entire adoption process, signing off multiple times, including at the end of the process.    I read of one couple who suffered the heartbreak of a delay because the woman who claimed to be the birth mother failed the blood test so the child was not eligible for adoption.  	With this in mind, the place where this book and I part company is in approaching an adopted child when all you have to go on is one sentence in an adoption report.  I strongly agree with the expert who is quoted in the book as saying "Tell your daughter the truth.  Tell her you don't know where she comes from."  as well as the author's friend who says "I think there is not the looking inward in China that you imagine".   Therefore I wince when the author says about an imaginary conversation with the birth mother that "I imagine this partly out of my own projection and wishful thinking, I know.  I want my daughter to have been wanted." Or that "You have to assume that love was involved."  The vast majority of adoption literature that we have received specifically says not to tell your child that the biological parents loved them.  Even the literature that does recommend  telling  the child that the biological parents loved them then goes on to urge you not to tell your child that giving them up for adoption was an act of love, as love then becomes equated with abandonment.  One psychiatrist was quoted as saying that many of his clients are in therapy because of such statements.   This book never explicitly encourages such statements, but I expect that many readers would take it this way.   				------------------Ed 						Tianan  				  
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 As a fan of Frederick Buechner, I found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy, reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade.  I found it disappointing, as he focuses on his  collection of Buechner  family memoribilia.  As hard as he tries to universalize it, making it accessible to all of us, for me, it just didn't work.  And it reads like  a review of one's summer family reunion.  Sorry.  Read his other stuff.  It's great! 
 Alain Daniélou's assessment of the dionysiac cults is somewhat naive. The Dionysaic cults are by no means just about free, ecstatic love and religious tolerance. As René Girard has shown, these cults are most of all about the sacrifice of an - innocent - scapecoat in order to regularly release the tensions which again and again build up in a society. Pagan societies, which do not know forgiveness, need this form of tension release in order to preserve or reinstate their unity. The origin of the dionysiac cult is the cruel and indeed ecstatic murder and paradox divinisation of the founder of a culture/society. In Indian mythology, for instance, Parusha was torn to pieces and out of the pieces came the four castes. This founding murder is again and again repeated in the dionysiac cult. Archaic forms of this cult used to sacrifice humans, later forms animals. The Holocaust is a modern form of dionysiac ecstasy. Daniélou of course does see very clearly that dionysiac ecstasy is tension release. What he does not see or know is that mere tension release is not all that is possible in lovemaking 
 I am teaching a business math class and was issued this text book by the college.  While reviewing the book I found it to be more confusing than helpful.  I found the majority of the ideas presented in the book to be of common knowledge.  Rather than presenting the concepts in the book in an analytical manner, the author uses a personal narrative to convey the ideas.  The author introduces new concepts with successive chapters, but does not explain how these concepts are derived.  The author explains concepts at face value, rather than explaining how the concepts come about and how to apply them to other situations outside of the ideal situation.  The first 6 chapters or so, out of a total of 22, are a review of basic math skills starting with addition and subtraction of whole numbers and continue to basic uses of percents.  In addition to those 6 chapters, more of the successive chapters become redundant and are not presented in a logical order.  Integrated into the text are numerous amounts of extraneous articles that are meant to reinforce the underlying point, but instead simply add bulk and distraction to the text.  I found that the concepts of the book are poorly presented and are not explained thoroughly.  I would STRONGLY recommend not using this book, especially for a college level business class.  A person with little to no everyday business experience would find this book to be very simple. In my opinion this book is primarily geared to a 9th grade level education in a public school system and not a college level class. 
 Don't buy this piece of junk! Thier voices are computerized and they wern't supposed to become a real group! Cheetah Sisters is really annoying,Cinderella is awful with those "OOOHHHHS" over and over!Play is better at this song! Girl Power gets really old and boring with the video being played over and over on Disney.Together We Can,even 7 year olds skip it. C'mon,No, No, No not rap!!!! Sonic Chaeos are more annoying then the Cheetah Girls, I give 1 star because of Hope 7's "Breakthrough" is kind of rock.End Of The Line is too sad and 1 minute long. Girlfriend is just too awful to mention!The Special edtion with the remixes is more fun and makes the Ep better.So if you really want to listin to these girls buy the special edtion and skip the first 8 songs 
 I was pretty excited when I saw this book, but it was quite a let down when I received it. Over half of the book deals with science-fiction instead of fantasy and it also includes lots of computer made art. The best  artists of the fantasy art world were left out. There are some interesting  pieces in this book, but it was not really what I was hoping for 
 black and blue is the name of this horrible album which these backstreet thugs blatantly and unashamedly stole from the legendary stones.this music reeks.it is one of the worst of the worst.AN ABSOLUTELY AVOIDABLE TRAVESTY OF AN ALBUM.get the original black and blue album from the stones instead.minus trillion stars 
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 If you're looking for fictionalized fluff of how "Rubber"--Mr. Eugenist himself's biographers who write deliberately inspired falsehoods to promote the Bush cause; then here's the book for you!  George and his Skull & Bones cronies -- including daddy Prescott, grandpa Walker, the Harriman's, et al. -- fed this self-alleged war hero from the not always so covert Eastern Establishment's-based silver spoon from an early age. GW is no war hero! He illegally entered the War at too young an age. Then, flailed in the cockpit when multiple eyewitnesses saw "Poppy" George Bush bail on two crewmates sending them to their deaths. Or maybe not? With each election he had set up that he won he'd change his bio and rhetoric to suit the constituents.   Fact many times over tells how father Prescott cashed in on the banking he did to supply the Nazi-killers and the only reason he wasn't nabbed for war crimes like one of his associates was due to one of his other cronies getting the post to pick & choose who got prosecuted.  The story goes on but its not to be found in drivel such as Flight of the Avenger, "Plucky Lad" , "The Family" or any authorized bio of this evil family.   Much of the downright evil can be backed up with diligent research, if you care to look it up in reputable media of the times.  One such book that has much respected documentation is Tarpley's unauthorized biography of this flight [as in abandoning his mates] of an avenger.  Registered Republican 
 I didn't find the book to be as good as her past novels.  It didn't hold my attention as well 
 The China Moon cookbook offers many wonderful and unique recipes for lovers of asian cuisine. However, this book is definitely NOT for the cooking novice or for people that desire dishes that involves simple preparation. Most of the China Moon recipes requires the use of several different types of aromatic oils and spices that you need to make YOURSELF - which consists of several different types of ingredients that A) may be difficult to find in your local grocery store or B) needs to be prepared in some fashion before using. After spending hours/days/weeks chopping and cooking spices just to prepare special oil(s) (that you'll use only a couple of tablespoons worth), you'll think to yourself: 'Is this really worth it?'. Not only that, but the book insists that you make your own chicken/vegetable stock! And yet again, this involves combining several hundred different oils, spices and ingredients to make X amount of stock that you will only use 1 cup worth in a single recipe. Sheesh! After being discouraged by how much preparation and labor it involved to make a single dish (the 'simplest' dish calls for 2 oils)-I've only used my China Moon cookbook twice in the past 6 years. The dishes are impressive and tasty, but I would only recommend this book for people that really LOVE to cook or have alot of free time 
 If Dennis O'Leary is a friend of theirs (after promoting this CD on Comedy Central) he should send them some new guitar strings so the band members can garrote themselves. Talk about a bunch of "songs from the darkside"...Jeez, all I can say is if you want to be depressed, go ahead and buy this. 
 I stopped reading a few pages into the first chapter. I couldn't quit thinking about the ridiculous false statements in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st chapter. First it says "the pilot decided to crash," after the engines catch fire, but he doesn't actually crash. Then it says the cause of the fire was because the spark plug gap was too wide which "let raw fuel run straight through the engines and out the turbines and there it had ignited."  The part about crashing is sensationalism. The part about the sparkplugs is completely wrong since they have nothing to do with the flow of fuel. I'm sure the topic of this story is true but with that many errors on the first page of the first chapter I'm going to find another book on this topic I can trust 
 This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked 
 I have to agree with the other reviewers who have pointed out that this novel is simply not very good.  With so many quality endtime novels that explore the concept in a superior way, it's become obvious that The Third Millenium is just a [copy] of Left Behind.  Both We All Fall Down and the Christ Clone novels are far superior to this boo 
 Definitely not for younger children.  Best for advanced readers and children with lots of years experience in coloring.  However, by the time most readers would understand the text, those same readers would probably not be that interested in coloring, so I am not at all sure what interest bracket this book would fall into.  
 I WAS a huge PJ fan, heck I collect b-sides, imports and anything I could get my hands on.  While I still enjoy their older music I can not respect political cheapshots.  Case in Point: Bushleaguer , come on, seriously have you completely run out of ideas.  I know that they are bleeding heart liberals/socialists but could you inject some intelligence into your songs/lyrics.  Why not a song called ClintonDecay about the moral decay of our society?  I do listen to bands that don't follow my politcal leanings, i.e. SOAD.  Their song BYOB is obviously about the Iraq war but they pen it smartly.  They don't say "Why don't Bush,etc. fight the war?" instead they say "Why don't presidents fight the war?" which makes a political statement, however, it is not dated and sophmoric; heck they could be talking about the Civil War and Lincoln 
 Paul Auster's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I've experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.  But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker. This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks 
 I just had a hard time reading/understanding/finishing this book. I did finally finish it because I wanted to know the mystery behind the author's father, but in the end the whole book was disappointing. I guess it's a matter of the book's structure. The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters. Some of the language sounds awkward, the curse words seem...forced. Also after a while, the author's unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves 
 Unless you are really interested in all the petty arguments about religion among the protestant, presbyterians and baptists this book is not for you.  Data on the Scots Irish people themselves makes up less than 25% of this book and even then it is more into quoting what this official or that official had to say.  You don't really get a feel for what the people were like or why they were the way they were.    If you want to understand our ancestors and what drove them, read "Born Fighting : How the Scots-Irish Shaped America" by James Webb.  Not only does it bring these early settlers to life but tickled my intestests enough to buy more books on the over-mountain people and Andrew Jackson. 
 I love the title--it's worthy of one of the funniest, most intelligent people I have ever met only one time (that would be Kinky--I had the priviledge of meeting him at a book signing in NYC).  I love Kinky Friedman.  Were I a female, I would probably consider compromising my virture for a vigorous roll in the hay with him but paradoxically, I really hated this book. It's not the worst book I ever read but it's one of those books where you read for 15 pages and suddenly become aware that some significant event has occurred but you were so bored you didn't even notice.  Out of my loyalty to the Kinkster, of whom I have been a fan since the Jewboy days, I read the book to the end but once I closed the book, I felt like I had to shower to remove the overpowering odor of the mildewy plot.   Speaking of the Jewboys, I wish Kinky's sidekick Jewford would write a book. That boy's funny. 
 I saw Shout About Movies on TV and thought it would make a fun gift.  Turns out I was right, the game is fantastic and great fun.  The trivia ranges from Quotes, Movie Stills and Scenes from Movies.   The only problem is that after you play the title's initial 3 games, the disc is useless.  You see, the Shout About Movies gives you 3 games to play at the start.  Each game has the same layout of rounds, but uses different questions.  Sure questions are different between games, but if you replay a game, you get the same questions and answers thus ruining the replay factor.  For $20+ I would expect a little more than 3 games.  I really like the game, but I can't justify spending another $20 for the other discs with zero replay 
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 This book is a good example of an author flaunting his formidable language skills instead of telling the story. In this book he digresses often into fanciful descriptions of things that do not have even the most remote relevance to the story.  Read an abridged version or watch the movie, but don't subject yourself to the unabridged version 
 As a Western seeker interested in Eastern philosophy, I found the idea behind the book very attractive, but the book itself is shallow, pointless pap.  You can learn a lot more for free just by surfing the Web 
 The fact that the story is left unresolved isn't particularly an issue for me... In my opinion, the movie is decent, but the plain truth is that it is simply not that interesting. Of course, it is a good premise... basing a film on the human ability to deal with guilt. The writer has chosen a random and mundane situation, I'm sure intentionally, to delve into for the story, but it just isn't all that good. The acting is mediocre, the pace is painfully slow... It's just not right for everyone. I have a high tolerance for a slow-paced film that eventually leads you somewhere, but this movie was slow-paced and led me to a disappointing ending. 2 stars for the idea, but that's about it 
 Being a cliffs study guide, I thought this book would be helpful, but it is NOT.  I had to get another book that would actually help.  The book just lists important names and places, and rarely explains them, resulting in you having to look up in the textbook all of the answers.  It was worthless.  The end multiple choice part was fine though 
 Just another typical manipulative book by a so-called christian psychologist giving her own personal 'bible interpretation' of what marriage should be, using all the usual 'techniques' and lacking knowledge of what marriage is really all about. Despite the emphasis and talk about "submission", what you will really find is how to deceptively use "power" to get what you want 
  The theme suggested by the title is fine, but the author does not stick with his agenda. This book is full of erratic observations, not least the notion that Jung was a fellow traveler with the Nazis. Anyone who has read Jung at all well, would know that he devoted considerable energy to the task of trying to understand the 'unreason' which seized hold of the German spirit (Jung actually regarded it as a kind of collective 'posession' by the spirit of Wotan). Unlike Heidegger (and Nietzsche), Jung remained grounded in the positive values of Western civilisation - including democracy. He did not turn his back on 2,500 years of Graeco-Roman/Judeo-Christian culture. To allege that he did is sheer nonsense and exceedingly poor scholarship.   Unfortunately, Wolin seems utterly unable to see that there are paradoxes in life - and human reason. In his assessment, America comes out as the exemplary source of 'rational' culture - as against a quirky Europe, prone to unreason and crippling scepticism. But, in its present mode -dominated by Neo-con philosophy, advocating 'full spectrum dominance' ('Amerika uber alles,' we might say) - some scepticism seems needed right now. There is a new 'Macarthyism' at work in the USA - and it is driven by hubris and UNREASON. 'Star wars'is hardly the attribute of a 'rational' culture. America has few friends in the world today  - and why? Because its current administration has abdicated from the principles ostensibly lauded in Wolin's book. Quite rightly, that worries many Americans - and platitudes like those served up by Wolin will not make the problem go away.    The zenophobia in Wolin's book is part of the problem - not part of the solution. For Wolin, even Europe is 'alien' - so, how much more so is he likely to find problems relating to other, non-caucasian cultures? In this sense - a fatal flaw runs through Wolin's book. He fears fascism - but advocates an agenda whereby one culture stands in judgement of every other, ready to use force - if needs be, in any corner of the world - to protect and assert its alleged superiority - and that, by definition - is fascism. Paranoia and reason don't make good partners. 
 Willy Wonka meets Dr. Strangelove in this one-of-a-kind cinematic disaster. Barry Levinson's longtime "dream project" emerges as a garish nightmare. The impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big-budget quagmire. Another unfilmable concept that somehow received the Hollywood green light 
 This book is just poor.  The information is just light weight, the suggestions on how to sell yourself will make you come across as either an amateur or scam artist.  What should be the most important section on contracts is severely lacking.  This book is not for people who are actually serious about going into contracting 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 "The Island of the Day Before" is a sad relic from a talented and brilliant author.  Certainly people will go on praising Eco (as they should), but TIDB remains a flacid exercise in overplotting.  Eco has become a sort of literary Andy Warhol - selling his name more than his work.  In trying to achieve a Kafkaesque "portrait of an instant", Eco merely puts on display what was better left as a study or exercise to be burned after his demise.  The Island of the Day Before lacks virtually all of the elements that make a story worth reading.  Indeed, Eco's inversion of the rules of good fiction is the main attraction for his works.  But in The Island of the Day Before, the reader must trudge through all of Eco's autoerotic complexity solely for the sake of that complexity.  Following is a parody of the sort of nonsense that permeates this book:  "Robert opened the door to the cabin, and was confronted with the object of his dread.  From the planked ceiling hung a hemp rope, knotted every three inches with an inverted half-stitch, each pinned through by a tortoiseshell ladypoker scented with ambergris.  At the end of the rope, approximately four feet from the floor, and thus fourteen hands from a point bisecting a line drawn between Robert's right elbow and the cleft of his chin, was a metal hoop.  The rope was fastened to the metal hoop with an overwrapping style, which Robert immediately recognized as the "Bosun's Burgher" favoured by the Patagonian fishermen.  The metal ring was welded to a torus, and the center of the torus circumscribed a small teak box with a brass hasp and seven lotus shaped inlays.  Each of the inlays contained a tiny portrait of one of the seven sybils standing on one of the seven hills of Rome, but only five of the sybils were depicted with their hands upraised.  The other two sybils hand their hands clasped behind their backs.  The first of the sybils with upraised hands was holding a rod, which twisted along its own length, with radial spikes of hexagonal cross section, each of which was terminated by an inverted cusp which was in turn pierced by a crescent.  The ends of the crescents spiralled back in upon themselves, but they alternated, with some facing right and some facing left, and still others, in a trick of the artist's skill, facing directly toward the viewer's navel, no matter where one stood... 
 i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it 
 And what are those words?   Why, simply put they are:  "DENZEL WASHINGTON IS NO FRANK SINATRA"   Any questions?  No, I didn't think s 
        They were handing these books out for the parents at my old school so I decided to read it.          First of all,  Kevin Leman seems to be a very conservitive republican.  He says you should read your kids the Bible to show them that God wants them to wait until marrage for sex.  This is not called "A Guidebook for Christian Parents," so I'm sure that people of many other religions are reading this book.  Also, if kids want to have sex, parents telling them not to is not going to stop them.  If you tell them just not to do it, they will go at it anyways without any protection.           In another part of the book, he says that a divorce can cause girls to sexually mature faster.  What he is suggesting is to not get divorced.  What he did not mention, however, was the effects that fighting parents can have on children.       He seems to think that all teenagers are ashamed of their parents and will not listen to them just because it is the parents that are telling them to do things.  Can you get any more steroetypical?  I'm sure if any teen saw their parents reading a book that all it does is describe teens they would be furious.  This is because NOT ALL TEENS ARE THE SAME!!!!  Just because we are under the age of 21 does not mean we all have a little conference and plan how we are all going to act the same way and  make our parents miserable.        For the good of your children, do not buy this book.  Remember they are individuals!!!!  And just for the record, his "humor" is pathetic!         I know I am going to get negative feedback, and I understand because there are the arguments that I am only a teenager myself so I don't understand things about raising one.  But I hope that you try to understand my views because, after all, this book is about people like me 
 I bought this bed for my son who loves superheroes. I thought it would look great in his newly redectorated room. It does look great if you can manage to get it together. The instructions that came with the bed were not clear or detailed. It uses hex screws to assemble it, it does include a small wrench, but that is a pain.  With me and my huband working together to assemble the bed it took us 4 hrs to do it. We have put togehter many beds, cribs, and other things over the years, this was HIGHLY difficult. The rails that support the mattress were not manufactured properly. Thankfully my father-in-law uses the same type of metal piping at his factory. We replaced what came with the bed with metal piping he made. The piping the bed came with would not stay in the slots, the piping was cut an half an inch too short. So anytime the bed was moved, wiggled, or sat upon the they would fall out. Thus making the mattress fall onto the floor.  My son was so happy to have gotten the bed, and when we had to tell him that he would have to wait a day before he could use it he was heart broken. All together once it is assembled it does look like the photo. I would NOT have purchased this item if I had know that it would require so much work and us having to replace parts that should have worked in the first place. The superman photos that are on the bed are large stickers that you have to stick on the headboard and footboard when assembling the product. The bed also comes with an asortment of screws and bolts to assemble the bed with. In the packaging they are NOT clearly marked so that you can tell the difference between them. It was difficult deciding which screws to use, and the screw holes in the material was NOT alienged properly. My husband had to re-bore most of the screw holes on the frame just so that we could screw and bold the bed together. I do NOT recommend purchasing this item unless you are prepared to work on it. The only good thing about this item is that it does ship quickly. I had it in less that a week from the order date. 
 Sleazy 70s exploitation film with some panache                                 features super-agent Ginger chasing down white slavers.                                 Ample sex and violence will please certain contingents  while                                 semi-feminist heroine, campy dialogue  will satisfy others 
 I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach.  We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun.  Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him.  One of the supports had broken.  It was the first time I'd used it.  I was very disappointed 
 The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do 
 This is ghastly stuff.  I bet the the Anti-Defamation League,  ACLU, Hate Monitor, and other organizations would love to have a go at this.......  I'm not surprised that the author touts himself as a big game hunter.  Clearly it is not enough to get off merely bashing gays and Liberals etc.  One has to resort to big-game hunting.  What an anachronism........yawn......... 
 Although I would normally give 'Shadows in the Sun' 5 stars because it is a wonderful film, beautifully shot with some stunning landscapes of Tuscany, I can't help but give it 1 star for the dreadful pan-and-scan (4x3) DVD presentation forced upon Region 1 viewers.  Buena Vista Distributors should be hung, strung and quartered for releasing such a dreadful presentation on the US market and at a price of $29+ it proves that some studios are just plain greedy and hold their customers in contempt.  Surely they could have obtained the original anamorphic master digi-tape of the movie for US release.     The  good news is that the film was shot in anamorphic widescreen, (1.78:1 - enhanced to 16x9).  The bad news is that the NTSC version is pan-and-scan, presumably re-edited for TV.  They have 'forced commercial breaks' into the film, that's why there are so many 'fades to black' where the storyline does not justify them.  Before the end titles scroll up, the picture and vocal song fades to black, and a pan up to the sky and part of the vocal are lost.     Well, if you want to see the film in all its glorious anamorphic (16x9) widescreen presentation, with exceptional picture quality and color saturation, buy the Region 2 PAL version from amazon.co.uk.  The picture is so sharp you would think HD couldn't look any better!  The audio is somewhat superior too!  The disc also contains the same extras as the US version.  What a difference the correct screen ratio transfer can make to the complete enjoyment of a movie, in the way it was originally intended to be seen!  5 Stars for the movie - 1 star for the terrible NTSC Region 1 version 
 I thought that this book would be about geometry of exotic (but real)  places in outer space (such as a black hole, for example).  Instead, it  turned out to be a lethally boring book, full of math problems, that was  LESS interesting than my geometry book in high school 
 Josephson is regarded as one of the semi-classic EP textbooks, but on the evidence of this edition, this may not be justified. The text is verbose, turgid and hard to read, and the numerous electrograms are poorly reproduced, making them hard to read and interpret. In retrospect, I'm not sure that this book was worth purchasing. The publishers need to clean up the text and improve the quality of the electrograms to make this a worthwhile purchase 
 This book, while pretty as always, falls way behind WotC's usual standard.  The amount of actual content in here could have filled a Dragon article and then it was packed with 50 so-so examples.  Please note: In order to use a legacy item, you must take a feat at 5th level.  NO character gains a free feat at 5th level.  1st, 3rd, 6th, etc.  So this sets back the rules by a level, which are subpar compared against the magical weapons available at those levels anyway.  Am I the only one who noticed 
 I purchased this item for my daughter through the military exchange based on the connectivity options it offered.  The item came in well packaged in a double box with QA stickers across the opening seemingly indicating that the QC department check it out before shipping.  First of all it appeared that the item had been previously used.  The batteries for the remote where nowhere to be found, there was a quick start guide that seemed to have been crumpled into cellophane.  The unit is made of thin plastic and comes with adpaters to accomodate varying iPods.  Once the unit was connected to the speakers and power my daughter inserted her iPod and immediately started playing music.  The sound is below average and there is no equalizaiton or tone controls to adjust it. Next up was the radio.  FM Reception was fair, apparently it comes with a loop atenna for AM but that was also missing so I didn't test AM.  Next up the CD, first it was an MP3 CD, no luck, a copied CD and regular CD failed as well. There are more sources that can be used, i.e. various memory cards but I had seen enough. It's now packaged and ready to be returned.  Stay away from this one. 
 First of all, in this book Monique said that she weighs 220lbs.  I dont think so.  Maybe at one time she did, in high school.  I dont think she was really being real in this book for some reason.  I read the first chapter and maybe 2 pages into the next chapter but couldnt get any futher.  Instead I looked at the black and white pictures she had through out the book.  Being as I dont have anything to read at this monment I might pick the book up and try to read it again in one of my totally bored moments.  Other than that, I really expected more out of this book.  Glad I borrowed it from my sister instead of buying it.  Better luck next time Monique 
 7 loong and boring songs.  an insult to folk music 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 The author endorses genocide of the white race, This is now acceptable in our society. He should be run out of the country 
 Samuel Jackson, Juliette Binoche...I thought it's gonna be a wonderful movie. To my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.  A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!  Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some money with this crap movie by LOSING their chance to ever film again! Never ever I will watch a movie with Samuel L. Jackson or Juliette Binoche, again. I'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of "movie" that wastes your precious time 
 TEXAS INDICTMENT  Poker champ accused of sexual assault  Legendary poker champion Amarillo Slim has been indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges that he inappropriately touched a 12-year-old girl, authorities said Monday.  Amarillo Slim, 74, whose real name is Thomas Austin Preston Jr., was indicted Friday on three felony charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, said Sgt. Randy TenBrink of the Amarillo Police Department.  TenBrink said the girl reported to her mother that Preston had "inappropriately and sexually touched" her on Jan. 1, March 13 and March 14. The mother reported the allegations March 25. 
 This product seemed to have been designed by someone who had never used a humidifier before. The water tank is nearly impossible to fill; there's nothing to hold on to once the tank is upside down, and the opposite end is sloped so you can't rest it against the bottom of your bathtub while it fills. Once it's full, a juggling act is required in order to screw on the tank lid, since you can't set the tank down anywhere. After trying twice and only succeeding in spilling water all over myself and the bathroom, I left this task for my husband to take care of, as he has very large hands and was able to fill the tank more easily, although he too complained that the tank was so poorly designed.  The tank capacity is too small; to keep my bedroom at a good humidity level, we have to refill the tank twice a day. Still, the thing did what it was meant to do--humidified the room--until after three weeks the full tank leaked all over the wood floor and area rug. We thought the top must not have been screwed on correctly, but it happened again, warping the wood floor. Leaving the full tank in the bathtub, it didn't leak at all, which made us think that something had gone wrong with the base.   I didn't waste my time trying to get this thing fixed. I returned it 
 Too bad for this guy, can't make much money off the China Threat scare these days. One of many retards who weren't very focused on the real threat back in pre 9/11 2001 
 The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped.   
 Despite what T. Smith (another reviewer) states, Jesus was under no vegetarian obligation.  God has made multiple covenants with his followers, and in each covenant the previous one was replaced.  Thus post-Noah followers could eat meat, and post-Jesus followers had no obligation to be kosher.  Which brings me to my main point: why should one feel any significance in eating what Jesus ate?  He was still obligated to follow the kosher rules of Deuteronomy, while modern day Christians are not.  If the book is kosher, it need not be, and if it isn't, it can't possibly contain what Jesus ate.  Jesus was kosher.  Basically, this is a pretty stupid premise for a book.  Eat what you want - God won't care 
 This book's biggest failure is its assumption that its readers will share the author's own political views.  Cass Sunstein is a well-known academic, whose articles have proven extremely illuminating and helpful to many.  This book has none of those characteristics.  Though his articles on the regulatory state have changed the way I think about statutory interpretation, I cannot say this book  persuaded me at all.  The author strongly criticizes "fundamentalism" (perhaps better known as "originalism").  He warns the reader that because "originalism" is aligned so closely with conservatives'/Republican's political views, that it must be the case that the originalist view suffers from bias.  The author does not anticipate that some readers, such as myself, are socially liberal, and yet find textualism and originalism appealing.  His arguments thus failed to speak to me-- he tells the reader that originalism= conservatism, and yet i believe in originalism, but am socially liberal.  What gives?    He then takes cheap shots on originalism, which he should know better than to make.  He marches out a parade of horribles that would result if originalism were accepted.  For example, he argues that school segregation may be permissible, the EPA's authority may be proscribed, etc. etc.  He does not take into account many originalist's view (including my own), that if it were not for the Court's legislating from teh bench, that the political process (via Constitutional amendments) would prohibit discrimination, and expand the scope of agencies' powers.  His myopic view is all the more startling when one reads his defense of "minimalism" (Sunstein's preferred view).  Sunstein states that we should accept the Constitution as it is currently, but that one should take "minimalist" approaches in providing any further changes.  The critics argue that Sunstein is simply happy with the current Constitution, and ergo espouses the "minimalist" view, to which he responds:  "Suppose perfectionsits really can show that their approach produced a number of decisions taht are desirable and that no other approach could have generated.  The principled minimalist responds:  So what?  If the Court had not acted, the democratic process might have done so instead."  Yet, in hypocritical fashion, Sunstein launches into a tirade against originalism, arguing that that approach reaches undesirable results.  As an originalist, I'd argue:  "If the Court had not acted, the democratic process might have done so instead."   Sunstein does not allow originalists this defense, and it is shocking that he would nonetheless use that argument himself.  This is a better book than you will find by the likes of Ann Coulter or Michael Moore.  It is not a bad book, but just very, very disappointing to those who expected more from the author.  Given Sunstein's unbelievably brilliant law review articles, I'm shocked and disappointed by his patently biased discourse in this book.  I refuse to believe that he, in good faith, actually believes the arguments he makes (he argues, for example, that originalism is tantamount to the "rule of the dead";  yet, Brown vs. Board of Education was written by judges who are now dead-- would he suggest that we ignore that decision because those judges are dead?  Surely a man as smart as he understands that we respect legal texts because of the process they went through to attain the status as binding law, and not out of reverence for the dead).  I could not help but feel that this is simply a thinly veiled attack on conservatives.  I do not mind people attacking conservatives-- i'm a minority/atheist/social liberal who also cannot stand "jesus freaks."  But, when an author as accomplished as Sunstein parades a political attack as an academic work, I cannot help but be disappointed.  I give this book 2 stars, and not 1 star, because people who feel insecure in their originalist views should read this book to see that many of the criticisms of originalism are quite specious.  I hope he writes again on the topic-- I would be very interested in reading what he would say about a subject like this if he made a conscious effort to remove his political views 
 I bought this book because of an interest in intuitive design but learned  nothing. It is 99% photos that get boring about mid-way through. The whole "read" took 15 minutes. The commentary at the end is too general to be of much use.  This book is yet another product of the impressive IDEO PR machine.  If that interests you, you might want  to get it. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book. Just not enough value here for the money 
 This wasn't a bad CD, but it was NOT what you typically think of when you think of Manheim Steamroller music.  I was expecting electronica patriotic music.  I got a kinda old trucker country sort of music.  No wonder it's so cheap compared to the other MS cds.. 
 This translation loses the vigor and sharpness of previous more classical versions.  She interjects too much pop psychology 
 I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.   That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.   
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 This story could have been an interesting read but it wasn't. It was like a story boringly told by a narrator. Terrible read. It was not like a true story book at all. The intrigue,suspense and mystery were missing. I felt like I was reading a bunch of articles clumped together. It was very boring,I had to skip many pages at a time to get through the book it was terribly boring. Very Disappointed. 
 This book has nothing to do with demonic possession. This is a book about a woman suffering from a personality disorder. It leads the reader on a detailed, longwinded, rambling journey of the woman's self-discovery on the root source of her disorder with the help of a psychologist.      This book is more aptly titled: "cholecimla: a study of multiple personality disorder."   Numerous typo errors were encountered in this book.  
 White author Andrew Hacker mercilessly flays Whites and shamelessly sucks up to Blacks. 'Two Nations' is for Whites who want to feel guilty about being White, and Blacks who want to blame their troubles on Whites. For  people truly interested in race and culture, I recommend buying Thomas  Sowell's 'Race and Culture' . . . and returning this book to your public  library 
 ***This is a discussion about certain points in the book, and may be considered to some a spoiler, so please do not read if you want to remain surprised about the book's high points and/or outcome.***  I expected to read this book and feel inspired by the obstacles that were overcome by Chris Gardner as he rose from a poverty-stricken child living the hard knock life to a successful adult with many moral achievements. However, this was not the case. Shortly into the book, I came to realize that most of Mr. Gardner's problems were self-created. Sure, his upbringing was a contributory factor to some of his issues. But mostly, he made some very bad choices that resulted in some very bad outcomes.  First, I disliked how he constantly put his mother, the woman who allowed herself and her children to be beaten time and time again by her husband, on a pedastool. This was a woman who went to prison twice, once for welfare fraud and once for attempted murder, yet we are to believe she was the epitomy of moral conscience? In all fairness, it is respectable that Mr. Gardner continued to idolize his mother, even after his rough childhood and the abuse to which he was subjected at home. However, this woman exemplified so many reasons why she was the complete opposite of an ideal role model for a child.  Second, I thought it extremely irresponsible of Mr. Gardner to discuss not being able to afford to put food on the table for his wife and child some days, and in the next sentence to talk about getting high with his buddies to "take the edge off". Certainly the drugs were not always free. Was he spending the family's grocery money on drugs?   Third, I disliked how he rationalized listening to jokes containing the infamous "N" word from the rich oil tycoon, simply because this same man was fattening his pockets at the time. This tells the world that such a situation is acceptable, so long as someone benefits enough to overlook the insulting word. I also found it absolutely disgusting how Mr. Gardner, immediately upon hearing of this oil tycoon's death, sold every bit of stock in the man's portolio, even though he himself admitted that all stock sales should immediately halt once an estate is in probate. Mr. Gardner stated that the oil tycoon, in the days before his death, had requested that all of his portfolio assets be liquidated (never mind the history of 30-35% capital gains), and that Mr. Gardner was only carrying out his final "orders". I call Mr. Gardner's bluff on this one - he sold that stock just to make a final commission. Mr. Gardner showed a true lack of ethics in this situation.  Finally, and most disturbing, was how Mr. Gardner sent his son to live with Jackie after she had already once abandoned the child. She had proven herself once to be an unfit mother, yet Mr. Gardner sent his son across the country to live with her after he starting achieving personal financial success in Chicago. If his main concern was the welfare of his child, why did he not keep little Chris with him?  Overall, I am completely dissapointed with this book. Mr. Gardner may be hailed as a hero to some, but he is most certainly not a hero to me.     
 I think they have the age range wrong for "Another Important Book."  Rather than being for 4 to 8 year-olds, I think 3 and under might be more accurate.  Certainly my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) had little interest in this book.  They found the drawings too babyish and the content just did not spark any calls for another reading.    Counting to 6?  I've found my toes?  Just all 'non-starters' for preschoolers and kindergarteners, unlike the original "The Important Book" which dealt with observations of the world around us.  Two Stars (for the 3 and up age range).  Check the images that Amazon has provided to decide on appropriateness for your child.   For those interested in revisiting babyhood with older children we suggest Margaret Miller's "Now I'm Big" 
 Before I bought this book I was looking for a smart way to invest in real estate and decided to buy the book because of its high rating. Bad choice! Never buy a book in Amazon just because of the good rating. I've been investing in real estate for 2 years and wanted to expand my knowledge in the field with the help of this book. Bad choice! The 12 easy steps the author is referring to are useless. You are better off learning by experience. I thought the book was "ELEMENTARY" with the oversized fonts and childish graphics. I felt like a kid reading a night time story. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is an absolute waste of time. You are better off keeping an eye on the current market situation and make your moves by experience. 
 I have only heard of (and heard of and heard of) the left behind series. I wanted to start with book 1, so at my local library, this was the best I could do, until book 1 of the original series comes available at my lib.  The narration/production of the 9 cd audio book is horrible. The point of view of the author is good and the story, for someone with no contact with the plot of left Behind, kept me interested but boy do they drag it out for the first 7 cd's.   And the writing!! The writing stinks on ice.   It is a testament for how badly people of faith crave modern literature that endorses their point of view that the series sells in the trillions.   There is a huge almost totally untapped market for books that take a faith-positive approach.   It became very clear around 1/3 of the way through that this book was written to continue to feed the demand for these books and nothing else.  The imagery is as empty and barren as can be. The only character that held my interest was Rayford. None of the other characters, and I mean none were interesting in the slightest and the writing just dragged and dragged. A 2nd year college liberal arts student could more reliably deliver the goods than whoever this pair is. Awful. Embarrassing.  Finally, near the end, they realized that they had filled enough pages to satisfy the publisher and put the foot to the gas on developing the plot, such as it was. The character of Nicolae's mother, Marilena, is about the dullest, emptiest, non-dimensional character in any book I can recall. I seriously would laugh AT some of the narrative. There are parts that are worthy of an SNL skit, they are so over the top and corny. She can't realize why her son doesn't love her. "Hello!!! you Sold your ******g soul to have a child sent by Satan. Were you expecting Ricky Nelson?" Sheeeshhh. Dime store novels got nothing on this.  Having said all that, I will attempt to obtain the original series starting with the 1st book and see if the authors just had  a bad day at the office with "The Rising".   Stay away from this 
 I consider Charley Varrick Don Siegel's masterpiece and one of the very best American films of the '70s (and that's saying something), but Universal's  pathetic DVD release is an utter insult to the film and its fans.  I have written Universal to complain, and urge others to do the same.  Needless to say, I will not be purchasing 
 This was my first time reading Kellerman and I'm not sure if I'd ever pick up another book by him.  
 This book has a volume number - it is one of a series of monographs that have been published.  I am looking volume 231, but since you don't mention the volume number I don't know if this is the volume I'm seeking.  I will go elsewhere for my purchase 
 This book was terrible.  The women in it are not anymore powerful than in traditional fairy tales (and they are involved with both attempted rape and domestic violence because they pick the wrong guys--they are sooo powerful because they kick men in the crotch to escape!).  Plus, it seems that it is ok to say that men who are ugly are not as good as men who are attractive--basically she is advocating being a sexist as long as it is not against women. She also seems to have missed the fact that lots of "negative" aspects of traditional fairy tales (esp wolves) serve an allegorical purpose and taking them all so literally only makes her new stories very dull and wooden as she tries so hard to correct thses "mistakes".  Please, please read Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters by Kathleen Ragan instead--far and above the best book with strong female heroines in a fairy tale/folktale setting! 
 Scholinski attempts to attack the mental health field in her memoir "The Last Time I Wore a Dress." She asserts that she was held through her teenage years because she was not feminine enough in the eyes of idiot doctors. However, I found little evidence of her tomboy nature contributing to her hospitalization. Scholinski never considers the consequences of her actions, she is dishonest, histrionic, and self-absorbed. It is a lack of maturity, not femininity that causes Scholinski's downfall. Amazingly, Scholinski never sees her actions as having anything to do with the state of her existence. This short, simple, and repetitive novel is a memoir of denial 
 I READ MOST OF WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS WROTE AND I AGREED WITH THEM. THERE REALLY WAS NO DEPTH, BARELY ANY EMOTIONS, THE HERO IS SO VERY DULL. WHAT I DIDN'T GET WAS THE FACT THAT HE WENT AND KISSED THE HEROINE'S SISTER AND RESPONDED, WHAT'S WORSE WAS THAT, THAT PART WAS ONLY 67 PAGES TO THE END. HE DIDN'T REALLY ADMIT HE LOVE HIS WIFE UNTIL SHE ASKED HIM! AND HE REPLIED,   "AYE. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. I AM YOUR HUSBAND. HOW CAN YOU DOUBT IT?"  THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY EMOTION AS HE TALKED! BORING! I STILL CAN'T IMAGINE HE WENT AND KISSED SOMEONE ELSE AND FELT NO REMORSE OR GUILT. NO FEELINGS, PRATICALLY FOR WHAT HE DID!  ANOTHER PROBLEM, IS THAT HE SEEMED TO TAKE A LIKING TO THE HEROINE'S LITTLE BROTHER WAY TOO MUCH! IT'S ALMOST DISTURBING!  THE FACT THAT IN THE SEQUEL, CLEVE MENTIONED OF THE HERO'S LOVE FOR THE BOY MORE THAN THE WORLD AND PERHAPS HIS WIFE TOO. PREHAPS? I MEAN THAT IS EXTREMELY MESSED UP! '&'  I'M NOT GIVING THIS BOOK A TOTAL ZERO BECAUSE IT IS COULTER AFTER ALL. I STILL HAVE HOPE, HER OTHER BOOKS ARE BETTER.  
 This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory. There may be worthwhile ideas here hidden beneath layers of obscurantist prose, but the game did not seem worth the candle 
 The product is great, I already have the uni-lateral one and it rocks, so i wanted to buy the BI- Lateral aka 2.. and two times they have sent me UNI ones that were labeled as BI.. So your  best bet is to bi 2 uni's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem.. 
 I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time  
 The string screws are very loose and the strings won't stay tight. Though I know it is only a kid's guitar, it is pretty useless because the strings won't stay on. We bought two and both are the same way. Stay away from this 
 Entire book looks as if it's been photo-copied. Some pages have text cut off where the photocopy hasn't been done properly. Do not recommend buying this book 
  I was not all that crazy about Alanis's Jagged Little Pill when it was all the rage.  Then came Sheryl Crow's whinning about how "Everyday Is A Winding Road" and how her man done bring her "Anything But Down".  And Alanis's JLP album was  rendered a better listen than Crow's cry-baby singing.   I enjoyed Crow's "All I Wanna Do" and she, again suprised me with her doing of "The First Cut Is The Deepest" and I wish she would stay within those boundries in her singing because she is enjoyable that way.  
 I had great hopes for this book, but for any industry veteran it is basically a repackaging of what many other "experts" have written before.  The book is needlessly verbose, but yet glosses over key points with literary hand waving.  The lack of significant examples, business cases, and real world process development gives one the feeling the book is merely the presentation of a thesis or philosophy devoid of concrete real world application.  For someone just starting out in the industry they may glean some basic concepts, but there are so many more publications that do a better job and do it cleaner. 
 This book was a waste of money.  It's meant for beginners that aren't familiar with the terms and concepts of stock trading in general.  If you don't already know these terms or the basic concepts you shouldn't attempt to day trade.  If you do know these terms and concepts, then this book is a waste.  The day traders survival guide is a much better intro book and I highly recommend it over this one.  Other recommended trading books to start you off are High Probability Trading by Marcel Link and Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder 
 We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line 
 Saw "Hart's War" the other night and couldn't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one.  This film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days.   Here are ten reasons why:  1.  This film isn't "The Great Escape" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.    2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  "Hart's War" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets.  3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, "Hart's War" is pretty much on par with "Hogan's Heroes".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway?  4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in "Hart's War", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic.  5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous.  6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid.  7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't.  8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, "Hart's War" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes.  9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of "Die Hard" over and over and over again is tiring.  10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are "The Tuskeegee Airmen" and "Stalag 17".  Hopefully in a few years, "Hart's War" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill.   
 It's bad for learning, bad as reference, and not even close to addressing real C++ issues. "Author": If you put Templates as the last chaper to just mumble through it, stick to Visual Basic. Don't waste the reader's time. 
 This book was by far the WORST book I have ever read on techniques in orchestration.  The author is completely obsessed with his own works and his examples are meaningless and weak 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 Sorry Leslie - I used to enjoy your movies (Naked Gun series and Airplane especially), but this movie was horrible.  I kept watching it, in the expectation that it had to get better (funnier) at some point.  It never did.  You robbed me of 90 minutes of my life 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 ...and it's staring at you on the video cover.  It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene.  No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense.  It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy.  Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it.  But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her 
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 is heavily biased against the South. Yankees have been writing and rewriting southern history since 1865, with disastrous consequences for the truth.  From 1973-1982, he served as a Professor in the Department of History at City College and Graduate Center at City University of New York.  Foner earned his B.A., summa cum laude, from Columbia University in 1963, a second B.A. from Oriel College, Oxford, as a Kellett Fellow in 1965, and his Ph.D. in 1969, under the tutelage of Richard Hofstadter at Columbia.  Jack Foner was blacklisted in colleges and universities in the United States for nearly 30 years after declining to discuss his political preferences with a government committee.  One with such biased views of the South cannot write an objective history of Reconstruction 
 I had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the "F61" many people have seen. I calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that Panasonic sent them could fix the unit.  To this date, I still can't get Panasonic to send me a refurbished unit.  On top of that, I had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop.  I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty 
 Despite its appealing title, cover, and organization, this book is nothing more than an Ayurvedic "Helpful Hints from Heloise." I was hoping for something with more depth, not tips (some so silly as "Keep a pitcher of herb tea or sparkling mineral water in the fridge") on how to cram more into an already hectic life. 
 Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by "Ouida", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Rame, 1839-1908.  ISBN: 0192823280 
 The Index in the back of this book is incorrect.  The author and publisher are aware of this...I contacted each and they confirmed this.  Thus this book is worthless for anyone who wants to look things up....it should be taken off the market and corrected 
 I can confirm that the cartridges shipped with this photo value pack have a fraction of the ink capacity of normal cartridges. While there is nothing at all that indicates this in any of HP's marketing materials (bad HP) it becomes clear when you install them. The ink level gauges on the printer show much smaller bars for these than the regular cartridges - and indeed they do run out very quickly compared to normal cartridges.   Face it - HP is all about making very large profit margins from selling ink, and they aren't dumb.  If you want to buy an ink combo pack of full cartridges you can search amazon for HEWLETT PACKARD 02 COMBO PACK - you will find this listed as of today at $60 and not that much of a discount vs. buying single cartridges. 
 I can't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review. We have 10m twins, and have been using the stroller for about 4-5 months. It's terrible.  PROBLEMS:   1. NO SUN PROTECTION. the visors are locked in place. Unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back, it will be beating in your babies' eyes, and you'll need to buy a non-Peg Perego sunshade accessory. 2. HARD TO STEER. It gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt. If the sidewalk buckles just an inch (common from tree roots), the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks. It's hard to steer in a straight line, so it's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks.  3. IT'S FLIMSY. The bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use. It now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it. The cupholder broke during the first week. 4. HARD TO UNFOLD. It takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position. Don't even THINK about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands: you need both hands free to deal with this thing. 5. BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The stroller comes with no weight/height/age  suggestions. When we first tried to put our twins in it, they were swimming in it, and couldn't be upright. When we called Peg Perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely, the support rep said " don't know."   Yes it's lightweight and folds up nicely. But the light weight is actually a drawback; it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly -- resulting in a stroller that's difficult to steer.   My advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers. Even if you aren't an active parent -- I'm not -- get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand, dirt, and grass that you will encounter.  If stroller size is the most important factor to you, look at "stadium seating" strollers. 
 I have read all the books in the Midnite Louie series, and this one was definitely my least favorite.  Maybe because I was never an Elvis fan, but I just didn't find all the Elvis trivia and impersonator stuff interesting. Like several other readers, finishing the book was a chore, not really a pleasure like usual. I hope the next book gets back on track 
 I was intrigued by the title of this book, since I come into contact with all sorts of dogs regularly and am often asked advice about issues like possession guarding, dog-on-dog aggression, etc. However, the advice in this book is by no means anything I would ever pass on. Most issues are dealt with by correcting the dog harshly, shaking him, dragging him by the leash, and similar awful methods. The author's 'cure' for a dog that growls and snaps from under the bed is to daftly drag him out by the lead, and if he happens to bang his head on the way out, so much the better! She advises owners of dogs with fear aggression towards strangers to severly reprimand the dog with voice and leash corrections every time he becomes agitated around another person. This is a ridiculous way to 'help' your dog and will most likely only make the aversion worse. I noticed that Ms. Benjamin has also written a book that claims to use positive training methods, but unless her philosophy has changed from one book to the other, I would not recommend any of her material to anyone else. There are plenty of truly humane training guides out there, don't waste your money on this 
 i remember purchasing this album back in late 2001 a few months after it came out. i bought it completely for the beats and to hear some LOX. swizz beats does an awesome job on this one as well as dr dre on his two songs. "gangsta b's", the two singles, "that's how it is" and "cowboy" have great beats and should be blasted at high volume levels. however, eve is clearly not as great as people proclaim her to be. hands down she was outshined by da brat on her track "gangsta b's" (and most other female as well as male mc's can't mess with brat) but the shock of the hour was that trina had better more clever lyrics than eve. on trina's first album, i said she was the worst female lyricist of all time but eve had the predictable lines. neither is eve cute at all, far from it. on "who's that girl" and "cowboy" she shows some promise but she falls victim to rhyming "b!@&h" with the "s" word which has never ever rhymed before yet rappers still use it. "you had me" she has some dull rhymes and an annoying "nanana" in the chorus. "that's how it is" shows that styles p can quickly steal the show from eve. same old rhyming on "scream RR" and "life's so hard". well the way things are looking maybe she can marry 50 cent and dabble in poor lyrics together 
 I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially "I Will Fear No Evil" and "Time Enough for Love." I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with "Job"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty 
 I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.   I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you.  
 The basic premise of this book is that women are manipulative creatures who should only be interested in cooking, sex for their husbands, taking care of children, and keeping all negative thoughts to themselves.  I thought that I was missing something from this book, so I gave it to my husband to read.  He was actually insulted that Dr. Laura called him "simple," and thought that the book was way off the mark.  Only buy this book if you are also willing to get a lobotomy so that you can become a Stepford Wife, too 
 This is not a necessity for devout fans of Sylvia Browne. The pictures are nice and it is quite short. The main message I got out of it is that "they" can see us better by candlelight 
 I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened.  I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff 
 I ordered this for a friend, thinking it was the same Bruce Fisher book I bought when I divorced.  It is ONLY the workbook and really needs a workshop (or maybe just a book) to go with it.  It was a total waste of money and not what I expected when I ordered.  Make sure you are ordering the book, not the workbook, when you order 
 This product is not for the heavy handed  after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'. on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types 
 I listened to this book on tape during a long car trip. Instead of offering real vocational advice, as the title seemed to promise, all it presented was a series of biographical sketches and interviews with high-powered people who changed careers. That's inspirational as far as that goes, but it doesn't really provide any useful information that the individual reader could apply to his own life 
 It only requires 2 words to describe the movie. "ABSOLUTE CRAP" 
 The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.   Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made.  
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week....  There may be a device out there that will someday "revolutionize my workflow", but this isnt it, Back it goes... 
 I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate) 
 This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat.  The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader.  If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel.  If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you.  Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written 
 There are several problems that I had with this book.  First, it is basically an audio book with charts.  In some ways, it is nice to hear an explanation while seeing it on a chart, but if you are used to learning  from textbooks, then this book/CD is a nightmare.  The written text offers  nothing additional to the audio, and the CD has problems (sometimes it  would lose audio for spans of time, and these gaps were not filled in by  the text).  It is also extremely basic, to the point that all the  information is found easily and presented just as clearly on the internet,  for example on about.com.  Also, due to the audio nature of the book, you  can't really control the pace or skip through basic pages like you can with  a regular book.  The book was OK, considering that it was an overview; but  considering that you can get the same information for free, I would not  bother with it and would just skip to a more comprehensive text, such as  Technical Analysis of Financial Markets by Murphy 
 I purchased this DVD hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them.  While the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming, overfishing, etc., most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives.  The imagery was beautiful when they were under the water, but it's only a small percentage of film.  Very disappointing 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 Yes, there are worthwhile portions of this book, such as the author's dissection of some of the idiocies of "free market capitalism" and the "children of Abraham." Nevertheless, the book could have been so much better.  First, I must heartily agree with those who have criticized the book's poor organization. Where was/were the editor(s)?  Second, the book does go on at unnecessary length about Princess Diana. Furthermore, although Wheen is certainly aware of "Mother Teresa," who died days after Princess Diana, he gives Ma T (who is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the most over-rated public figures of the 20th century) no more than a passing mention. Now Ma T is a subject ripe for the sort of treatment the author gives to Princess Diana. However, not a word about Ma T's grotesque warehouses of the sick and dying, not a word about the vast sums of money and other contributions collected by her organizations that were obviously not actually used, and not a word about her perverse ideas on suffering, for example: "I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people."  Third, although Wheen does deal to some extent with the anti-scientific fraud of Creationism (he doesn't give it enough attention, in my opinion), he does not deal with the "Shroud of Turin".  Fourth, the relatively few pages on "right-wing conspiracy theories" seem like lip service. There is so much more that he could have mentioned. He could have mentioned that the Birchers still would have us believe that President Ike was a "conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy." He could have mentioned the persistent efforts to (ahem) whitewash slavery (part of the heinous liberal plot to defame the white, Christian South). Recently, one of those efforts, the booklet "Southern Slavery as it Was" found itself into classes at Cary Christian School in Cary, NC. He could have mentioned the ongoing attempts to promote the obvious lie that large numbers of Americans were being held prisoner by Vietnam for years after the return of the POWs, and that there was an elaborate government coverup to hide the existence of these prisoners. You can still find assertions that there are still US prisoners in Vietnam. He could have mentioned those things and many others, but he did not.  Finally, he seems afflicted with the "Must Have BALANCE!" disease that crops up in so many pundits. Hence the section devoted to the crimes of various (gasp) heinous leftoids. Much of this section verges on being outright ridiculous. For example, he goes into high dudgeon over the dastardly anti-Americanism of Noam Chomsky, who, among other crimes, was insufficiently critical of the Khmer Rouge. Wheen conveniently fails to mention that the US government, for no discernible reason than to spite the government of Vietnam, *who were the ones who overthrew the Khmer Rouge*, "...became tacit supporters, for nearly a decade, of the Khmer Rouge, despite their murderous regime. The United States government continued to recognize the ousted regime as the legitimate occupants of Cambodia's seat in the United Nations" (Arnold R. Isaacs in _Vietnam Shadows_). Most of that period occurred during *Republican* governments in the US, but it wouldn't be convenient to acknowledge that. Wheen also gets self-righteous about something Michael Moore (a favorite whipping boy of American Fascists and their useful idiots) wrote that is obviously a comment on the savagely murderous absence of any sort of selectivity in (...)choice of targets. Wheen conveniently neglects to mention that Ann Coulter openly expressed the wish that the planes had hit the New York Times. Coulter has also openly advocated the persecution of "liberals". In fact, *far* more prevalent and dangerous than any heinous leftoids are the legions of poison-pen and poison-tongue right-wing propagandists, backed by vast amounts of right-wing money, who constantly dump their raw sewage into American society. No, it wouldn't do at all to acknowledge that particular unpleasant truth about "life in these United States." This books's glaring faults significantly outweigh its small virtues, in my opinion 
 I bought one of these and returned it a couple days later (from an electronics store - much more expensive than @ Amazon).  While it had many qualities I was looking for, like the thick, protected connector for the ipod instead of a dangling wire, this unit just didn't do a good job of holding a charge.  I followed all the instructions, charge it overnight, etc. but still it would only give and extra hour or so battery life to my 40 gig ipod.  As tempting as this one is, I'd say pass and find one with proven ability to hold a charge 
 I kept watching this hoping a plot would eventually come up. But it didnt . 
 Unfortunately as the subject holds great importance,  this tome is an example of the tedium typical of academic writing. A subject of monumental signifance is treated withe the dullness of an old and dusty library stack. Will serve as a perfect soporific. Sad and sorry 
 Don't buy this fan, unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed.  Also, if it has green lights(like my blizzard fan did), it will light up a dark room at night. Also, you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling.  Low speed is quiet enough for sleeping, but high will disturb you. The angle tilt adjustments are not precise, and are difficult to do.  There are better choices 
 Although I truly enjoy Louie Prima's music, this DVD does not due him justice.  The sound and picture quality is poor. The performances are old and all in BLACK & WHITE!! The only parts in color are the commentary and the cemetary photo where he is buried.  Better to just buy a CD and listen to him perform. This DVD is way overpriced for its poor quality. I do not recommend unless you just want anything and everything there is available on Louie Prima, no matter what the quality is like. I was very disappointed 
 I recently purchased this book, trusting the recommendations on this site, and after reviewing the book I am sorely disappointed. The book doesn't give a tremendous amount of information in individual essential oils, it dedicates nearly three times the amount of pages to Dr. Young's exclusive blends, and how to use them. Additionally a lot of content is dedicated to telling you why every other oil is inferior to the Dr. Young oils, which came across as nothing more than a marketing ploy to sell his oils. I've used other oils, such as John Steele oils - which are EXCELLENT quality - and have had no negative effects from it.  Another thing I found quite alarming is his recommendation to use essential oils neat, including ones known to be irritating or caustic to the skin. The "Raindrop technique" is extensively discussed which any respectable aromatherapist knows is incredibly hazardous and likely to cause burning or injury to the skin.  There is some generally good information given about individual oils, like the range of which chemicals should be in each oil, however, nowhere does he explain what each of these components do, and no where does he talk about how these various components act on the brain chemistry. He also doesn't explain how various oils can counteract each other in the brain chemistry through inhalation, something critical if EO's are to be used in mood alteration, altering brain function or the like.  If you plan on using the Young Living oils, then this book would be of great help, but if you don't, I think the book is mostly advertising for his oil line and won't be of much use to you 
 This should be called America in Beer. Smith overrates the importance beer played in the dramatic events of US history. His thesis that beer played an  everyday part in Colonial life is well-taken, if a bit obvious. More  interesting is his history of the brewing industry, and discussion of  historical brewing literature. He should have concentrated on these, and  placed beer and brewing into a context of technological and cultural  change, and ignored political context except as it specifically concerned  alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, Smith's history knowledge rarely  transcends the mundane textbook level -- and even that is outdated, relying  all too often on analyses and interpretations that are decades old, and  have long been superseded. Still, since there is no other book on the  subject, and it is easy, even enjoyable reading (especially the fictional intros to each chapter -- I love those), it is an important work 
 Mr. Bloxham does not take into account the effects of the Armenian Revolt, which lasted from the 1890s to 1920. Armenian revolutionary groups, the Hinchaks and Dashnaks, launched a campaign of terror against Ottoman officials and citizens. They began killing Muslims 20 years before the Armenian deportations took place in 1915. Also, from 1915 to 1920, Armenian soldiers, rebels and gangs massacred a half-million Turks, Kurds and Azeris. If we are willing to call what happened to the Armenians a genocide, then what do we call what the Armenians did to the Muslims?   Anyone who seeks to learn about the Armenian/Ottoman tragedy should start with a book published in 1964 by the Armenian scholar, Louise Nalbandian: "Armenian Revolutionary Movements." She wrote her book shortly before the Armenian Diaspora began to politicize their claims to genocide. It doesn't matter to me whether a person believes the Armenians were victims of genocide in 1915. What matters to me is that "academics" such as Mr. Bloxham insist on discussing only one side of this tragic story, and continue to pretend that Armenians did no wrong.  Horrible atrocities were committed on all sides; it is the responsibility of Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to deal with this legacy. In the U.S. and Europe, this issue has become too politicized. Anyone who disagrees with the Armenian viewpoint is automatically labeled a "genocide denier." Unfortunately, most of the media and politicians have naively chosen to support the Armenian genocide claims without conducting their own research. And they choose to believe that "scholars" such as Mr. Bloxham are basing their writings on thorough research that takes the Armenian revolutionary movement into account; such is not the case 
 I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way 
 When my husband developed acid reflux, it was recommended that he lower his carb intake. As long time lacto vegetarians (no fish, meat or eggs, yes to dairy), this sounded particularly challenging.  I bought 3 different low carb cookbooks from Amazon a month ago: "Low-carb Vegetarian" by Celia Brooks Brown, "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson and "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook: 80 Delicious Vegetarian and Vegan Recipes Made Easy with the Glycemic Index" by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller   After a month of consistent cooking I have rarely used Brown's "Low-carb Vegetarian" which is laden with ~50% recipes that use eggs.  There are some great recipes in there if you eat eggs though.  On the other hand, my copy of "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson is a bit dog-eared already.  Delicious, innovative recipes with new ways to use foods common to the vegetarian and wonderful exploring of unusual but easily available new veggies and protein options.  "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook"  by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller was rich with information and great recipes.  It taught me a lot.   But by far Robertson's "Carb Conscious Vegetarian" is the best.  I will say that I don't know either of these authors and am doing this to help a buyer who may be wondering which one to get...  By the way, a low carb/lower acid diet has really eased the acid reflux my husband suffers from. We eat a main meal during the day and a protein drink at night, even if working: switched when consuming. And I am starting to lose weight...  Hope this helps!        
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 Another in the long line of promosexual strongarming from the left. far-far left. I cannot remember ever reading something this boorish.  Avoid it please 
 This movie is ok in its way, howver, those connected with it obviously have no concept of the meaning of honnor or duty and, if they have ever bothered to read the original romance understood nothing. Tristan in this version is spitefull, self-centered and mean spirited. He blames Isolde for the failure of his relationship and forces her to betray her husband, and the man who cared for him a a child. The mythical Tristan was a man of great honor and integrity, who put honor, loyalty and duty above all else. He did not betray his lord or his friends. King Mark of Cornwall in the legend wrongly suspected the couple of an illicit affair. Incidentally, the makers of this movie also call Tristan 'Traistan of Aragon' which is in Spain. He was actually from Lyonesse, which now lies beneath the English Channel 
 This book was used in part, for a class on the in Classics on the Age of Homer.  This book describes early Greek life and culture in depth, yet at the same time seemed to be way over my head.  The text is very longwinded and confusing for someone who has not met the material before, and would not recommend it as a book to read in your pasttime.  Rather, the book is very thorough, and would make for great refernce material, giving an in depth perspective to  early Greek culture 
 well my 5 year old wanted this doll sooooo bad for christmas. this was the only thing she asked santa for. the commercials for this doll were great. i dont know if it is because she is missing her front teeth that the doll does not recognise her or if it just dont work period. but my daughter has cried and cried because this doll does not recognise her. i have reset the doll 6 times but it still does not work the way it is supposed to. every time she talks to the doll it says your not my mommy and she goes into tears or it has her to say its name over and over until she does not want to play with it. i am a single mom and i could barely afford to pay 100 dollars for a doll for her.espesially when her expectations for this doll were so high. i wish someone had written on here the truth about this doll before i bought it, then my daughter would not be so dissapointed 
 HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WILL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVIC 
 While this book is very well written & has a plot that holds together well, I was very disappointed in its content as contrasted with what I anticipated based upon the jacket description. While I know you cannot judge a book by its cover, I was surprised to find this book was a tragedy of monumental proportions. As a sensitive person, it left me depressed in the extreme. In the end, the heroine is left with nothing and no one (except a maid), but her revelation about God's "love" ("his/her" love??? - how can that be when there is so much hopelessness & suffering!) is supposed to be enough to sustain her through the rest of her old age & life. The poor illuminator Finn gets a granddaughter, but he is such a broken man at the end that I didn't believe he would be around to raise her for very long. And Kathryn finding comfort in God after all the horrors of medieval society just seems repulsive to me. I believe jacket descriptions are getting way out of line lately, as this book was nothing more than a RELIGIOUS (RAH! RAH!)tome, cloaked in a medieval setting w/ romantic cover art. You better like religion & the teachings of God if you are thinking about reading this book. I didn't enjoy it, as there was nothing much to enjoy except the writing, since the plot was nothing short of a confirmation of the hopelessness & joylessness of much of human existence. (Thought the way the characters spoke seemed way too modern, inconsisent, & somewhat cheesy for my tastes too!). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they were searching for God's love & were already true believers in the wonderousness of religion 
 I was impressed by the writer's skill in creating beautiful prose. However, I did not get anything else out of the book. Forgettable characters, thin plot, endless descriptions, and ultimately dull.    Seemed like the writer was writing the book for himself and no one else. Rated two stars because of writer's talent and because I enjoyed the first half. Take three stars off for the meandering second half and my other complaints 
 The definitive book about Bill is "No One Left To Lie To", by Christopher Hitchens.  He knows how to take a scapel and wield it to reveal the core of a maggot. This book is way too soft 
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 The Executed God covers an important and controversial issue, but it did not rise to the task. I expected to be challenged by the author's approach, yet his methodology left me feeling ill used. Taylor's tone and presentation hindered his message. I found many of his arguments superficial for such a weighty subject. His use of Mumia Abu-Jamal echoed the cries of too many Hollywood elite. They know little of the facts of the case as available to criminal justice professionals, and they trust what Abu-Jamal says despite evidence and conflicts in his statements. Facts don't matter, only emotional responses. I expected more from a theologian and academic from Princeton. Instead, I felt as if I was reading propaganda. References to "gulag America," the "theatrics of terror," "big house nation," "lockdown America," and the like further confirmed this. I am well aware there are many injustices in our (and any) political system, and I am open to the possibile abolition of the death penalty. Yet, his use of these terms and method of argument make me suspect the merit and academic value of his work. I wanted a thoughtful, challenging examination of the issue. Instead, I got annoid 
 I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 First of all, let me say that "Billy Budd" is an awful book that should have never been disinterred and published. I think I've never read a dumber and flatter novella before (and I'm an avid classic reader). It's quite baffling to think that this drivel was written by the same man who created the fascinating universe of "Moby Dick". I find it very surprising that anybody could deem such a poor book apt for publication, but even more unacceptable is that this monumental exercise in boredom and pompous writing can be considered a "classic" nowadays; something that, on the other hand, shouldn't surprise us if we take into account that other really appalling books such as "The Red Badge of Courage" or "As I Lay Dying" (to mention only two) are widely read in colleges and high-schools. As far as I'm aware, it is obvious that the critical eye must be blind or must have been poked out a long time ago.  Basically, "Billy Budd" is the story of a simpleton who is transferred from a merchant to a war ship due to political circumstances. The boy is handsome but dumb and he is unable to protect himself from the evil accusations of a miserable and envious shipmate (Claggart). As Budd is so dim that he almost can't even talk, he ends up killing the accusing man in front of the ship captain (a very intelligent thing to do), so that he is put to trial and finally hanged. End of story. What remains in between is one of the most pedantic and pointless writing in the History of American literature. We don't even get to know why Claggart was envious of Billy as the narrative is so disperse, absurd and unfocused that there's no way to elucidate for sure the reasons of everything. In short, the story is a complete waste of your reading time which resembles a first draft instead of a fully realized work. It is not that this book is overrated (which certainly is), it's just that it is BAD on a literary level. A book utterly devoid of coherent and plausible ideas. I pity the poor people (mostly students all around the world) who are forced to read this. It will give them nightmares.  Herman Melville is regarded by many critics as the best American writer of all time, but, what they don't recognise is that, actually, Melville is, objectively, a literary "bluff" who, excepting "Moby Dick" and the two short stories "Bartleby" and "The Lighting-Rod Man", never wrote anything really worthy (his collection of mediocre novels after "Moby Dick" is legendary), being "Billy Budd" quite possibly the worst piece of work of all his career. Sometimes I get the impression that, the more verbose a book is, the better work of art is considered (and stories by people like James Joyce, Henry James or Melville himself are the living proof of that). Apparently, that a writer can be able to express complicated concepts in an understandable way doesn't have merit at all or it isn't trendy enough to those who try not to see that the Emperor is usually (or tends to be) stark naked.  To finish, I would recommend you to avoid this "Billy Dull" like death, and read something worth your time. But, if on the contrary things like idiotic characters, nonsensical situations and a practically inexistent plot constitute your idea of great literature, then so be it, as this may be your book, and I respect that. After all, I suppose every book needs a fan. What do you think?. 
 I like this author, but this story falls apart under the weight of a not too well thought out mystery. Plus the characters are so diverse it seems impossible that they would be in the same story, and have no conflict 
 If you know absolutely nothing about DCC, this is an expensive way to start - you will be better served by buying a different book.  Kalbach Publishing have failed miserably with this one - it never hits its mark and is useless as an independant guide - contains almost no information.  Cannot recommend 
 This book is full of poorly written essays backed only by the authors' direct ties to the beat generation.    Instead, buy this book ("Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript, and Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author..."), which is cheaper and very very interesting to those fascinated by Howl and Ginsberg, or even just the poetic process.  "Howl Fifty years later" was a great disapointment for me. 
 Our library has just finished its magazine usage count, and to my surprise the American Spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits, measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues. And yet our patronage here is very conservative. Perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all, or maybe, as a couple of reviewers suggested, with Bill Clinton out of office, it no longer has the same appeal.  You can change my rating to five stars if you like, for the sake of ideology, but you still won't read the thing. Just like I don't read the Nation anymore 
 This was a book that discussed art, and tried too hard to be a work of art itself.  Most of the characters were flat and unlikable.  The author takes us into three time periods, one melodramatic (the life of Chatterton), one boring (the life of Wallace), and one surreal (the life of Wychwood).  On the positive, I did learn more about Chatterton, and had more of a feel for what it would have been like to feel the way Romantics felt.  But all in all, I couldn't wait for this book to be over. 
 This is the over-hyped story of two industries, the tobacco companies and the plaintiff lawyers that achieved little or nothing for their clients or society.  A charming combination that should have been ignored rather than sanctified. This book would have us believe that an industry which is the equivalent of I.G. Farben, was taken down by what the author paints as a southern homeboy and his merry band of legal groupies.  Perhaps they drove a truth-telling microbus that only seemed to be Lear jet to the uninformed.  What actually occurred was the clash of two incredibly greedy groups, the tobacco comanies and their  lawyer-enemies.  Both are motivated by money, yet the lawyers's robe themselves in saintly virtue for their efforts.  The author appears to have believed that Ness, Motley would have fought this battle even they weren't paid, which seems unlikely.  What did they really achieve -- Nothing. The tobacco companies merely rasied their prices to pay Ness Motley for the settlement. Did any smoker benefit -- NO. Was the tobacco industry brought to justice -- NO. Was any rational measure of Justice achieved -- NO.  Motley has nothing to be proud of. He and his firm are cut from the same cloth as Shook Hardy and Philip Morris. The exploiters alway have alot in commom--shame and corruption. Don't waste you money on this book, and skip the inevitable movie as wellor rent Triumph of the Will instead 
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble 
 This is a blatant commercial overture, as tonight and this, both tried to recapture Lets Dance popularity.  The songs, are not so bad.  The commercial texture and deliver, is horrific.  As if Bowie envisioned a tour with Chaka Kahn and Madonna, when that age was already over.  Postpunk was already being pasteurized as 'alternative' for the masses.  So Bowie was outdated by something he inspired himself just 10 years earlier.  But what from Bowie wasnt a commercial attempt?  To say he was vanguard and underground before Lets Dance is incorrect.  Only his Berlin Trio- low/heroes/lodger, was left field.  He was very popular in the 70s.  People forget this now bc he was so original.  Lets Dance, which was about when he came to my pre-teen attention, was a brilliant 80s album.  It was popular and so he was crucified for later works.  The album cover does not help either.  It looks like he is trying to make an innocuous hit that housewives, college kids, and teenagers will all buy with the Zany Writing and colors! and look he has Baggy Pants on 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 This book had some good ideas if it were 1970. It's very outdated. I'm sure it was a good book when it was still current, but in 2006, it's just a a waste of time and money. 
 The author makes some spectacular claims that would make a good Hollywood movie, but make for bad science. One of the most ridiculous accusations is the "Jewish" media purposely under reports the number of tornados ravaging the LA area. Another ...claim is Winston Churchill wanted to use Anthrax on Nazi Germany during WW II.    This book is very hard to stomach if the reader is looking for serious discussion on the topic of Ecology. The only reason I finished the book was to get a better understanding of how the environmentalist movement has been hijacked by radical elements 
 I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse 
 watching this film i felt i had seen it before . it follows the same teen movie cleshays that we know so well offering nothing new for this type of movie . saying that i've seen worse and fans of teen comedys will probable find it entertaining for the most part . the main reason i got this was that the talented Lacey Chabert is in it . acting in the type of film that she made fun of in not another teen movie . lacey does her best with the material and what little screen time she has but she is not aloud to show her true comic potenshal as she was in films like mean girls . in my opinion this film is not bad it's just very avarge .  thank you for reading my review  
 This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks.  This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one.  A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel.  As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference.  [... 
 Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting 
 A good tech book has no fluff or filler, makes it easy to see and reference the major points and principles, and has solid unambiguous examples.  This book disappoints on all three counts.  This book has a lot of padding: it spends a lot of time repeating what it already said or prefacing what it will say next, or using an entire paragraph to say what a single clear sentence would.  The principles and major points are then buried in that muck instead of being clearly stated and highlighted.  On the bright side, chapter 7 (Query Language) had plenty of nice examples 
 I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated "beeping" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take. 
 I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase.  However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check.  I was astonished.  I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.  With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item.  If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.  But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice.  
 I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense 
 Low quality, and poor product support from Creative.  Very disappointed with this product.  It worked for about 6 months of light use, then quit working (turned off or wouldn't turn on at all).  Creative tech support recommended downloading new driver, but this didn't help.  So I was going to send it in because it is still under warranty.  However, they require a non-refundable $25 "diagnostic and handling" fee just to send it in (plus I pay shipping), and there may or may not be additional charges for labor.  This doesn't make sense given the value of the player, so the warranty is basically useless.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and they suggested that next time I buy their enhanced warranty.  I think next time I probably just won't buy a Creative product.  
 In the wake of The Phantom Menace, I was very forgiving.  I honestly just figured it was a sluggish opening to what was sure to be a fantastic set of films.  Sure Obi-Wan had only a supporting role, while Anakin himself barely had that.  They were just setting the stage for the real show.  When I saw ads and trailers for Attack of the Clones, I was sure this was the Star Wars prequel I was really waiting for.  Anakin Skywalker would no longer be some little kid and he would at last take the center stage as a young, lightsaber-brandishing Jedi hotshot.  All the things I used to love to hear about in the old movies, like what a great warrior he was, how he and Obi-Wan Kenobi were the best of friends, and all the grand adventures they had together, all before Anakin's tragic fall to the Dark Side of the Force, would finally be shown, and it would be fantastic.  Boy was I wrong...  By now we've all heard the same criticisms for this film.  The acting is poor, the dialogue is bad, etc, etc...  Those are all very valid arguments of course, and they are enough to hurt any movie.  What really turned me against this film, however, is the simple fact that Anakin Skywalker has turned out to be the single most unlikable "hero" I've ever seen in a major motion picture.  Far from the good person we were told about in the original trilogy, the Anakin we see here is incredibly obnoxious.  He gripes and throws tantrums, usually when his ego is not pandered to, he can't hold his own in a fight, and worst of all, he clearly hates Obi-Wan Kenobi's guts.  So what's Anakin's problem?  Why is he such a crab?  In the movie, Obi-Wan claims that Anakin's abilities have made him arrogant, hence his foul attitude.  Some of the other Jedi also comment about how Anakin has such "exceptional abilities" for his age, and Anakin struts about as if he's owed something for his talents.  Apparently his amazing Jedi powers have lead to our hero to having a bit of a swelled head.  That all sounds very interesting at first, but you can imagine my confusion when every single battle in which Anakin participates involves him getting clobbered.  Indeed, with the exception of a minor scuffle towards the beginning of the movie, all the fights in which Anakin is involved end with either him surrendering at gunpoint or with him just flat out getting his butt kicked.  My favorite example of this is how the climactic lightsaber duel with Count Dooku wraps up with our dashing young hero being shoved over by an eighty-year-old man.  Am I really expected to believe this is the cunning warrior we were told about in the original films?  And more importantly, how can I believe this wimp is the future Darth Vader?  So why the slew of losses for our hero?  It seems like the primary theory is that, like The Empire Strikes Back, since this is the middle portion of a trilogy, the good guys need to get kicked around a bit by the bad guys.  As part of the journey for a hero, Anakin is apparently supposed to "suffer his first defeats" at the hands of his adversaries as he grows as a character.  Just like Luke, right?  Now I'm as much of a fan of the Hero's Journey as anyone.  That's why I love the original Star Wars Trilogy so much, and I'm sure many of my fellow fans out there are the same.  But the real question now is, since this trilogy is going to end on such a dark note, why make our hero suffer so many superfluous defeats halfway through?  Isn't his turn to evil at the end of this new set of films enough of a failure for him to suffer through?  And what major victories has Anakin experienced in the past to justify his multiple defeats now?  If anything, this should have been the movie in which Anakin experiences his biggest and brightest successes.  That way, when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, it really would be a terrible loss and tragedy.  Unfortunately, this movie just tries to imitate the formula of the original trilogy by having the middle installment feature the heroes getting their butts kicked a lot, making the fatal mistake of forgetting that the heroes are already doomed to fail at the end of this whole trilogy.  By the time Anakin actually does turn to evil at the end of the third movie, it's just a great big, "so what?"  So much time is made pointing out that Anakin has some latent evil lurking within him or that he's more of a failure than a hero, his turn to the Dark Side is really nothing special.  Who cares what happens to him?  Anakin didn't fall from grace by the time Revenge of the Sith came around, because there was no grace to fall from in the first place, thanks to this movie.  We were promised a hero, and we got a punk.  That's why I despise this particular chapter so.  When Anakin isn't busy getting knocked around by bad guys or lusting after Padme, the rest of his time is spent grumbling about how much he resents his mentor, Obi-Wan.  At best, Anakin harbors a grudging respect for his master, but it doesn't go much further than that.  Instead, it's made pretty clear that Anakin does not think very highly of Obi-Wan, and he rails on and on about how unpleasant it is being under his tutelage.  At one point Anakin actually accuses Obi-Wan of keeping him from his full potential.  Obi-Wan himself is not so innocent either.  Nothing like the kindly old wizard from the original films, the Obi-Wan here is very snide and has a tendency of rolling his eyes while making sarcastic comments at Anakin's deeds.  Keep in mind this is not just harmless banter when these two start in on each other, this is genuine hostility.  Anakin even refuses to go help Obi-Wan when he gets word that he has been captured by some of the villains.  Only after Padme twists Anakin's arm into going does he make any effort to help his teacher.  These two characters don't look like good friends to me.  In fact, these guys don't seem to like each other at all.  It's really disappointing, because the original films made such a great setup by weaving tales about what a great guy Anakin was, and how he was such a good friend.  Having our two heroes despise each other now totally undermines any drama when they clash at the trilogy's finale.  There's just no reason to care about the death of their friendship now, because this movie killed it before it could even begin.  Not only that, but it totally blows off what Obi-Wan stated about their friendship in the old movies.  Anakin was supposed to be the antithesis of Darth Vader; a good, decent person who was a warm friend and a boon to the Republic.  Now, he just seems to be nothing more than a watered down version of the monster he's destined to become.  It's like George Lucas is congratulating himself for making such a legendary villain in the original trilogy by dropping these little "hints" here and there pointing out the fact that Darth Vader's creation is just around the corner, as if that was something glorious.  What I really don't understand is what purpose all this animosity serves.  It seems like it's supposed to be foreshadowing to their big brawl at the end of the series, but why foreshadow when everyone in the civilized world has known Anakin Skywalker is going to turn against his mentor for more than twenty years?  Wouldn't have setting up a real sense of camaraderie between these two now have made their battle at the end of the next chapter much more tragic and poignant?  Besides, when Revenge of the Sith finally came out, the blistering contempt these two characters clearly harbor for each other in this chapter doesn't even play any kind of a role when Anakin makes his turn to evil.  All the vicious accusations Anakin makes about Obi-Wan holding him back or being too hard on him in his teachings are all just cast aside and contribute absolutely nothing to his decision to turn to the Dark Side.  In fact, it's all forgotten and treated as if it never happened.  Instead, by the time Episode III comes around, we just get a bunch of baloney about how love is somehow the key to the Dark Side (even though it's been established that hatred and anger are the elements of this forbidden power) and Anakin's care for his beloved Padme was the reason for his downfall.  Meanwhile, our two heroes gushed about what a great time they had together as master and apprentice and what good friends they are, despite the fact that this movie was all about showing how volatile their relationship was.  It's a tremendous blow to the continuity of the series, and I get into more so in my review of Revenge of the Sith.  So I ask, what is the point of all their bickering in this movie?  Aside from reminding the whole world about Anakin and Obi-Wan's showdown even though it's already known about it for nearly three decades now, and essentially treating the audience like complete morons, I'm yet to come up with an answer for that question.  Just as we only hear of how Anakin is such a powerful warrior while simultaneously seeing him get beaten over and over again, we only hear of how Anakin and Obi-Wan are friends, while much of their interactions we actually see in the movie involve them arguing or criticizing each other.  Having characters just talk about something in a movie doesn't make it so.  For heaven's sake, movies are supposed to be about showing a story visually, with images on the screen!  It can't just be chatted about!  This movie might as well have been two hours of George Lucas sitting in a comfy chair, reading the script aloud.  That makes about as much sense as what we ended up with.  If something as important as Anakin's skills as a warrior or his friendship with his mentor are just talked about, it doesn't carry any weight compared to what's shown on the screen, especially when all we see is the exact opposite.  Now let me see if I've got all this straight.  Here we have our protagonist Anakin Skywalker:  He gripes and moans about what a jerk his master Obi-Wan is, yet I'm supposed to believe they're close friends.  He boasts and brags about being a super-powerful, prodigal Jedi, yet it seems all it takes to best him is a handful of rickety battle droids.  All this, and I'm expected to be rooting for this chump?  I don't know what George Lucas was thinking when he wrote the script for this movie, but where I come from, one and one does not make three.  Despite all of this, many a movie-goer and Star Wars fan have slathered this movie with heaps of praise.  Most of the positive things I tend to hear about this movie primarily revolve around the delight at finding out where the Storm Troopers and Boba Fett come from, or seeing the brief reference to the creation of the Death Star, or most wondrous of all, we get to see Yoda get into a lightsaber fight.  Well, all this nerdy Star Wars trivia is fine and dandy, but you know something?  When I watch a movie and the main character is this utterly loathsome, then to put it bluntly, I don't really give a damn about anything else that happens 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 I wouldn't even give this toy a 1 start rating......we bought it for our kids for Easter and it hasn't blown one bubble for us....first the tubes were pinched off so we fixed it, no bubbles.....so we cleaned it per the instruction manual,STILL no bubbles!!! I have however poured bubbles over the feeder area and got lots of bubbles that way......but to use it the way its meant we haven't had any luck!!! What a disappointment!! 
 I did a little calculating and I figure that if they sell all 20,000 (LIMITED EDITION??) of these for $40,000 each, they make $800 million.  But, the free shipping is killing them. IF they only charged $10,000 shipping, they could make a billion dollars on this book 
 The title of the book would better describe the content if it had been "Random Battles with References to Intelligence." I would not have sold as well, but justly so. From the title you'd expect to learn about how intelligence affects the course of war. Not the case here.  The book focus on haphazzardly selected battles without sufficent greater context to the larger conflict. Covering Midway was a good idea. Not covering the outlook of the Pacific War prior to and after the battle in contrast is disappointing.  The book is at times a stimulant and at others a sleep aid. Keegan's description of the Battle of the Nile lasted four times as long as necessary, but provided enthralling reading occationally. His coverange of the Battle of Midway is pathetic. Far better narritives of this battle have been written, as have descriptions of cryptology's impact on the battle.  No, Mr. Keegan, intelligence (specifically cryptology) didn't win the batte. But cryptology allowed Nimitz a chance to win it. Can intelligence kill the enemy (the base objective of the military commander)? No, but it can tell him which direction to shoot.  If you want to learn about intelligence, don't waste your time on this book.  If you want to read about several random battles involving the English speaking world, don't waste your money on this book 
 As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better 
 This mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an OS setting.  Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across.  It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet. There is nothing original in this mag, ever. Also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier. All the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months. Don't believe me? Take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them.  The reviews are also weak. nearly every month you will see: THE FASTEST SYSTEM WE EVER TESTED!!!!! YAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNN. Who cares? Anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute, even for gamers. Besides, does it really matter that system y is .00005% faster on their poor testing system then computer z?  The second star is for Mr Halfhills column. It is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how.  Read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want, learn how to use search engines, and skip this pointless mag 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days. 
 Why is Danielle Steel so popular? This is the first of her books I read and it will be her last. Horrible writing: high school level 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 This book is the "standard" for providing straightforward code demonstrating various options pricing techniques, and perhaps deservedly so -- after all, it really doesn't have too many competitors in that niche. However, even in the course of the fairly straightforward applications I've had for this book (mostly simple equity Cox-Ross and Black-Scholes modeling), I've been shocked by the number of blatant mathematical errors (in the formulas for rho with distinct carry and risk-free rates, for instance). Clearly, the author and editors didn't bother to spend much time verifying that the formulas they cite are actually correct. (I'm actually shocked to see a fellow reviewer praise the "proofreading" -- I'm guessing he or she never actually had to use any of the formulas in this book!)    Bottom line -- if you're looking for a handy, compact reference of option pricing formulas, this is probably what you'll end up with. But be careful. It is SO frustrating to spend hours trying to figure out where you made a mistake in implementing one of these models, only to learn that you DIDN'T make a mistake -- the mistake was in your source. Consider yourself warned.. 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 In this book, Michael Moorcock, being of the breed of fantasy author who has tried so desperately to come off as a "real" writer because everyone looks at fantasy writers as juvenille hacks, discusses at length his windbag opinions about the current state of fantasy fiction as well as its past. The essays contained within this book are long-winded, pretentious rubbish that should be avoided by everyone except diehard Michael Moorcock fans. This guy has the gall to bash guys like Tolkien and Robert E.Howard, thinking he's some kind of literary genius because of his teen-fave Elric books that are supposed to be so deep and introspective but in reality are nothing more than over-worded, whiny drivel unpalatable by anyone over the age of 25. Spare us, Mr. Moorcock. The Elric books are the only half-decent thing you've ever written, and you've been riding on the fame you accrued from them ever since. Get over yourself. You're not that great a writer and a little modesty would do you a lot of good 
 Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it. 	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it.   
 After listening to and enjoying Charlaine Harris's Grave Sights on audiotape, I headed to my library to check out her other books.  I'd read good reviews here of the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, so I began with Dead Until Dark.  I must say that I found this book's prose stilted and the dialogue and plot somewhat juvenile.  I found Sookie and her vampire boyfriend, Bill to be shallow characters and the plot vapid compared to those of Harper Connelly and her brother, Tolliver in Grave Sights.  In the future, if I want to read about vampires I'll stick with Laurell Hamilton's edgy and well written Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novels.  
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!  The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.  The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.  The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  "How long can this go on without being funny," one asks oneself.  "Surely it will be funny next episode!"  Nothin' doin'.  If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a "funny skit" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.  And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug 
 Having read the book by William March many years ago and really liking it, I recently had the chance to see the film version again. It is obviously not as good as the book; in fact it is pretty terrible and laughable.  It's obvious that it's just an opened up stage play; it seems stiff and stilted and stagey; everyone seems to speak loudly as if trying to make their voices reach the upper balconies of a theater. Pretty badly acted all around but the worst is Nancy Kelly. She got an Oscar nomination for this?? All she does is scream or shout her lines in an increasingly hoarse voice and wrings her hands dramatically almost like a character in a Perils of Pauline movie. She is so laughably bad in every scene and her character is just about as stupid. Finally it takes a hammer to the head for her to figure out what's going on.  Patty McCormack and the usually excellent character actor Henry Jones are both pretty one-note in their performances. Enough said. But the saddest is to see the great Eileen Heckart overacting badly as a grieving drunk of a mother. Her histrionics make you want Rhoda to do away with her too. And the neighbor Monica...equally annoying. I kept waiting for Rhoda to shove her down the stairs just to shut up her incessant prattling on about nothing.  This was a huge hit on Broadway and the cast was carried over for the film version; maybe it worked better on stage, I don't know...but it's a pretty awful film; not the classic it's reputed to be. Not a bit of suspense or horror or anything else here to give you chills. Just a chance to watch some good actors like Heckart and Jones stumble around with a silly script and overact like kids in a high school play. It's a lot of fun to watch if your intent is to not take it seriously and to make fun of it. Then you should have a good time.  ****SPOILER FOLLOWS****  Best part? The end when Rhoda gets nailed by a bolt of lightning. Too bad the lightning didn't get her mom at some point early on 
 THE GODSPELL,this book is a way for christians to help them deal with the sin myth  they say im in christ so iam forgiven when i sin then they sin again,again, again BY GRACE what a BLASPHEMY because god cannot be around sin/ NEAR SIN/ CLOSE TOO SIN BUT ALL THE SINS OF THE WORLD WERE PUT ON UPON HIM ON THE CROSS AND CHRISTIANS SIN DAILY GOD CANNOT BE IN THEM(BLANTANT CONTRADICTION) but god is supposedly in christians? DUH, how ignorant are these people... scripture states clearly all the world stands guilty of so called sin page 26 oh how happy are sins are forgiven romans4:7,8 its a way for christians to get a inner peace from sin its a Mask to cover them from GUILT OF SO CALLED SIN theRE mask is "jesus christ" cover up.... the truth is the laws of the universe that really precide around us. not "by the grace of jesus christ we are saved" 1john 1:8,10 this law has no religious bounderies you do wrong to someones spirit you get paid back christian or not you cant go around doing wrong and expect not too have it comeback on you even if you ask god for forgiveness another thing refered to in this book is god is a "he" the being that started the unravelling of the universe is not a he/she it is part of everything in everything we are that "BEING".NO THING IS BETTER THAN ANOTHER THING ALL ARE EQUALLY YOLKED "YING AND YANG" POSITIVE/NEGATIVE THE LAW THAT IS ALL ..RIGHT/WRONG/BLACK/WHITE ETC....CANT EVER HAVE GOOD WITHOUT BAD you would never no what good is without bad. they cant simply be alone its impossible another laughable piece in the book is HEAVEN why would 1/3 of all the angels leave heaven if it is so great?? why because there is no such place.. its the feeling that we wanna have too make are life worth something thats why chrisitains fall back on this belief. chuck states a story about his sisters healing from meningitis page 53 well people who beleive in god or not expierence miracles and blessings of wealth/power ETC all types of things .... not just because your christians.....duh... another crutch to add to the godspell myth this is again the special feeling they get.. wow god did this for me because iam chrisitan ,,,,,,,bla bla blah just GARBAGE this book is BRAINWASHING at its finest .. look at my other reviews for bible contradictions there are verses to show the contradictions OF THE BIBLE... 
 I think the book is raising some good questions and is trying to address very important issues and problems in organizational behavior, but the quality of the content leaves plenty room for improvement. The stories and cases that illustrate the concepts of the book are mostly highly artificial and oversimplified, they are poorly written and could not be read with trust. The examples of the ideas that should help to turn the companies around often are on this level: a new screen saver was installed on every computer in the company as a surprise to the employees and it had a graphic image and a slogan "We will be #1 in the UK market by 2001!". Boom! After that, the company turned around and conquered UK market!   This is definitely well below the bar that Harvard Business School Press should have set for its publications. 
 Mr. Walsh's new book on Stravinsky has some interesting anecdotes and insights into the years in America for the composer but seems to lack real relevance historically.  What seems to be missing from this new book is any primary sources for his many anecdotes. The Stravinsky estate after his death is a matter of public record in the courts, yet Mr. Walsh has not done the research to get the real facts. Why?  There are excellent books by sources much closer to Stravinsky--to say the least Robert Craft's. Craft a twenty year associate of Stravinsky documented just about every waking moment of Stravinsky's life. Referring back to some of Craft's books on Stravinsky I find that Walsh has lifted numerous writings from Craft rather than bringing anything of real interest to life for the reader.  I have to say, this book is not the best work on Stravinsky and I hope other readers will go to better sources for a cohesive and cogent telling of Stravinsky's life and career 
 Ms Rogers the "Queen of Romance" definitely fell off the throne with this story.  I was so disappointed by the lack of passionate, intrigue, and interesting characters that usually populate Ms. Rogers  stories that I want my money back. Unlike previous heroes and heroines  Amalie and Holt are dull and flat.  The only semi-interesting character Kit  Silver is left hanging.  Plot development lacked imagination and the  characters are cardboard. If you want to read a good romance book try some  of Ms. Rogers earlier stories like Sweet Savage Love, at least you won't be  wasting your money 
 Hey, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Yoshimi, but this is just atrocious. Maybe I just don't get it, but I don't want to have to "get" random sounds with Wayne screeching in the foregound. The point of music is for me to listen to it and enjoy it, not be constantly confused about what is coming out of my speakers. Nothing on here comes even close to the greatness of (in order):  Do You Realize? Are You a Hypnotist? Fight Test Yoshimi part 1 Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell Suddenly Everything Has Changed  The only two songs semi worth listening to on this album are: Vein Of stars Pompeii  Download these two and don't waste your time on the rest 
 I can't believe how many reviewers are giving Roddy McDowall accolades for his performance in this monstrosity. Out of all of the shortcomings this movie has, its biggest one is the miscasting of Roddy McDowall in a tough-guy role. I couldn't help but laugh every time he was on the screen, because I couldn't believe a scrawny, short guy with impeccably-pronounced British English in the role of a tough, Old West cowboy. I'm not a macho brute by any means, but when I watch a Western, I want true (actually, make that typical Hollywood formula) cowboys and action.  Other reviewers have rightly mentioned that the plot is a bit thin; it's so thin that you can see right through it. Robert Mitchum was a good actor, and he did the best job in this film even though his character was also poorly written. As for Dean Martin, I never did think he was much of a cowboy actor; he did okay in both "Rio Bravo" and "The Sons of Katie Elder," but it didn't hurt that those were star vehicles for John Wayne; without the Duke, Dino didn't fare as well in Westerns.  The only way they could have made this stinker of a movie entertaining would have been to have Roddy McDowall riding around in an ape costume with an ammo belt draped over his shoulder and a rifle in his hand (I know, I know - he was a 'good' ape). I'm not sure whether this movie or "Planet of the Apes" came out first (both were released in 1968), but that would have made a funny tie-in with "...Apes", and it wouldn't have been any more ludicrous than any of the things that are already in "Five Card DUD" 
 Sorry to be so blunt, but I spent the last 5 weeks cursing the authors of this book (and those that I met on the road with this book felt the same way). Do NOT waste your money on this thing. It is FIVE years old (I live in Seattle and met one of the authors before she left in June '99). The information is totally outdated and some of the campsites no longer exist! My advice is to get a good guide that is updated regularly, maybe get a good idea for a route from the Mountaineers and then get the Michellin map following the scenic (green) routes (or get the special bikes maps from any bookstore (librarie) while you are there). Cycling in France is a breeze. Enjoy France on the bike...there is no greater place to ride. Don't let McGuide mess with your fun. Live to ride...ride to live.. 
 This is HORRIBLE. DON'T be tempted to read it because you're an Austen fan. This author is the example that proves true an essay, The Janeites, about how sometimes.. those who like Austen the most.. would be exactly the ones who disgusted Austen herself 
 This is a boring album from a boring band. It just want to turn it off everytime i hear it. Dont recomend it to any "real" music fan 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro.  I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger.  With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display.  Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep.  With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it.  Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.  I guess I got what I paid for.  A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30.  I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port "hockey puck" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs.  No problems with those 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 Norwood was a sure cure for the insomnia I've been experiencing.  The characters were forgettable except that I wanted to slap most of them before committing them to oblivion, and the content as flat as the tires  should have been on the stolen cars.  Had they been flat they would have  gone nowhere, which is exactly where this book went for me 
 This is NOT the Helicoptor you will get.  This is a picture of Tonka's BIG helicoptor, and they are passing it off as this one.  Beware, things look better than they are 
 If you're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on. There is nothing of substance in Cosmopolitan. Open the latest issue and you will find "sex tips that will drive your man crazy!!!" and "snag that cutie!!" galore. It's pathetic. And sophomoric.  The sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a) Looking for your "one true love" and by default B) How to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search! And let's not forget inane question and answer spreads. Those are a hoot with such inquires as "my crack gets really itchy. What should I do?"  No, this magazine is not my bible.  This is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection) 
 Anya , Battle Rages and Solitaire  are very good songs.  The rest of this album was really a disappointment for me as a fanatical Deep Purple fan.   I honestly to this day listen to (the generally poorly received) Slaves and Masters more often.  To my ears it sounded like a group who rushed to get the Cd out prematurely.  In fact, songs like Lick it Up,  One Man's Meat. and Talk About Love Reminded me of reject songs off Ian Gillan's solo LP Naked Thunder.  
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 The history of corporate finance is a fascinating subject, overflowing with interesting people and dramatic events that affect not only finance but the man on the street.    Unfortunately the authors of this book have no interest in breathing life into the story of capitalism.  Instead what a reader will get is a dry list of facts.  The regulated company evolved into the joint stock company for the following reasons.  The East India Company developed the following innovations.  Its example paved the way for the next step, and so on.  The book has all the feeling of a dull term paper written by a college student who simply summarized the obvious secondary sources.  Each step seems to lead naturally, ploddingly to the next, in a march that seems both uninteresting and inevitable.    While the authors have done an impressive job of bringing many important facts over a broad context together in one volume, that's all they've done.  And I detected a subtle smugness, like that of a Monday morning quarterback, as the authors pointed out flaws in earlier structures.  To me they seemed unaware that the flaws in today's systems will look as obvious to future scholars as those of the past seem now to us.  I also encountered what I considered to be lapses in scholarship (or insight) brought about by the "Ivory Tower" phenomenon of having only a an academic understanding of processes undertaken by others.  The coverage of LBOs is an example.  It's easy in hindsight to go on about the excesses of leveraged buyout era of the 1980s.  Baskin and Miranti cover this fully, detailing many of the problems that arose.  But was there any rationale for the LBOs in the first place, or were they simply the instruments of greedy financial conmen?  On p291 the authors begin one paragraph with the following: "One important method applied by LBO organizers to achieve superior performance was to change ownership structures."  Having lived through that era, I'm aware of how misleading that statement can be.  At the time there were a number of public companies that weren't well managed and had languishing stock prices that not only didn't reflect the firms' potential, but didn't even reflect the value of their current operations.  Traditionally this obvious problem (the stock's trading at $35 and it's worth $60) had no easy solution.  Until LBOs came along (both friendly and unfriendly), there was little that could be done.  LBO firms were able to convince investors that a company was undervalued, provide a method for quickly realizing this value, and prove that it could be done.  Many decry the fact that jobs were sometimes lost in the process; a point worth considering.  But this doesn't take away from the fact everyone who owns stocks today has a portfolio that's more fairly and appropriately valued because of the rationalizing force introduced by leveraged buyouts.  Valuing these companies wasn't the innovation, any grad student could have done that.  It was coming up with a way to prove that these valuations mattered, and that management would be held accountable for them, that was the innovation.    Now when incompetent management is forced out as a result of an LBO, is that a "change in ownership structure?"  I guess so.  But for me the phrase fails to capture the essence of what is taking place.  Is quickly realizing the value in a company whose stock is trading too cheaply "achieving superior performance?"  I wouldn't call it that, but I suppose an academic might.  The point here is that an intelligent laymen looking to expand his or her knowledge and become interested in a fascinating topic will be poorly served by this type of phraseology.    Not recommended. 
 The mystery was boring, the characters tedious, and continually having events re-examined from someone else's point of view was a yawn. Why has a mummy in silk underwear been brought to the Emerson family's attention? What is the connection with the mysterious American millionaire and his man-eating daughter? By the end, I didn't much care. The Peabody novels have been going downhill as the series progresses, and I think the essential reason is that the author loves her main characters, the Emerson family, too much. They are perfect by default, no matter how reprehensible or stupid their behaviour, because they are the main characters and her beloved creations - it is only others who can be at fault. Rarely does anything truly bad ever happen to them, and if it does it is because of their "virtue" and "nobility" 
 It is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head. It skims the surface and is 'pop'.   Anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world.   Again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world (Newsweek is exactly the same)  especially in the United States.   TIME magazine is from the same people that gave us CNN and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the U.S. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice.   The other irritating thing about TIME is it's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious.  Subscribe to the ECONOMIST, there are less pictures !            
 I agree with the last reader.  I didn't finish this book, it was SO boring.  NOTHING happened.  And the characters were annoying.  I read a lot of books that aren't action-oriented and like them.  But this one was  awful 
 I received what looked like a nicely preserved used copy.  The book literally fell apart from the binding the first time I read it. It continued to come unglued from the binding each time I attempted to read it.  Not a good quality copy.  Would not purchase from this supplier agai 
 It's beyond my comprehension how this book made #2 on the NYT list of the best novels of the last 25 years.  While it's well-written (in a structural, grammatical sense), it's devoid of any semblance of a plot or story line.  There were so many extraneous, disconnected sections that it made me wonder whether Mr. Delillo was somehow able to publish this book without the scrutiny of an editor.  My only satisfaction was in persevering to the end of this ponderous tome 
 Wow - hard to put into words how bad this was...... We kept waiting for the funny - it never came - we didn't even watch the end.... when they started turning Julia Roberts (Tess) into the "real" Julia Roberts - well - we were done....... note funny - no......... 
 Just plain, lots of photographs and little substance. Won't add anything new or usefull if you are a skilled cook.  
 I'm not faulting the research, which is comprehensive; it is the format that the author chooses to present this information that is so difficult to digest. On any given page there are as many as 15 different names with barely enough information about each artist to differentiate them from one another. The book is so short and so densely packed that it is difficult to absorb the information. The author uses the regionalization of the Blues as it traveled from the South to the North as his basis for examination; occasionally throwing in lyrics or musical notes to support a point, but their inclusion seems to be haphazard at best. If you are looking for a tremendous amount of information about the Blues this is fine, but if you are looking for an enjoyable read, look elswhere 
 A very lackluster effort.  Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself.  I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination 
 Michael Levin is a perfect example of what happens when you take a chap and put him through a Ph.D. program. Because he masters (absolutely) one tiny thing, he thinks he can speak authoritatively on everything. The result, in the words of Kant, is ein Mangel an Urteilskraft (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, A135/B173). [We can cite Kant here; Levin seems to like Kant's view, though he also seems to get it wrong -- typical AngloAmerican twit.]  Let's put aside the question of political correctness; the main problem is that Levin has mistaken mere evidence -- inherently problematic -- for scientific explanation.  This is to say, his book is fine, but his fundamental assumption of the adequacy of evidence, and the model constructed from it, is mysterious, wrongheaded and mistaken.  The result is a very dull book, actually.  You can get the same errors from The Bell Curve, which is at least better written and where the yucks are a good deal easier to find 
 First let me state that the terms "technotrash pseudo-fiction" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.  Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 I teach an inclusion third grade with about half of my class being special education students.  They are having a hard time understanding multiplication and how it works, so I thought this book would be a great visual!  I was very, very wrong.  I should have listened to the other review on this book.  I agree that the art terminology gets confusing with the math explanations.  I feel the author could have explained the math in more detail and left out the art all together.  I will not even read this book to my class because I know that it will only further confuse them, rather then help them.  So this purchase was a waste of my hard earned money that I thought I was putting towards helping my students.  Don't make the same mistake!   
 The obverse of these cards are gorgeous, just as the Rider Waite cards should be.  However, the reverses are just plain ugly, with a sort of plaid geometric pattern in blue and black on them.  I was very disappointed, as I expected the reverses to be as attractive as the obverses, but the designs don't match at all.  I'm looking for another with a better design, perhaps the Universal Waite 
 Osborne and Gaebler's ideas have been around a long time; don't be misled into thinking this is something new.  Particularly objectionable is their use of phrases such as "sluggish pace of bureaucracy" which is  designed to feed into the reader's own stereotype.  The book feeds upon the  fear of the reader, and therefore does not offer much in the way of  scholarly reading.  One would do better to read some Herbert Simon or  Charles Goodsell before embarking on this journey 
 This is a one-time watch. It is most definately a home movie with very unprofessional editing. I was hoping for at least one or two songs to have a professional mix. Never happened.. 
 This book is more of the same rehashed, recycled, repurposed content from the authors. Much of this material is available in any basic marketing text. In fact, this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding. If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y&R, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. The "editorial reviews" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as "cases" in the book.  Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called "thought leadership", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking. Save your money. Don't become a victim of Prophet's propoganda. Buy something with substance like Jean Noel Kapferer.  
 The Shipping News by Annie Proulx is a rather odd book. Little action, nice descriptions of Nova Scotia, and far fetched characters are in this book.  The book tells the story of Quoyle. Quoyle is a newspaper reporter for a 3rd rate paper in New York. He is ugly, fat, and has very low self esteem. After his wife leaves him for another man and sells his two daughters (as I said, odd book), his wife dies in a car accident. Quoyle takes back his kids and moved back to his ancestrial homeland of Killick-Claw Nova Scotia. There he lives day-to-day.  I read this book with several other people. All of them found this book very boring and hard to get through. Nobody felt any remorse for the protaganists problems, or even cared.   I would not suggest this book. It is kinda like a roller coaster,once you think that you are going for the sky (an interesting plot development), you find yourself plunging toward the ground. For the story gets worse 
 Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg 
 This book, although beautifully written, did not make sense.  I was intrigued by the characters yet finished the book not understanding their motivations.  I would have liked to know more about the narrator, Susan, and her life immediately after the fatal accident.  Instead I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story, with big gaps missing throughout. Perhaps some skillful editing would have made this more of a complete tale 
 To the reviewer who wasn't able to see his own image, I recommend turning on the light in the room :o) Pic is fine on my iBook G4 running OX 4, but camera crashes Yahoo msg constantly, even with the 5USD downloaded driver from macally! Manual is useless - only tells you that you can have other people view your image online. Duh! What a shockingly innovative feature for a webcam? :op Next time I will probably spend a little more and get a cam that will work properly with Mac 
 I ordered a product that showed a correct hinged replacement fixture for my Igloo cooler but when it arrived what showed up was a completely different product of lesser stature and quality. I will never order from them again 
 If any man had the genius to create the Shroud of Turin, it would had been Leonardo.  Too bad the Shroud's KNOWN history predates the adult Leonardo by more than a century.   Was an "inferior" Shroud replaced by a superior one? Not according to early illustartions of the Shroud, one even depicts the four "poker hole" burns the Shroud currently features. Again, this illustration dramatically predates Leonardo.   Also, readers need to read about "The Oveido Cloth," a relic that could be linked to the Turin Shroud and is confidently dated to at least 800 CE.   The final nail in the coffin for this book is the idea that Leonardo was the inventor of photography, but ultimately sat on this astonishing discovery due to some forged relic he created.  Jeff Messenger,  the author of  the novel "the Shroud of Torrington. 
 I read this book as a selection for my book club.  After all the fan fair, this book was a complete disappointment -- and let me tell you, we've read some bad books in the past.  This one takes the cake.  I can get past the fictional aspect of the book; however, the supposed "great writing" is just not there.  I found this book to be very superficial, although the story line had great promise. A considerable struggle to get through and little if any flow to the writing 
 My son is 8 months old.  He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing.  I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat.  It does not help in this regard at all.  In fact, it just annoys him.  I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.  Very disappointed in Californi 
 As a fan of kathy's first video -- total fitness workout -- i was really looking forward to this one.  I hate to say this but it really stinks -- working out has to be fun, concise, get the job done etc. etc... this isn't fun and it's way too long and just plain boring.  I turned it off after the first 15 minutes -- don't bother buying this one, it's terrible!!  It's not an exercise routine that you would enjoy doing over and over -- what happened??? 
 Oh my word.  I have only ever not been able to finish a book twice in my life -- and this was number 2.  The first few chapters were ok, but when things really started cooking plot-wise, the writing style became, well, high-schoolish.  I wanted to like it, so I plowed ahead.  But, half-way through it, I gave up.  The writing style is amateurish, and clunky.  Characters act in a melodramatically, with no realism.  There are patches of good writing, but these patches are quickly followed by a clunker or two.     I would hope that the sequel to this book improved, but since I can't finish the first, I won't be trying the second 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 Personally none too impressed with this effort. Tom Miller obviously has the ability to create 3D games, but his attempt at allowing the book buying public the chance to learn some of his skills didn't help me a bit!  Explanations were introduced at a far higher level than I would have liked, and the learning curve seemed to go from 0-200 mph within around 5-6 pages.  Examples didn't work, and I actually had to scour the internet for solutions from other readers, in order to progress with the book!....  Save your money!!!!! 
 This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.  However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.  Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking 
 This book concentrates on dry stone walls, even though the title does specifically say this.  Although the book does mention mortar stone walls, minimal detail and description is provided.  One could not possibly build a mortar stone wall from reading this book 
 This book was not helpful at all. I take substitute teaching and education seriously. I was looking for real activities that I could use when the teacher did not leave plans or if I had a few minutes to spare. The activities were not original or helpful.  Additionally, the pages looked like a child designed them. It was not professional. Neither was the publishing. Much of the ink was faded. 
 This video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball.  I don't care for the woman who does it -- I find her personality a little annoying.  That aside, there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position.  This makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions.  It's nice the first time through because you are just learning.  But I would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position 
 I would have given this book no stars, but that's not an option in the review program.  I am returning this book to Amazon.  The 'research' base for this book is clergy and committed christians.  I didn't get that information from the info on Amazon.  The book is not scientific.  Unscientific 'facts' are presented such as- early puberty is caused by exposure to TV and sexual situations presented there.  NO science, data base composed completely of christian men very involved with the church and a rip off to men who really want to know what is going on with them 
 IF there was a lower rating  than 1...... I would use it .It would not read my SD cards and to top it off now my card refused to work in the camera.....so now I am out off pocket 7.95 and my 256Mb SD card....it's gonna cost me more in shipping to return this cotton-picking item.... 
 This guy is pretty much in the same league as Jack Kirby. Whereas Kirby's all soft lines and images pancaked on the page, Dore looks like he's carving his cartoons into a tree. And all these scary demons and things look tired, like they've been running marathons all day. The victims kind of look like they're enjoying it, so I guess if you're into S&M, I could recommend it. Me, I prefer "Spawn" by Todd McFarlane. The Violator? Now that's a monster you can sink your eyeballs into. And I know it's like super-uber hip, but I don't know why these illustrators feel they are so special when they work exclusively in shades of black. Like my momma used to say, "A little rouge really accents the cheekbones. 
 As was stated before, this is just "Ultimate Yes" with different packaging. If it was possible to give this no star instead of one, I would, but the Amazon rating system doesn't let you rate anything a zero (or lower). Go to Rhino's Website and e-mail them the thumbs-down 
 This book was recommended to me by an accupuncturist who did a great job on my back.  I found it contradictory and ultimately confusing to the point of being useless.  Readers are encouraged to diagnose themselves as being damp or dry, warm or cold, with an interior or exterior issue, and with an excess or a deficiency.  (There may be more categories, that's all I can remember now.)  The main problem with the book is that if one is, say, both damp and cold (which Pitchford states is a common combination) then the dietary advice is contradictory.  One chapter says to eat raw vegetables, the next says no.  One says eat meat, the next says no.  One says fruit, the next says no.  One stresses brown rice, the next says very little brown rice.  In addition, being too far along one axis is the same as being the opposite condition.  If you just said "Huh??" then get used to it if you order this book.    Lastly, the big puzzle to me in reading all these 5 star reviews is that not one person (unless there is a review I missed) discusses how their health was improved, how they lost weight, anything!  Isn't that really the proof of a book on dietary recommendations?    Bottom line:  eat whole foods, not processed, organic if possible, and a variety of produce, whole grains, and small portions of lean meat.  I just saved you 700+ pages of reading and $30-something.  And you're welcome. 
 The magazine has a broad range of patterns. Out of 1 year there are about 10 things I want to make.  Or I should say I wanted to make- Until I started on the first one.    They have a high percentage of errors in the patterns.  One Issue had 13 out of 30 that had corrections.  The worst part is, they don't seem to post corrections until a reader has tried to knit the item and told them what was wrong. Which means that unless you want to do a lot of counting, calculating, ripping and reknitting, you have to wait until an issue has been out for 6 months and other readers have found the errors.  I'm working on a cardigan that I plan to give to someone for Christmas, and have found 2 major errors so far.  No idea if I will get this done in time and when I get done if I'll have a cardigan or a layette!  One more error that causes me to rip it out and start over and I'll find a new pattern or make my own.  After spending $130 on angora yarn to make this gift, I'm not going to give up, but the renewal notices I get for the magazine are promptly thrown out.  update- Still working on the cardigan, have pretty much had to start over and redesign the pattern on my own.  Still no correction online, but they have added many other corrections for other patterns from this issue. The Corrections sometimes are little, simple ones, but some of the corrections are a total rewriting of the instructions or charts!  I have thrown out all of the magazines so I don't get tempted to try another pattern from them 
 This is one of the most boring movies that I ever saw. The DVD box says: "If you enjoy Snatch you'll enjoy this" (or something like that)... with this great cast you must think that's true, but the movie is horrible, I tought Kevin Spacey was a smart guy when he pick un scripts, but I guess I was wrong. The movie is soo slow that you may get sleep... Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't see it on television.. 
 I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.  Be very careful with these people, as you're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty, non-functioning bookend 
 I should qualify this review by stating that I am not an expert on the subject of improvement.  This book will not make you or even guide you to expertise.  The only shining concept within the book, PDSA, is a great format for structuring improvement within a company, but could have been summed up successfully in 20 pages or less.  BOOKS SHOULD NOT SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR VOLUME ADVERTISING THEMSELVES 
 worked great for Mom .but was destroyed by my 12 year old in about 30 min. She broke the pins off that hold it in place when she was trying to change the games. The extended battery option was GREAT 
 I got this album after hearing "Some Kind of Zombie", "Underdog", "Lift", and "Worldwide".  Before getting "Bloom" I was a total AA junkie.  Then I heard "Bloom".  It shows that AudioA really matured after that, but still...  The only good song on this album is "Never Gonna Be As Big As Jesus", and even that's not as good as their more recent stuff.  The lyrics in this album are absolutely horrible and cliche, as though they couldn't think of anything creative to write (i.e.: "I'm not the king, I just sing"...ugh).  The music itself all sounds the same--they didn't bother to try to sound different on any of the songs like on more recent albums.  All in all, this is a poorly crafted album, with one good song and a funny throw away song ("Jazz Odyssey").  I heard that this was AA's best song--who was the dummy who said that?  I suggest you borrow it to hear "Never Gonna Be As Big As Jesus" but don't buy it.  I haven't heard anything before "Bloom" but everything they made after "Bloom" is 100% better.  Go get that.  And maybe try "The Swift" by The Swift and "Adoration" by Newsboys in addition to that.  In conclusion, "Bloom" is a failure to make a good album, overusing the music style and under-using creative lyrics 
 When I get a landscaping book I like to see plenty of examples in full color pictures. Maybe get a few ideas and see what others have come up with that I can mix and integrate into my own water garden. This book is 95% wording and 5% pictures. I thought the book was a little dry and uninteresting. I'm glad I got it on E-Bay for $2.50 because I would never pay full price for it 
 Its ok.  Of course if you take a philosophy class in todays secular universities, you will read 20 things by hume and other atheists and not much pro theism.  His work is ok, but I actually used it as part of a proof that God does exist 
 I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.  The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away.  This obviously was not thought out by the author.  This is not a romance,  but a calamity. Boo! Boo! on the author.  This is terrible writing.  I do not recommend this book 
 This is an interesting, knowledgeable, but very short and skimpy, paperback book by a professor of neurobiology whose perspective is that of a primatology/evolutionary psychologist. The book contains some tiny photographs of the primates in question. It is a decent addition to the collection of anybody who is obsessed with learning every last thing about our various ape relatives.   My complaint/concern is that the author's description of the book, and the example photos shown on Amazon, might lead one to expect it to contain high quality photographs. Instead, what you get is a tiny paperback of miniscule, grainy, terribly reproduced amateur black-and-white photographs by the professor, many of them shot at the zoo.   Do NOT be deceived by the lovely color photographs in the publicity. There are no color photographs, or well-reproduced photographs, except on the front and back covers. Really, this has the feel of a home-made vanity press kind of book.   For a more thorough treatment of the topic of human/ape nature, consider reading Frans De Waal's "Our Inner Ape". De Waal also published a book of gorgeous photographs of primates. For a more thorough exploration of evolutionary psychology, see Pinker's How The Mind Works.  
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Walking the Bible (I do not have the book that the DVD is a companion to) to me was, in a word, vague.  For example, the scene standing atop Mt Nebo, made on a foggy day showed little and told little of the significance of that place.  How far from Jerusalem was it?  What are the other mountains like nearby are they taller, shorter, or the same height? Which way is Jerusalem?  Is that the Dead Sea off in the distance? What can be seen from there on a clear day? What cannot be seen because the mountain is too low? What is the land like there for farming in comparison to what is across the river?  Where did Israel cross over from there?, was it in a place where Moses could have witnessed?  The DVD has a Bible reading and some spiritual comments, but that is it. 
 Jacob Needleman has been writing books of great interest to all who students of the human condition for many years. I think, however, that he has been led into deep murkiness by too many years spent studying the works of Gurdjieff, to whom he gives scant credit here. Whatever it is, some of his thoughts, particularly in chapter 11, the Essence, are so incoherently expressed as to baffle the reader. He clearly knows a good deal but his ability to express his ideas seems to have been lost 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6.  First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped. Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone.  BEWARE... DON'T BUY 
 I'm not sure what this movie was about.  It had all of the hollywood cliches such as a nude shower scene, the older astronaut dies tragically, one astronaut turns on the other and murders him, there's man eating bugs, a murderous robot, and a star trek style fight scene where he outsmarts a robot with his ingenuity.  Its ironic that the guy is saved by a russian spacecraft since american movies always make fun of Russians even though they've put more astronauts in space than we ever have been able to.  The breathable air thing was odd.  All that equipment and they forgot to check the air on mars when they landed?  Could have saved them a lot of trouble if they stuck to the post-landing checklist.  I thought "Mission to Mars" was much better, indicating how bad this movie was.  Mission to Mars was hokey but at least it had an interesting plot 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 Good writers should be able to make their work suitable for all ages (especially younger readers) without making their prose sound overly simplistic or juvenile. This should be especially easy for books on baseball, since there's "a lot of little boy" in both the writers and readers - it should come naturally. Perfect, unfortunately, is just plain bad. How these writers can take some of the most dramatic stories of baseball and make them uninteresting and virtually unreadable leaves me (nearly) speechless. Even Ken Burns' Baseball series' mention of some of the perfect games in far less space is far more compelling. In addition, I found that there was really very little information - even with the recent games - that isn't already readily available in the briefest of articles found elsewhere. At most a few known quotes and dugout/clubhouse anecdotes can be found for each game, amid a wash of overly simplistic and juvenile text. Book should have been titled "See Spot Pitch". Can't recommend it, sadly 
 I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.  But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flatline of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pagent of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was miniscule.   My overwhelming aftertast of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten 
 I heard this with a friend of mine the other night. My initial reaction was utter disbelief that something like this was possible. I thought I was having a nightmare of the kind you get after eating bad Dominoes pizza right before bed. I'm sorry, but when the classic lounge-lizard style and tacky big-band arrangements are applied to tunes like Smoke on the Water, Paradise City, and Enter Sandman, the result can only be described as a twisted surrealistic malevolence. On this cd, Pat Boone succeeded in weaving a twisted web of musical destruction with every note! Among the adjectives that came to our minds when listening included bizarre, vile, criminal, musical manslaugther, and aural malfeasance. On Crazy Train, you get backup singers who belt these "Crazy Train, Crazy Train, Choo-choo-choo" lyrics! Absolutely mind-boggling! I thought the entire universe was going to implode! Just what was going through Pat Boone's mind when he did this? Was he bored in retirement and needed something to occupy his time? Why didn't he just take up golf or shuffleboard or something? Why'd he have to inflicit this inflammatory drek on us for? It's too bad that we have no laws to put people in jail for such artistic malevolance! Listen to this cd a few times for some belly laughs, then stick it in the annals of your collection as it becomes one of the all-time whacky novelties in recording history.      
 i practically fell asleep while watching this tape, the girl doing the exercises isn't even saying anything while she's doing it. It's a voice over! also she's all alone in a blank room. All the exercises are basically the same. I would suggest Mtv Pilates. It's a lot more fun 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 This was published in 1994 - it still talks about "dot matrix printers" and manual accounting...save your money and look at some other really terrific resources online (specifically by Zondervan - very good).  Not helpful at all if you know even basic accounting 
 This author claims that the Baudelaire children cannot see through Count Olaf's disguises, which is patently absurd, as any reader of the Snicket series would know.  She has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim, and I would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy, let alone to anyone to read.   Either she didn't read the books, didn't really absorb what she read, or most likely, merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on Snicket's good name.  Don't read this book, don't get it from a library, it is a big waste of time. 
 For those of you reading the entire series of  " In Death" books this is a real disappointment.  I'm wondering if someone else wrote it.  There is no candy bar thief, Peabody, McNab development,  insights into Eve's past, just nothing!  Yes, Mavis having the baby is progress but that could have been done in 5 pages.  Please Nora, spend a little more time with the characters in the next book.  Or if you are tired of them, wrap it up.  This one is a real stinker. 
 Here's a quick comparison for my wireless mouse: Duracell: 1 month Memorex: 2 days  DO I HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE? 
 As much as I love Leon's music, I can't enjoy this due to the atrocious sound quality. I recommend getting the self-titled debut or the "Shelter People" instead 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 This set of sheets was a bargain... NOT! They immediately started to "pill" and are definitely not the size that it says on the package. I'm guessing, these sheets are probably from the back of the "reject" pile! I would send them back... but it wouldn't be worth the cost of shipping... believe it when they tell you, "you get what you pay for~ 
 Save yourself the shipping costs of returning, don't make my mistake. THIS IS THE US EDITION EXPORTED TO CANADA! This is not the real UK edition. Not even close!!! Who knows why they think Americans want to hear this stuff, but go and order from the MoS website or from amazon.co.uk. This disaster never used to occur in years past before HMV "teamed" with Amazon, go figure 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 This book bored both my husband and myself . . . and we're eclectic readers, hard to turn off once we've committed to a book.  Levine's earlier work is good, but IMHO by now success has gone to his head.  Take a "Marriage Enrichment" course or something, but don't waste your $ on this book 
 This book really wasn't at all what I was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The subtitle, "In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea," makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at all...  "The Pirate Queen" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of "personal bath mats" in northern European hotels... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.  This is a shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself, Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser, Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur, Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the "herring lassies," and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. You may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed the Caribbean.  As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For example: "The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead 
 I thought the book was rather bland and perverse. Not much interaction between the 2 main characters and I found the suspense plot lacking as well.  Bottom line: Do not recommend. 
 I had read a lot of John Irving when I was younger and was excited to read a new book of his. But this very long book is way below his usual standard. The characters are unlikable and not believable and it just goes on and on. If you want to read John Irving try his earlier work 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on 
 Nearing completion of my first semester of law school, I can say that the gross majority of advice in this book was totally incorrect. It was actually detrimental to me to read this book 
 I was excited to finally get this book in the mail, but I felt unmoved after I looked through it. I sat and read through it all in one sitting like I did with the first book, but it felt as though everything was rushed. The book was lacking in variety and seemed almost repetetive. Some of the secrets really touched me (don't get me wrong), but the overall impact of the book was lukewarm at best. If you haven't yet, I would suggest reading the first book over this one 
 I bought the 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because of the new armor, adventuring gear, clothing table, food and drink prices table, poison table, vehicles, and creatures (mounts, pets, etc). I did not buy 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because I was expecting a miracle.  Good thing, too, because the book didn't provide much more than I wanted. Yes, there are hundreds of new weapons and  other random things, but everything blurs together in one run-on list. I'm not that fond of the magic weapons list, but the things I did want were there, thus I bought the book.  If you're looking for random information to throw at your DM or include in the game, this can be a helpful book. Don't buy it if you're looking for an awesome addition to your equipment and arms collection, because it probably won't help you much 
 This was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look. 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This book was ok . Its sad because Gebu beats Ranofer but the ending stunk 
 First of all let me say that the overall mystery was boring and I knew the ending very eraly in the book....nothing new to offer here.  I read a lot of series where you can predict what happens but great characters make is worth the reading.  This isn't one of those books.  The mystery starts in such a contrived way!!  19 years ago a murder of two girls took place in Syracuse.  "Bunny" (our protagonist) is not from Syracuse but happens to live there now because her husband is from there.  She is from Long Island and California old money.  But she happens to be in Syracuse now.  At the same time it happens that she is handed a set of dog tags, from her father-in-law, that were found at the murder site.  The tags also happen to be from her cousin-who does not live in Syracuse but happened to be in town at the same time the murder took place.  How contrived is that?  If "Bunny" wasn't married to his son would the tags remained ignored? Could there be a more contrived connection than the tags belonging to her cousin? It is a poor way to get into a mystery. Anyway, anyone who reads mysteries can guess who did the murder quickly.  The real problem I had was with "Bunny" - the main protagonist. What a distasteful unpleasant character she is.  Her whole "stick" is that she hates Syracuse.  From page one she complains about living in Syracuse and it seems not a page goes by without another complaint about living in Syracuse.  Don't get me wrong..I am from Buffalo and left ASAP - but and here's the thing - my complaints about Buffalo are things that are about me or generic. For example, I hate the winters there or  I wanted to move away from my family. But for a lot of people, Buffalo is the place to live.  I get that - to each their own.  But not "Bunny" - oh no not her.  I have read many many novels where the main character wants to leave their present local - be it the big city, the midwest, the farm, the small town..etc.  But "Bunny's" complaints are so nasty.  She puts down how the people of Syracuse live, what they eat, how they dress, how they spend their money, what music they listen to, etc.  "Bunny" is a spoiled brat, and a condescending snob and I don't want to spend anymore time with her. I only finished the book to see if she grew up....she didn't.   According to the book jacket - the author's life is very similar to "Bunny's" so I can only guess that "Bunny's" words, thoughts, and attitudes are Cornelia Read's.  If that's the case what a poor sad person she is.  One more comment on the book jacket.  There is a blurb from Ken Bruen on the back of the jacket..complimenting the book.  I don't buy it.  Anyone who writes like Ken Bruen can't possible like such a pedestrian mystery -and I know from reading Bruen's Jack Taylor series that Jack reads a lot. And the mystery authors he cites in his novels are not near the same league as this one.  Jack Taylor wouldn't waste his time - I doubt Ken Bruen did either 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I have been trying to help a friend critique her mystery novel and get it ready to publish and thought that a published author would be able to help. Unfortunately, this is not the right book for it. I passed up other lesser known 'How-To' authors in favor of this one, and I regret it. You know you are in trouble when the first page is a FOREWARD (instead of a FOREWORD) and the guy who writes it spends all but the last sentence of it talking about himself instead of about Hayden's book.   The first 80 or so pages are not bad. They are very general, but there is some good advice there. Then from there on, the author spends the next 40 pages giving trite and yawn-worthy grammar and usage advice. The final 30 pages before all the author interviews are general commentary about contracts, mystery groups, and writing a series, but again, it is all so general as not to be very helpful at all.  From page 152 on through the interviews, we are treated to some interesting stuff from various midlist to famous authors, but none of it helps reach the goal of the title, Writing the Mystery: A Start to Finish Guide for Both Novice and Professional.   Lastly the FAQ and Index are both rather weak. This book is not detailed enough to help a novice, and it is so general that a professional would only sit there saying, "yes, I knew that, yes, I knew that, duh, nothing new there, etc." The writer is cogent, and her delivery sound, but this sure doesn't help anyone much if it is not always really on-topic in a way to help write a novel. A good editor could have cut half the blather and inserted another 100 pages of helpful details and advice. The book just does not go anywhere, and I am sorry I bought it instead of one of the other mystery crafting novels. Back to the drawing board 
 Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings 
 The book is interesting in that the author tries to relate human consciousness, quantum physics, and eastern mysticism to an undersdtanding of dreams. Some of his commnents are thought prevoking but the material  needs to be more tightly organized. He keeps telling the reader "I  will explain this more fully in a later chapter...". This made the 360  page read less enjoyable for me than it might have been had the material  been presented in a less conversational format 
 The premise of this book is interesting; for some unknown reason a few immortals are born here and there around the planet. This is not so much a novel as a disjointed collection of vignettes and short stories that cover the centuries since ancient Phoenicia to a bizarre future where everyone is immortal. If you are expecting the derring-do and character development of the television series Highlander, skip this book. It drags unmercifully in parts, and is overall unsatisfying and (dare I say it?) boring 
 There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title.   For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source.  Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year 
 Great Expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written. I'm no Dickens' expert, but I do know a little about literature- I don't know how this even passed through the editing stage. It is slow-paced, boring, pointless, and an all-out waste of time to read. I have read challenging books with strong points like this before, and have sometimes enjoyed them,  but never have I read a book this pointless and difficult to read, with such a stupid ending.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND VALUABLE TIME ON IT!!!!!! 
 I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work.  This one is far below his usual quality!  The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it "Rock On with NAWSA"), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: "I'm having dinner with Helen Keller." The reporter, "Don't stare, she hates that."  Yet, I suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music: rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s, it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns. Indeed, one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was "Ain't She Sweet"-- a Roarin' Twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by Paul Ash & His Orchestra at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker.   Alice Paul was hardly a flapper, nor was she an astute poitical strategist. She was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater, much more productive efforts of Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston) and others who had continued the struggle since Seneca Falls in 1848. Catt used Paul's antics to good effect in eventually persuading President Wilson (here, woefully overweight) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the Great War. Paul was at most a footnote in the process.   I showed this film to my Gilded Age-Progressive Era class last spring; consider a few written comments from today's undergraduates: "disjointed" -- "historically inept and emotion-ridden" -- "this was Hilary Swank in INSOMNIA Part 2" -- "numerous historical inaccuracies included women's hair and men's clothing styles from later eras, the misuse of props like a small woman's wrist watch and a Crown Graphic press camera, both of which did not exist in 1918, plus the American flag behind Wilson is hung backwards" -- "the parts where she (Paul/Swank) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by Speiberg, but his was more convincing" & my favorite: "why not really screw it up and throw in a little Helen Reddy at the end? 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 You know you're in trouble when the "meet cute" scene is rude and obnoxious.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a drama with funny moments, not a comedy with dramatic moments.  In drama, the world is allowed to fall apart, in comedy, you expect a happy ending.  Everything about this movie is ambiguous and edgy.  You don't know if you are supposed to like him (Vince Vaughn) or her (Jennifer Aniston), the set pieces are cruel, the redemptive moments inadequate...the movie fails because the characters aren't lovable on their own or together.  This was a movie that needed another re-write, either to tone down the farcical elements or to play up the happy and gentle moments.  While both actors could do both comedy and drama (and Vaughn does convey some surprising real character development), they can't bridge both in this movie.  The tone is off -- it's too heavy for their personas.  I would recommend this for folks considering a break-up who want to have a second opinion.  I would not recommend it for folks who are in the middle of a fight.  It will add fuel to the fire 
 This series obviously suffered horrible rewrite ambushing as the network slashed their future (& their budget) by axing a second series. It shows, the CGI sequences are weedy and the dialogue becomes trite & suitable only for simpletons.....shame....as an idea it had potential 
 The one star is for the bag it comes in. You can take these things along with you...but honestly, how many of these things will you really need? Maybe just two of them, the nail clippers and the bulb syringe...I have the set, given to me as a gift. I say, just buy these things separately, it's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you...it's more practical than buying this whole set.. 
  These words are spoken by a fox, one of the villains of this book, to a talking bone, one of the heroes. The bone is not inanimate - it is a sentient creature with feelings and a sweet disposition.  There is no doubt that Steig is brilliant, but in The Amazing Bone he seems to have lost his bearings. How can a book purportedly written for children include a character that takes pleasure from inflicting pain, and describes it in this graphic way?  The fox also menaces Pearl, a darling piglet who is the other protagonist of the book. Her trouble starts, as it might for any child, as follows: "It was a brilliant day, and instead of going straight home from school, Pearl dawdled".  As she slowly makes her way home through idyllic scenery, Pearl happens upon the talking bone. "'May I take you home with me, wonderful bone?' Pearl asked".  But the happy scene is soon interrupted by three masked robbers who put a gun to the head of the innocent child. With the help of the bone Pearl escapes, only to fall into the clutches of the even more sinister fox. The shocking threat of torture follows as the valiant bone tries to rescue its new friend for a second time.  "When they arrived at the fox's hideaway, he shoved Pearl into and empty room and locked the door". While there are many such scenes in the Little Red Riding Hood genre of fairy tale, there is something particularly violent and dark in Stieg's portrayal. The image of Pearl cowering on the floor of the locked room awaiting her fate is disturbing to the extreme.  Notwithstanding a happy ending it's clear that this book can't be recommended for children, and that it isn't intended for adults. This being the case it is surprising that in 1977 it was recognized by the American Library Association as a Caldecott Honor Book. Certainly Steig's artful and evocative illustrations are remarkable, but should not have been sufficient, in and of themselves, for the conferring of this prestigious award 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious "To Die For."  The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.   
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 This one will help you go to sleep for sure. This is my second attempt at Ross MacDonald and I give up. Endings are a given, no surprises here 
 Sorry everyone but I have been recruiting for over 8 years and this book is literally NOTHING NEW!!!! Please save your money on the training and the book. SORRY! You would be better off investing in a years worth of service from a company that has a really good search engine that really does about the same thing. Plus, now adays you can't get into the sites like you used to anyway so 1/2 of this stuff is totally out dated! I feel totally ripped off. If you know just the basics of the web you can still figure the stuff out in this book on your own on some free recruiting sites 
 Williams' claim is that all porn is not the same, but her book title is very specific which would lead one to believe she will make claims about only hard core and not about the attendant debates over all of porn's place in society.  You have to be suspicious when the majority of reviewers of an academic book have not graduated high school.  I can barely get my university students to read academic writing 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 I read this book before I read her husband Wyatt Cooper's book, which was written decades before Gloria's book. I was confused to find that almost every single one of Gloria's 'memories' of her sons, mostly centering around Carter, obviously, were almost word for word taken from Wyatt Cooper's novel. This makes her book, titled A Mother's Story, so much more sad for me---does Gloria not have any memories about her sons that are her own?  Aside from that,  she spends quite A LOT of the book basically doing the poor little rich girl routine. I'm sure she's had pain in her life, but everyone has! She goes on and on about how she's locked in a bubble and can't feel any real love, everyone that she's ever tried loving is taken from her, etc, etc, etc.   The book is really choppy; short passages taken from her diary, lifted memories, and she jumps back and forth to her son, Carter's suicide. After she describes the suicide she spends the rest of the book going on about how she had to see her surriviving son, Anderson, right in life and then she could be with Wyatt and Carter again. Very melodramtic, but it makes my heart break for Anderson--she quite obviously would rather be 'in heaven with Daddy and Carter' than paying attention to the son she still has.   The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is because it is a mercifully quick read. 
 I don't know whether Seinfeld creator Larry David had A Nos Amours in mind for the mock Eurotrash film that appears in repeated episodes, Rochelle, Rochelle. There are so many French films that could be described as "a young girl's strange erotic journey from Milan to Minsk" - the sexual activities/awakenings of pretty young teenagers is somewhat of a national obsession. It's hard to pick just one.  Maurice Pialat is widely known as "the French Cassavetes" (or, if you are British, "the French Ken Loach") which is the shorthand way of saying he's French, made films on the fringe of the European studio system, imbued his pictures with unsentimental realism, and is well-liked by film snobs who see Pialat's lack of relative mainstream success on these shores as proof of their sophisticated taste. His feature length debut, L'Enfance Nue, was tendered the Francois Truffaut mark of approval (it was produced by the master) as well as a Prix Jean Figo. That award is given each year to a promising French director, generally a young one though Pialat was a forty-four when he got his. He cemented his reputation as un auteur with 1987's Sous le soleil de Satan, which not only won him the Palme d'Or but iconoclast status for life when he flipped off some booing audience members while accepting it. Sounds like a guy I could like.  If only A Nos Amours were a better film.  The picture stars sixteen-year-old Sandrine Bonnaire as the frequently-nude (not as titillating as it sounds) Suzanne, a confused French teenager wandering from one hollow sexual encounter to the next. She says she's only happy when she's in the arms of one of her paramours and we don't blame her: Suzanne's home-life is at best unusual, at worst fairly grotesque. Dad (played by Pialat himself) flies the coop early on, leaving his son, pudgy tyrant Robert (Dominique Besnehard) in charge of both daughter and half-crazy Mom (Evelyne Ker). Emotional and physical abuse relents only for short passages of awkward conversation, often hinging on some sort of inappropriately sexual subject that tinges everything in something akin to unconsummated incest. Mom calls daughter a slut who trades sex advice with Dad while fielding interminable compliments about her body from her brother who himself has become a surrogate husband to Mom. Everyone in this family (Suzanne included) seeks to make life miserable for everyone else, and in their own creepy ways they succeed.  Plenty of women seek the affections of too many men (or too many of the wrong men) to compensate for an absent father - such are the incontrovertible facts that cliché is made of. It's the sort of unsophisticated platitude-masquerading-as-wisdom we've come to expect from daytime talk shows, peddled to prostitutes and cheating spouses. In his own quasi-verité manner, I imagine Pialat was seeking to subvert the cliché, deconstruct it, transcend it - rarely does it actually come off. The meandering quarrels, beatings, and post-coital chit-chats all have the feel of work-shopping actors being put through an exercise rather than real life, even the life of a sexually-obsessed French person. Pialat never truly gets under the surface of these characters, frquently mistaking the bizarre and cruel for honest characterization (it's no surprise Catherine Breillat is such a fan of a the picture). One hundred minutes pass, and yet we still feel as though we do not know these characters - they remain only our acquaintances, obnoxious ones at that, and if it's all the same we rather wish we hadn't been introduced.  Interesting footnote: One of Suzanne's first sexual conquests is an American tourist - we meet him as his has an argument with some French sailors, whom he calls warmongers. This is probably the only time in cinema you will see an American character call a French one a warmonger 
 UPGRADE to 2 1/2 stars. Wordy discussion of historical figures with some relation to algorithms. Little information about any actual algorithms. I retract my previous review (1 star) because that regarded this book as an algorithms book, but it is more of a general interest book that I probably would have liked when I was in highschool 
 After spending hours downloading songs, the player quit on me.  Tried replacing batteries, did all the trouble shooting - nothing.  I purchased it January 30 2007 and it is now past the return to amazon.  Please someone tell me how to get my money back!!! 
 I really tried to get into the letters of Scott and Zelda.  I thought it would broaden my knowledge of this artistic couple and help me to understand their work.  I tried.  I failed.  I just could not get interested in Zelda's shallow world of parties and dances.  I tried skipping to the meatier stuff later in her life; still could not quite muster up the empathy needed to relate to this woman.  Her life was no doubt tragic and sad, but I was not moved.  Perhaps it is heresy to say, but I still am not convinced F Scott is the great American novelist he is marketed to be; the letters in this book did not keep my attention long enough to desire to get to know them better 
 If you look in the dictionary under "turbid," you'll find a photograph of the cover of this book (to intentionally misquote Rodney Dangerfield).  I have an M.A. in philosophy and a long-standing interest in this subject, but if you can learn even one thing from this book, then you're a far more perceptive reader than I.  Recommended only for masochists 
 Item arrived in timely manner, but item appeared used, DVD cases were chipped and broken only one DVD had plastic wrapping 
 When I first purchased the Papermate PhD Multi, I thought, "Wow!" What an awesome instrument. Felt great in the hand and I Iove the flow of the ink. Very smooth. Nice pencil and stylus as bonus!" However, because I liked the pen so much and used it every chance I got, within 3 weeks, the ink cartridge was empty. That's when my love of the pen began to falter. I opened the pen, according to the package instructions, and removed the ink cartridge. However, it never worked the same again. The twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position, so whenever I would bear down to write, it would retract and push up into the pen again.  So, I bought another, thinking I must have done something wrong. Carefully, after the ink ran out in 2 weeks this time (guess I did more writing), I changed the cartridge again. Same thing. At a high price tag ($8-9) for a plastic pen, I bought a third and gave it one more try. Same luck.  So, while I loved the feel and flow of the pen, it is certainly not worth the price tag for a pen whose mechanisms,  housing and construction will only last a month.  Won't buy another one. Three times and you're out. 
 The film was good and I liked the fact that it had cast interviews.  Still, the DVD could have had the making of shaft, deleted scenes and any other extras that come with the making of a movie.  The fact that it didn't was disappointing.  Hopefully one day, there will be a collectors edition of Shaft that will show all that went into concept & making of the movie.  
 If Dr. Damasio is so smart then why doesn't he admit that his thesis  implies phrenology? A: because he knows that it is a pseudoscience 
 I was assigned to read and use this book for a Methods class at CMU. Jackson did a good job of selling the concept of problem frames to me. They seem like a good way to model a system, properly abstracting the problem into distinct interacting segments. It produces diagrams which are helpful as a general architectural overview and are generally largely understandable by non-technical customers. The concept has potential.  Unfortunately, the book does not live up to the concept. The main flaw in the book is found the first time that you need to look up a concept in a prior chapter. Jackson tends to mention a given concept, or a given definition, only once in the book and he uses no way of setting off the concepts and definitions from the rest of the text on the page. Further exacerbating the problem, he makes the cardinal error of software engineers, using common words as his terminology, and redefining them for his purposes. Not only does this mean that his terms don't stand out from the text, but this also means that the reader will be forced to puzzle out whether Jackson is referring to "machine" as a term within his framework, or simply referring to the dictionary definition of a machine.  It's not all bad. Jackson does have a friendly conversational style to his writing that turned me on to the concept while reading the chapters the first time. Unfortunately, the reread entirely turned me off 
 Although I read this book a year or two ago, I recently received it for Christmas and decided to look at the reviews, because frankly, I thought it was a terrible book. First, the main character's family is so superstitious that it seems unrealistic. After she "causes her sister's infertility," she paddles down a river, and frankly, the rest was so boring, I forgot what happens next. 
 After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.   Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.  Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.    As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.    I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated 
 O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS.  O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message?  He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree. The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor.  He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!)  He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself. 
 This is the sort of guy who sees a woman win a big settlement for spilling coffee in her lap and concludes that all lawsuits against corporations are frivolous.  As for Al Gore, he's no more a scientist than Milloy and no thinking person should take either too seriously.  They both tell people what they want to hear.  But would you rather err on the side of side of caution or go with a guy who thinks DDT got a bum rap?  Mr. Milloy is playing a sucker's game.  Pick anything that's happens slowly, then deny, deny, deny, figuring, if you're wrong, you won't be around, so who cares? 
 I agree with most of the negative reviewers about this, especially the one who pointed out that there were no "Mysteries". The criticisms are quite accurate: the tone is glib, condescending and jocular, what could be called Best Seller/talk show host prose: nothing too strenuous or meaningful. Bill Maher does the High Middle Ages. This is certainly the prevalent view: "nowadays, we know all about it". There is no sense of humility before a subject no one human could possibly understand nor of the feelings evoked by the great works of art of the era, compared to which the 20th century had very little.   
 ORDERED MORE THAN A MONTH AGO, I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AND SCHOOL ALREADY STARTED!!! 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 Yeah, right. Have you ever seen such bogus drivel as the fake reviews posted here by the publisher 
 I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes. 
 I know why the guy on the cover of this CD is crying: he was forced to listen to it.  I gotta tell ya, I'm not a fan of The Nickelback.  The first time I heard that song "How You Remind Me" I thought it was some kind of joke.  Well, if it was a joke, it's now five years later and I still don't get it.  Can you please explain to me why anyone would want to hear some guy with really bad hair blather on about some nonsense, then say "Yeah!" like 50 million times?  To borrow a line from Billy Madison, "I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. 
 Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot 
 The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something 
 Overrated; slapstick; stupid. This movie gives "gay" a black eye. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch men dress like women and act like female dogs, then you will probably really love this movie. Honestly, you have better things to do with your time...and there are much better gay movies out there.  Try Maurice or Brokeback Mountain 
 The book is about leading a company, not about the law of attraction. Although it may be a fine book for entrepreneurs, it is not a book on philosophy 
 While I will concede that the book is an easy read, it does talk down to the child and the book constantly contradicts itself. One example from the book: Women and children in the South were not use to doing things for themselves. Then showing children with barefoot.  If a child is rich enough to not "do" for himself he would not be barefoot as only poor people were barefooted in those days. Secondly very few people in the South actually owned slaves, something the book doesn't make clear. The issue for many Southerners wasn't slavery as much as taxes. Like a pervious reviewer I wish the book covered Sherman's march to Sea which an effort by the Union Army to just target the Southern Civilian population. I also wish the book was be more accurate and stated that the Northern Army didn't treat former slaves well either.  The sad part that the book didn't bring out was the fact that during reconstruction there was little to no schooling allowed for children whose fathers served in the Rebel Army. 
 I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over 
 120 thread count is never a good choice. This set feels more like 20 thread count. I ended up using the fitted sheet as a box spring cover and made curtains out of the flat sheet. Don't buy this 
 This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, "The Wander" suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on "The Wander" as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, "The Man", or "The Fuzz" are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up 
 G.P. Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy "Shadowmancer." And the follow-up, "Wormwood," is even less engaging than "Shadowmancer" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.    In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and then it stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.     This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...    Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.    One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.    Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments, and some truly bizarre theology. Can angels drown?    The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing. Tegatus the depressed angel is just freakin' boring.    G.P. Taylor strikes out again with "Wormwood," another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Boring, messy, and not worth the effort it takes to wade through 
 I tried to read this book, I really did but please Daffyd you could really do more with this book. I have had trouble reading other books before but I am a pretty open person and usually manage to finish them. However I  couldn't even get halfway through this book, it was that terrible. Still,  everyone is different, don't let my silly ramblings, dissuade you from  buying this book you may like it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained 
 This film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, Pride and Prejudice.  It represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and Austen novels; however, it is not great in terms of adaptation.  If you love Pride and Prejudice and have never seen this film, skip it.  It will only anger you.  If you're studying film adaptation of Austen novels, you MUST see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards.  AND--it's Laurence Olivier, afterall 
 The book is full of pie in the sky mentality and ideals as seen through rose colored glasses. 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 This book was required reading for a class I took on Russian Art and Architecture, and I assure you that if it wasn't required I would not have wasted my time. I feel that Gray's writing is dense, boring, and difficult to understand. She often includes images that she does not discuss or that she discusses in totally different parts of the book, leaving the reader to constantly flip through the book and piece together information in a totally inefficient way. I feel like better organization would have made this book more reader-friendly 
 This is a movie that starts out nowhere, and for 95 minutes takes you further than any nowhere you ever dreamed of.  Unimaginative, lacking in humor, and a senseless plot, The Good Girl is definitely a movie for anyone who loves other bad, nonsensical current movies like Crash.  Jennifer Aniston plays a new version of Rachel, and the writing is just awful.  The only good thing about this movie is Zooey Deschanel, but then, Zooey can sparkle like a diamond in any old trash heep 
 This version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the DVD and listed in the IMDb.  I saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again, but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie.  The DVD packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by Amazon.  They made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done.  I do not recommend this version to anyone.  The orginal movie deserves better than this chop job 
 I agree with the other review, just mundane chit chat. I wonder if the author has ever been in the back office of a real restaurant 
 I never write reviews for anything, but this one was so bad, I couldn't help myself. Everybody has different tastes, but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all, you will not like Belladonna. I could not make sense of it at all, it rambled on and on, never getting to the point, never picking a path, never building on a theme. It bored me with it's vague attempts to build a song. I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me. I felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed. Good Luck on your listing adventures 
 If I had saved the box I would have returned this product. The head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked. And it wasnt just one shower I tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mi 
 Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received.  I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04.  Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time 
 Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 My expectations were high but this is just a poorly written book.  About half the narrative is about the characters who joined the Rough Riders.  Very little of the book deals with the battles in Cuba and the sections that do make the exploits of the Rough Riders seem grossly over rated.  Roosevelt seems to write withh the intent on securing his place in history.  And, if that wasn't enough, he includes self-serving appendices that laud his conduct on the battlefield and support his yearning for the medal of honor. I found his writing style tedious and often repetitious--you'll encounter countless references to the smokeless ammunition used by the Spanish.  Enough already 
 I read this book with great interest because research on counsiousness has still a long way to go. After reading books like Dennet, Counciousness Explained and Phantom Limb of Ramachadran I think this book is a little bit of an old fashioned repeat. Even when you keep in mind that above mentioned books are from the same date of publishing. I would recommend this book for younger with litte knowlidge on this subject 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 I bought this book thinking that there was some secret "neural" or "linguistic" programming (like a certain set of instructions) I could follow to gain some sort of advantage in life, and what I got was just a lot of the same self-help stuff that seems to have been already covered by many others.  The "technology" is really just learning how to think of things differently; particularly negative things that drag you down.  There are also some ideas related to communications and establishing repoir with others that could come in handy.  That said, precious little in this book struck me as being "new".  And to add bewilderment to my dissappointment there were also two particularly logic defying ideas that form the foundation of this "technology".  First, "Every behavior is useful in some context".   Hmmm, this was written in 1994.  Did having a bunch of fanatics fly airliners into the World Trade Center maybe cause this presupposition to come into question?  Second, "If one person can do something, anyone can learn to do it."    That's right.  One person figured out that mass equals energy times the speed of light squared, and so anyone could learn to figure out the profound principles that govern our universe.  If one person can design a microprocessor chip, anyone can learn to.  If one person can compose a recording like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts" or "Pet Sounds", then anyone can learn to.  If one person can carve a statue of David out of marble (who did that again?), anyone can learn to!  I could be a nuclear physicist, a computer engineering genious, a  classical music composer, an opera star, a nobel prize winning economist --you name it -- simply because someone else did!   Brilliant.   Well, I gotta cut this short because today I'm writing a bestselling novel, recording the next great love song, and designing an ion-propulsion engine for space travel.  After all, one person has done those things.  I can learn to do them too.   Seriously, I gave this book two stars instead of one because if the reader has geniunely never been introduced to some of the thought pattern changing techniques in this book, then he or she could actually benefit from reading it.  I could probably stand a little more "inner alignment" myself.   
  How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender?  The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S.  An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position.  Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work?  The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways.  
 Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book 
 My boss ordered this book in hopes that it would be helpful in preparing for "fun" improv activities at a summer camp he will be teaching at. Unfortunately, this book was dry and boring... the scenes suggested  were not something that would keep any child of any age interested... they  were simply rehashes of situations that pop up in every day life. If you're  looking for fun and games, this book isn't for you 
 not nearly as good as I was hoping.  i'm not sure i would even define the music as part of the same genre as "night at the playboy mansion".  much more drum and trance feel.. 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 This is a somewhat useful book for those who accept the highly- sensitive-person designation.  Ms. Jaeger provides some helpful advice, though a fair bit is so general as to render it almost useless. Also, I think even she is aware that there are many cases in which people with family obligations simply cannot afford to leave dull, menial, and wearisome jobs, however soul-destroying such work might be. Ms. Jaeger's book deserved a much more careful editing. It is full of grammatical errors, most glaringly--pronoun-reference problems and needless repetition, which frequently obstruct the message. I appreciate the efforts of the author to tackle the subject, but the book ought to have been much shorter and more finely-tuned. A good editor should have assisted her with this 
 I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it 
 My view is skewed.  I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve Çoonts a few times as a B/N.  His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye.  People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it.  Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin.  While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book.  So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try. W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71 
 The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty 
 One of the curiosities of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" is that the main character is not "Julius Caesar", who is killed early in the play, nor Marc Antony, who has by far the best and most famous speech - "Friends,Romans, countrymen, ...".     The central character is Brutus, the "noblest Roman of them all", who must balance his his duty toward Rome against his loyalty to Caesar.  Brutus is a follower of the Stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals, rather than being lead by his emotions.  It seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having Jason Robards, a highly skilled actor, deliver all Brutus's lines in a bored flat undertone.  I wonder how they persuaded him to do it?       "Don't act Jason.  Trust us.  Just read the lines off slowly             like you never saw them before and you don't care a pin.     It'll be great.!"     To say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement. Mr. Spock has a wider emotional range.  They would have done better and saved money by having Brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the HAL 9000.  When Brutus is off screen the movie is fine.  Heston is surprisingly good.  Gielgud is great. It is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes, the cheap sets, the worst fake beard in the history of cinema. If you want to see a much better film version, there is the classic black and white version in whcih James Mason and Sir John Gielgud make a superb pair as Brutus and Casius, and  Marlon Brando gives a chilling Antony.  As for this one, if someone gives it to you as a present, by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library 
 If you have any respect for the blues legend, don't buy this, don't even rent it. The very few decent tribute performances do not make up for the lack of content in this DVD. Pointless interviews and speeches make for annoying filler, when all we really want is the music. Especially disappointing is the performance by Weir/Wasserman. They rattle off a an aimless and depthless "Walkin' Blues" You can't help but feel that Wasserman would rather be somewhere else. Most irritating is the claim that this so-called conference "found" a "very rare" film clip of the man himself. It is presented to a lecture-hall audience, to which Robert Johnson's son was a part. When asked by the speaker if the man playing guitar was indeed Robert Johnson, he said clearly:"No." "Ummm...are you sure?"  "YES!" "Oh...well, so it may not be him, but is certainly LOOKS like him..." Why was this even included here? If it's NOT footage of Robert Johnson, then why didn't it wind up on the cutting room floor? Bleah 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
 I was disappointed: the book repeats the same advice found in all older books ("Don't go for the sweet sickly kitten"), without adding something new. It repeated the old misconception that tortie toms are infertile. Being a breeder, I had hoped on a section on kittening, birth, but no such luck.   I may have missed some gems because I could not bring myself to read it any further .. The only reason to buy *this* one instead of another cat/kitten book, is the dummies-lay out. But that sacrifices the pictures that otherwise get included.   After having seen the same old (but sound, that's true) advice repeated, with the same old misinformation - anybody wants this book? Mine's up for sale! 
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 This book contains case studies from various data mining software. It does not contain any specific theory or practical examples for implementing a web analytics strategy for your site.  90% of the case studies he uses in his book are related to companies which their sites no longer exist.   I find this book very outdated and the examples the author use are related to visits on site, their age and country of origin. He doesn't mention anything about visitor site navigiation, trends or anything related to the visitor behaviour on site.  I wish i never bought this book because it costed me $80 due to courrier fees.  
 I rented this DVD so I could finally watch the game that I missed a year ago, which my parents were supposed to tape for me but they didn't.  I was severely disappointed because it only shows a few highlights and not the whole game.  I need to find a copy of the whole game somewhere so I can finally watch it.  I've been a Steeler fan for 28 years, and this was a long time in coming.  I didn't see it because I don't watch television on the Lord's Day.  There are more important things to do on that day 
 Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target.  His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering. While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic.  "We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people," he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms.  Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince.  His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls "media culture" and other left-wing "evils." Political hackwork.  
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it.  In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you.  I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe. 
 I had bought a copy of Harold Evans "The American Century" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives. 
 It's too bad that this particular philosophy has overtaken the whole of western civilization.  By Hobbes' philosophy the heart of christianity is ejected in favor of reason guided by fear to avoid a state called war against every man.  But to accomplish this he somehow accepts "do unto others as you would do to you", an old christian maxim.  Since the whole point is to avoid a state of war, all he does is create a way around it.  So all we get in order to avoid war is a bunch of fearful and weak people scared to do anything to anyone else - let everyone do what they want as long as they don't hurt you physically.  Because if everyone is fearful and weak, then no one will want war.  But why is a state of war so bad.  Maybe that's what we need so that we're not such a bunch of wusses.  Is there any wonder why feminists are the most masculine in our society.  All we are composed of now is a bunch of weenies.  We need to eject this state of weakness in favor of a state of war, because this will create strong superior people.  It sounds bad, but its not my fault 
 I could only get through the first two chapters before I snorted with laughter.  It just seems very anti-French, which is slightly amusing and terrible at the same time.  Since I was amused, I gave it two stars instead of one.  I knew this book was bad news when I first saw it in a grocery store, but I was tempted anyway.  Oh well.  Ugh 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 The highlights of this book: - factual errors - irrational layout - practice tests that don't remotely resemble the real thing. Don't buy it 
 Went to see this movie at the IMAX in San Antonio this weekend.  I have to say I actually laughed most of the way through.  The effects were decent, but most of the time I had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3D effects.  That was when I wasn't having to "look around" the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie.  Some of the torture scenes and the Faustian plotline, along with the hideous firey face that is Mr. D make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10, but the terrible plot along with the worst voice-acting I have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10.  Basically, I guess you could say I was slightly displeased with the movie.  I do have to admit that I got a hearty laugh when the main character, Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, an up-and-coming rocker and lead singer of the band Arid, a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot I could find in the movie) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil Mr. D and destroy the haunted castle.  Unfortunately, the scene was designed to be serious 
 This was not my favorite or most useful book for when I set out to homestead. Although it has a lot of good information in it, it is too dense and hard to read through, and too hard to find info immediately as I need it. I read it occasionally, but found the Storey books much more useful for practical, look-it-up-now information. 
 I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I watched Crank.  I used to be a Jason Statham fan, but now I find myself not so sure.  He was great in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and The Transporter.  But this... This was just one guy's excuse to put complete junk in a movie.  Let's just say that the "highlight" of the movie was the main character and his girlfriend going at it in the middle of Chinatown.  And by the middle of Chinatown, I mean, on top of a newspaper stand surrounded by 50 people of Asian descent.  It was like a train wreck:  awful, but I couldn't look away.  But when you find yourself asking "why did he have to take off his underwear to put on that hospital gown", you're watching the wrong movie.  Spare yourself and rent something else. 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 There is no doubt that the alluring vocals and accompanying music are exemplary on this compilation CD. I am a diehard Micheal Franks fan bit I am far different than his light-jazz, lovers' music fan base. Michael Franks is a very profound and intelligent artist who personally cares deeply about the state of the world. To me his best songs are about loss, dejection, optimism, death and when he addresses world issues. However, his love songs seem to exclusively appeal to upper-class lovers and married couples. Only Paul McCartney can overcome such sappiness because he is the master of melodic music. I pray that that the extremely talented Michael Franks will make a real serious album that addresses the world of strife and danger that we live in. For example, a Green agenda. Franks is a vegetarian, wildlife guardian, environmentalist and animal welfare proponent! Our world of global warming, war, species extinctions and universal suffering is a veil of tears not a haven for love songs! 
 This book is not as good as i thought it would be.  I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling 
 I liked the first half of this book, but towards the end things started to go terribly wrong.  I began to feel terribly sorry for Genny, and even though I knew things were out of Alec's hands, his behavior to the end  seemed inexcusable.  Horribly mean.  Didn't like it at all 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 Here is the short version.   Oct05  I bought a Fujifilm Finepix F460 digital camera for $299.99.   Nov06  Camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating  bright/dark horizonal strips across them.   Jan07  I sent the camera in to Fujifilm's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires.   Jan07  The service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 (I spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if I accepted).   Feb07  I contacted the service center and stated that I think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse. And that I don't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired. The service rep, named Christina, asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do. I complied.   Mar07  Fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that I did not reply to the estimate.   Now  I will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera, its memory card, and the shipping I paid.  
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 I had to read this book as a freshman in college in 1985 (it's since been updated). The professor offered an A to anyone who read it five times--so I did! As a result, I was stunted intellectually for several years, before I finally learned about some basic economic fallacies.   Parenti's book, which is little more than propaganda, is one long string of economic fallacies. For example, one of his favorite arguments is that just a few people, corporations, etc, in the US own most of the assets and property. He never stops to ask the question: So what? What follows? This is only self-evident proof of injustice if economic exchange is a zero-sum game, so that if one person gains five dollars, then someone, somewhere, lost five dollars.   But everything we know about economics refutes the assumption. Wealth is created. The fact that the outcomes of wealth are unevenly distributed proves nothing, especially since many of the individuals and companies with the most wealth are the very same individuals and companies that create the most wealth.  By missing such simple distinctions, this book should only be persuasive to colleged freshmen who are blissfully ignorant of economic fallacies. And someone of those freshmen will do what I did: they will keep reading, and figure out how out of touch Parenti is. I doubt Parenti imagined his agitprop would backfire, and produce conservatives who don't like to be propagandized 
 I was barely able to finish this book. Armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. This made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. I might have been able to swallow the idea of Cabals (giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just take over the world and have done), but Armstrong really lost me during the 20-page extended send-up of Anne Rice's vampires. This genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and Armstrong is the worst culprit. In Industrial Magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. On top of that, the viewpoint character, Paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. Her central relationship is with her boyfriend, Lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. Are we supposed to think this is cute and funny?   Take-home project for Armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine emotion into your work 
 This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.     The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.   
 A beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting. Russell Crowe shouldn't try the Hugh Grant shtick! The movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into Hollywood's story template mire. Hollywood won't take any chances, it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over. Hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises, are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before. You know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes. The only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and Albert Finney's performance. He commands your attention, fills the screen with his acting. A superb performance. Many have said it is the new "French Kiss". Though the story lines are similar, the direction and character development in "French Kiss" was much better. Kevin Kline's acting and character development were excellent. If you want to see this genre done really well, watch the film "Mostly Martha" directed and written by Sandra Nettelbeck. No, it's not about Martha Stewart. "A Good Year" would have been a much better film in her hands 
 if you are looking for an irish name spelled in gaelic, this is your book.  if you are hard-up for a romanian name for your little one, this is your book.  if you are looking for a "normal," pronouceable name, you'd do better looking elsewhere.    yes, this book has a billion names in it, but well over half are utterly unusable--seriously.  either you cannot pronounce them (see above referenced gaelic names) or they are just plain off the charts weird.  we have this book and while i flipped through it a few times, mostly we made fun of the names in it. 
 Nothing much to say exept Worst movie I've evere seen. I'd recommend Cat. 6 Day of destruction! 
 Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America 
 It's about a young man who lives in Mississippi town with his mentally ill aunt. His cousin (not his aunt's daughter) is in love with him and they do (or did) have a sexual relationship. Here come Lee Todd into town and wants to rent his cottage. There is homosexual tension between the two of them but neither acknowledges it.  A snarky side of me wants to call this "Brokeback Swamp" but this film is more Southern Gothic and a B film at best. It's slow moving and nothing much happens. Avoid this film.  
 Book four in the series featuring Temperance Brennan finds her working on a plane crash in North Carolina that has attracted media attention from across the country.  The plane was transporting mostly college athletes on their way to a competition, but also carried a Canadian police officer escorting a criminal back to Canada.  Speculation runs wild during the search for how and what caused the plane to explode and crash.  However, Tempe finds a foot in the woods not far from the crash site that she believes was not a part of the crash or the remains of anyone on the plane.  This discovery leads her to investigate what she believes to be a complicated set of murders that appear to be linked, but do not seem to make sense.  As she gets closer to the truth Tempe finds that she is up against much more than she ever suspected, including high ranking political officials that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets from the public.    The problem with this installment is that it never gets particularly exciting.  There is some mystery and intrigue, but Tempe continues to be a weak heroine and so it is not easy to get behind her and excited in her super sleuthing.  Additionally, it is hard to believe that an anthropologist would find herself given so much high level access and status related to crime scenes and investigation.    Overall, this series is on the dull side and so there is not enough excitement to overcome the unbelievable aspects of the plot.  There just is not enough "hook" to keep me loyal or to continue reading 
 I wasn't mad at anyone, but the angel wasn't good. He was so downbeat and sparkling. ROAR. Habila's better write "Doctor Ice Cream," a masterpiece, before I forgive him 
 Part of the Introduction came out immediately as if it were never attached.  This shouldn't happen on a "Like New" book.  I enjoy the book but the condition is wholly unacceptable.  No other pages have fallen out, however 
 This particular model is simply unsuitable for use, as the girth of this glass is too large to hold securely. Although impressive visually, the execution of this glass is poor as it is impractical for use safely and comfortably. As an owner of many of the Sommeliers series glasses from Riedel, the "O" Chardonnay glass is a blatant disappointment. This selection will be returned to the seller 
 My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious. 
 I found the book extremely helpful and am very grateful for the sharing of professional tips and techniques.  The author takes great pains to tell us that all the chefs she encountered at the CIA emphasised how important it is to measure all ingredients by weight rather than volume (cups).  Then, what do we find, but the recipes are all in cups with no weights offered!  How will the cooking/baking culture ever change if even this book does not practice what it preaches?  
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 Oh Dear!! When a reveiw starts with Oh Dear then you just know the movie went bad. I waited and hoped  this film would be released, I'd heard so much about it. This was one of the most horrific  movies banned under the video nasty craze. I think it was banned because it was plain rubbish. DO NOT BUY, Its pretty bad but if your like me your gonna buy it anyway. Get some beer and watch it if you have to 
 bottom of the barrel action with one of dolgh lundgren's worst preformances(so you know it must be really bad) as a soviet officer sent to kill an african leader. when he gets there he changes sides and helps the african people against the soviets.     sounds much better than it really is ,the action is flat as is the whole movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! skip it!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book is nothing but a shameful and disguised attempt (notwithstanding his denials) to discredit Democratic voters and to advocate the enactment of "election reform" laws that will disenfranchise voters, while at the same time ignore and dismiss the greatest threat to our democracy today - the privatization of our elections with corporate owned electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software and leave no paper trail for auditing them.  To be more specific:  The book is filled with purported examples of illegal voters, ignoring the fact that this problem accounts for a small minority of election fraud in our country today.  To remedy this problem, Fund advocates several measures that will do little to remedy the problem, while disenfranchising millions of voters, mostly those who are poor or non-white and most likely to vote Democratic.  Here are just three examples, among the many cited in Funds book: 1) Disallowing homeless people to vote because they don't have a proper address; 2) Requiring a picture ID to vote - which 10% of the population lack, and which amounts to a poll tax for the poor; 3) Abolishing the extending of voting hours in situations where insufficient allocation of voting machines results in as long as 10 hour waits to vote (again, this is a problem faced mainly in poor and minority neighborhoods).     But whereas Fund is so concerned that an occasional illegal voter may slip through the cracks in our system, when it comes to electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software, although admitting that mistakes are sometimes made, he claims that these machines cannot be used to steal elections.  To prove this point he does nothing more than quote a man who works as a PR consultant for Diebold - although Fund is Careful not to mention this fact.      
 The above quote is from the short story LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AS A DICTATOR WOULD TELL IT, wherein the wolf explains how he was the real victim, and Little Red and Granny had it coming.  THE VAMPIRE LESTAT is a bit like an irony-free book-long version of the same thing.    This is, of course, the sequel to INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, which did not need or want a sequel.  For fans of the first book, the opening pages of TVL will tell you right away what you are in for.  Louis was lying.  Lestat is really a lovely guy, he never kills anybody who doesn't deserve it.  Heck, even when he is starving, he goes without blood until he can find a killer who shows no remorse.  He is not a peasant named Valois, he is a nobleman named  "de Lioncourt".  Yeah, that's the ticket.     You might reasonably assume that Lestat - the narrator -- is the one doing most of the lying, but the epilogue makes clear that this is not the case. Nor do we get a convincing Lestat's-eye portrait of Louis-As-Liar, or any decent (or even lame) reason why Louis would tell a pack of lies to a mortal anyway, so don't be like me and plow your way through the whole book if that is the part you are interested in.  This is a lazy retcon, not RASHOMON.    Pity.  Ms. Rice has the beginnings of a very good story here.  Lestat is the unhappy younger son of a backwoods nobleman in pre-Revolutionary France, and he finds solace in his friendship with Nicolas, a cultured but rebellious merchant's son with a dark streak.  Their passionate attachment despite vast chasms of psychological difference provides an excellent beginning to the novel, and gives us characters and themes we can actually care about.  This historical setting is well realized, and the wolves are cool, as is the Little Red Riding Hood motif.    Unfortunately, even in this first and best part of the novel, the boy Lestat is overshadowed by his egomaniac alter ego. His mortal innocence has a hard time making an impression through the filter of modern-day narrator-Lestat's banality and self-absorption.  Only occasionally, when young Lestat feels hurt by his brother's coldness, or moved by his friend's affection or pain, do we get a FEEL for his imperiled humanity. Most times, such as when he spends half a page describing how his own mouth looked, we only feel that he must have been a soulless prat from the cradle.  Further, he becomes a vampire too soon, and adjusts too easily, leaving us no reason to like him at all.    The pre-whitewashed monster from INTERVIEW was, ironically, far more human, in that his very cruelty was evidence of his desperate dependency.  Compare him to THIS idiot, who constantly spouts glib and flowery declarations of "love" for anyone and anything he gets briefly enthusiastic about, including the people he murders. I spent INTERVIEW nursing a slow burning hatred for Lestat, and rooting for him to die a hideous death, but he was a genuinely tragic character in his own way.  This guy isn't worth the effort of either hate or pity.  I just wanted him put out of my misery.      I agree with the reviewer who said that this would have been a much better book if it only had been about "The Vampire George" rather than Lestat.  Not only does TVL trash classic characters from a better book, but since this is all just backstory to INTERVIEW, nothing interesting can actually GO anywhere.  Lestat's friendship with Nicolas and feud with Armand, which signified so much about the spiritual trauma of that time, should have been the heart and soul of this novel.  But both are neglected in favor of Lestat's dreary Oedipal relationship with his mother, and then dropped so we can have a search for the Origin of Vampires.  The latter is a bit like reading a novel about an angst-ridden serial child-killer, only to have it end with him tracing his family tree back to Genghis Khan.  Who cares?  As Louis finally admitted at the end of INTERVIEW about his similar quest, it is just avoiding the point.   But that attitude would only kill the opportunity for more sequels, I suppose.     So eventually we meet a NEW Louis, who has clearly received a partial lobotomy, a spine-ectomy, and an all-expense-paid trip to Stepford since the ending of INTERVIEW, instead of killing himself like he said he would, the Rotten Stinking Liar.  But he still looks ravishing, and that's what counts.   So forget  "You cannot have love and goodness when you do what you know to be evil" or "I knew the real answer to my quest . . . when I first took a human life to feed my craving.  It was my death."    Instead we get a flock of swishy yet murderous fiends gazing lovingly upon one another and rhapsodizing at length about each other's mesmerizing beauty.  "Locked together in hatred" looks darn good by comparison. 
 Looks great but don't get trusted, this is the worst killer shark film ever! The shark looks so fake and during all the movie he only killed like 4 people and that's it. So please don't see this movie I'm warning you 
 It does not bother me when a self-help book presents itself as such and simply offers advice to its readers.  But it bothers me greatly when a "pop" psychology book pretends to base its conclusions on "scientific" evidence when in reality its conclusions are based on nothing more than flimsy anecdotes.    If you are the sort of reader that thinks anecdotal "evidence" is sufficient, then you'll probably like this book on "How a Man's Mind Really Works" (the subtitle).  But you will be fooled into thinking you're learning something new.  Here is a sample of the sort of "evidence" the author provides (or does not provide):  1. "Over the past twenty years I have been researching male and female biology . . ." (p. 270).  What, where, and when has he published?  Nothing of his "research" is cited, either here or in any other book I own on sex differences.  The author wants the veneer of scientific cover but fails to provide anything of substance for his assertions.  2. As a reference for his assertions regarding "The Biology of Commitment,"  he cites only Janet Evanovich's novel,"Two for the Dough." If that doesn't make you LOL, you are not acquainted with the amazing Stephanie Plum (who has not yet added "biological research" to her list of accomplishments). I've never before seen a supposedly non-fiction book cite fictional characters as evidence for its assertions! Have you? What does this tell you about the author's attitude toward his readers?   3. The author writes, "Supporting anecdotes and stories from individuals who have lived out biological trends are crucial, I believe, to the understanding of the male brain.  When we put hard sciences together with soft, then combine these sciences with diverse life stories, we can investigate the mysteries of a subject--in our case, the male mind--with greater confidence." (p. xix)      What does "individuals who have lived out biological trends" mean? [individuals who are alive? who were alive?].  The fact is that the "hard science" in this book is minimal: the brain structures and functions the author mentions have been known for the past 30 years.  His new "evidence" consists of stories that illustrate his preconceptions.  There is just enough of the male stereotype to provoke an "AHA!" reaction in some readers. But what percentage of men do NOT fit any particular stereotype?  Alas, the author never raises and thus does not answer such a profound question.  He's too busy with his "neurobiological research," I guess.  4. The author's sole "credentials" consist of being the author of prior pop psychology books.  His educational background is not provided.  Although he refers to himself as a "family therapist," he provides no evidence that he is licensed to practice.  He is not a member of the American Psychological Association.      If you are looking for a well-written book that contains actual scientific evidence of male-female differences, I suggest Simon Baron-Cohen's "The Essential Difference."    
 I ordered this book based on Mr. Sullivan's review in part.  I thought it was my favorite silly book from childhood, the one that has "I am silly, you are silly, all of us are silly, Willy, all of us but cousin  Tilly...." etc.  But NO!  This book is a Picture Book with Silly  pictures.  I might call it "a silly book" but I wouldn't call it  "THE silly book."  For young kids 
 I bought this movie set for my nephew and have to say that I was unpleasantly suprised to hear the language used in this "Cartoon".  Fine if your child is 13 and you don't mind, but NOT for little ones 
 The author has developed an interesting world: there are parallel realms populated by magic and non-magic beings (ranging from plain humans to dragons), an interesting magic system (with levels, but also specialized castes), a decent-sized cast. Unfortunately the trilogy suffers from lots of problems that are impossible to ignore when stumbling over them many times in hundreds of pages. Note that this review may contain spoilers.  First there's the rampant overuse of 'taboo' subjects like S&M, rape, incest and pedophilia - it's not innovative, daring or edgy, just unrealistically widespread and pointless. Consider that in the first half of the trilogy, two of the three leading men are continuously being 'punished' by excruciating pain from rings attached to their sexual organs, the female protagonist lives in a children's mental hospital visited by 'uncles' who rape and kill the occupants (without the families ever noticing), the evil witch has intercourse with children - including her own son, another main female character was produced when her mother was violated (later killed), there's some father-daughter incest in the family of the female protagonist, and it just goes on and on and on. The second half of the trilogy is a bit more restrained in this regard, but still treats us to some real gems in this department.  The trilogy also suffers from a typical fantasy problem: excessively powerful characters. This problem is however enhanced by the most asymmetric distribution of power between good and evil I've ever seen.  The magic system consists of 13 different power levels, symbolized by colored jewels - the darker the color, the more powerful (black being the most powerful). A black-jeweled individual is powerful enough to destroy a good part of a city and kill/disable hundreds or thousands of weaker individuals in one outburst of power. Somebody is considered to have basically no chance when fighting a person with a darker jewel. Given this, consider the power distribution in the book: on the evil side, there are two red-jeweled witches (level 10) and for the rest the obligatory cannon fodder. On the good side, we have the only two black-jeweled men (Saetan and Daemon, level 13) and the only black-jeweled woman in the world, two level 12 men (also the only ones in the world), one level 11 woman, a dragon with undefined tremendous power (who never uses it) and the main female protagonist - Jaenelle. Jaenelle has, as a child, the power equivalent to dozens of regular black-jeweled persons. When she grows up, she goes to a previously unknown level that is darker than black; according to Daemon her power is the equivalent of *thousands* of black-jeweled men, making her probably more powerful than the rest of the world put together. Just to top it off, at the end of the book she gets yet another special power level created, just for her, though we are not told what that level actually means.  By the second half of the trilogy, we have all this effectively infinite power (plus the cannon fodder that on the good side is actually roughly the strength as the evil witches) gathered in one place, yet somehow unable to eradicate the wimpy evil. Hazard a guess as to what damage all the good power causes in the first 95% of the book... it makes the two evil witches ugly. Yep, that's it. The ridiculousness of this situation is emphasized by the fact that Saetan has a red-jeweled *butler* - in other words, the guy who opens the door and brings the coffee on the good side is as strong as the strongest evil character.  Third are the unrealistic characters: everyone is incredibly handsome, infinitely rich if they need money (we are told Daemon pays a 2 mln gold coin bribe and could do it again if necessary and he even owns a secret private island somewhere - all of that achieved with secret investments while being a pleasure slave?!), extremely powerful (see above), telepathic, has the ability to transport him-/herself over vast distances using 'the webs' or gates and several of the characters have the ability to resist and produce poison as well as interpret the future or heal dangerous injuries. In fact the super-rich Daemon is so drop-dead gorgeous and hot that he can satisfy women sexually - yet leave them longing for more for days afterward - just by looking at them.   The difference between good and evil is that the good ones are very nice, caring, sentimental and wimpy, while the evil ones are stupidly backstabbing evil and love S&M.  For example on the good side we have Saetan, black-jeweled, natural Black Widow, 50000 years old High Lord of Hell and High Priest of the Hourglass (sounds tough and impressive, right?) who we see giving a foot massage to some other guy, and whining about wanting to borrow a romance novel. All guys on the good side are douchebags and almost all women annoying spoilt brats.  On the evil side the two witches continue to come up with all kinds of small, stupid plans to get Jaenelle in their power. A plan fails? No matter, kill the one responsible and go to the next stupid plan lined up. Not unlike Pinky and The Brain - I was waiting for "Gee, what do you want do to tonight?" "Same thing we do every night, try to take over the world.". In the end they *almost* get the obvious idea (war), but that doesn't quite work out because they get distracted by a pathetic kidnapping scheme that's doomed to fail. Frustratingly stupid really. The only thing that's more stupid is that the infinitely powerful Jaenelle spends most of her time in the book being completely exhausted and emaciated due to dealing with side-effects of these plans or her own incompetence - however stupid and transparent the plan, Jaenelle is going to almost-but-not-quite die or lose her powers fighting it.   Fourth problem is that the language chosen by the author makes suspense of disbelief difficult. There's repetition (humans snarling, 'males' versus 'females', fruitless attempts of the super-powerful to get drunk (they usually can't because they're so damn powerful), continuous complaints about how exasperating this or that is), words that simply don't fit in a fantasy setting (powerful wizards/warlords over and over again referred to as "boyos", shopping sprees), unrealistic amenities (running hot and cold water, the presence of a "Dr." who is in charge of the mental hospital - while medicine is in all other cases done by Healers with no academic title), Bond-like gadgets (manufactured by the super-powerful Jaenelle in the second half of the book).  Last but not least, the world is not properly explained. In time, you do get an idea of how it's organized, but as the purpose of the book is not to let you puzzle on this, it should be explained beforehand, or in an appendix or whatever. The scale of the world is also not clear: characters effectively jump between places (because they're so powerful and can travel "the webs" - we have no idea at what speed this is or how long it takes in most cases) and between parallel realms - they don't ever walk or use a horse for more than two miles or so. Jaenelle knows just about everyone in the book and just about everyone knows who she is and adores her on the first meeting (unless they're evil). The result is that the Black Jewels universe feels very small and claustrofobic.  Two stars for the idea, half a star for the writing style. Rounded down because I think it's very overrated at this point 
 I purchased this book in the expectation that it would expand on FMP's online help.  However, I was disappointed in that it only covers the basics, doesn't add to what's available in FMP's online help.  Index insufficient to quickly access information sought.  Lacks sufficient examples of applications 
 Editorial Reviews  Amazon.com essential video After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi   Product Description Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi 
 Are we all mad???? No really?   This is a nice book.   Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost?   The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings.   It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune.   It is the content which is valuable not the coverings.  Sorry to be so negative.   Blessed be 
 I grew up with this story - what happened?!  Somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors.  Kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled - and you can't pawn something as poorly done as this off on them.  They're smarter than that!  I could've done a better job in my garage.  "Under the bridge lived a troll..."  Come on 
 I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's 
 I love Nickel Creek, and I love Toad the Wet Sprocket. So I am still a bit surprised that I don't love this cd more. It truly seemed like an interesting combination, but somehow the Mutual Admiration Society concept mysteriously falls flat. For me, the chief sadness in this cd is that Nickel Creek with all their incredible talent morphed into a background house band. One hears them playing along hoping (against all hopes) that they'll really get going or that Sara will sing or Chris will jump in with an incredible mandolin solo or something but this never happens. Glen Phillips does all the vocals and faintly behind him Nickel Creek plays as if they don't want to upstage him. Especially disappointing is they have brilliantly performed several of these songs before in concert (namely, "Trouble"). If you are a bonafide I-Will-Buy-Everything-Nickel-Creek-Records fan, then go ahead and buy this cd; otherwise, wait until their next release comes out.  
 A ferocious beast that loves Mickey Mouse?  Capable of ripping two armed policemen to shreds?  Capable of eluding the Marines in the wilderness?  All these talents and the final encounter with this terrible monster is so anticlimatic it made me resent having wasted my time with the novel.  And the ending . . . . horrible.  It was as if Koontz thought the audience of this novel would be teenagers looking for something like R.L. Stine would write.  I'd give it a half a star if I could 
 I realy wanted to like this book. I picked it up looking for a new author. As others have noted, racism plays a big role in this book. It's not done well. The author manages to pound the issue into nearly every page regadless of wether it would fit the plot.  Those that noted that the aliens seem to share human motivations and actions are in my opinion, correct.    I had to give up on this book after about 50 pages. Like others who have reviewed it,  I love sci-fi, I thought I was getting a good action packed aliens-vs-human thriller.  What I got was a heavy handed morality play that could have been better by a third grader.  When I found out from reviews that author actually decided to write this as a first in a "series" I gave up. I rarley put down a book unfinshed. It bothers me to do so and I probably would have finished this mindnumming tale if it had been a stand alone novel.  I cannot recommend anyone read this. 
 This movie is so bad, it barely deserves mention. However, I am a big DL fan, and I am writing this in the hope that Dolph will not abandon his fans---he may be making movies like this just for the $$, but, I believe, he is also doing irreparable damage to his career 
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
  Buffy didn't move to Sunnydale until half way through the school year.   Therefore, she was still living in Los Angeles at the time this book supposedly took place.  Glaring continuity problems seem to plague all the Buffy books.  The fact that the authors aren't given permission to advance the storyline of the show in any meaningful way make the books the equivalent of really boring filler episodes of the show.  Only the books aren't as well-written and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't around to salvage the tripe.  Reading the authors attempts at dialogue is funny (laughing at them funny) at first, but then it just gets painful.  The book reads like overly earnest fan fiction and all the characters become insufferable because of their sappiness and led balloon one-liners.   I don't know Nancy Holder and Christopher Golden personally, but reading this filled me with a strong dislike and sense of pity for both of them.    
 First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon 
 I came to this book wanting to believe, and leaning towards belief, but with plenty of skepticism. This book reinforced my skepticism. It is not intended as a defense of the visions, per se, but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies, and report of Marian messages to the Parish at Medjugorge, and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events. The interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying. The questions were leading and shallow, nothing like the kind of questions I wish I could ask. Even worse, the answers were stereotyped, vague, and even evasive. Was this a language barrier problem? An artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited? An effort to avoid arguments? Perhaps. But I kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with Jesus. Jesus, despite all language barriers and editing, was always very direct, clear, and substantive, and never shied away from stirring up controversy. Jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come. I remain on guard 
 Didn't really learn anything from this or any of the other 50 diet books that I have bought over the years. 
 Luckily this book is only 160 pages, so I didn't waste too much time. It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward. Very few examples of why and how this happened.  I thought it was going to be a history of Islam, but it's more a history of Islamic nations. It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.   It'll say things like, "Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries." Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.  I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one 
 I agree with much that has been said about PJ's pathetic attempt at explaining economics. PJ is a humorist and should stick with that. In fact, if PJ were true to Smith's idea of specialization in capitalism, he would stay clear away from a subject with which he has NO expertise. Case in point, PJ seems to believe that a trade deficit with China does not truly exist(?). PJ might be a keen observer of human behavior, but that may be all that he is. 
 In all fairness I was looking for a different book -- when I got this in the mail it wasn't what I expected.  Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement.  I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks.  Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points.  Zero.  I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.  Given HoJo's has burned a place in local memory and was an important early player in the motel business,  no evidence exists of it today.  So bad road trip book.  Mildly interesting history book 
 Once upon a time I was given a vanity-published book to review. It was an illogical mess, full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. While reading "Iron John," I couldn't help thinking of it. The vanity book, however, was at least entertaining.  John Eldredge refers to "Iron John" liberally in his book "Wild at Heart," and because I considered that a ringing endorsement, I purchased a copy. I can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. The hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times.  It's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. That people can slog through it and call it "profound" and "important" is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book "spoke" to them. I think it's a case of "I'd better say I understand it, or people will think I'm not erudite." Well, let me be erudite about it: "Iron John" is a big, steaming pile of New Age crapola. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 These were horrible.  I thought I'd try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
 This woman hasn't got the simplest idea of what marriage is supposed to be. Yes, marriage is supposed to be happy, and you are supposed to enjoy your life, marriage and sex with your partner, but what Mama Gena tends to forget is that marriage is not supposed to be constant bliss. Sure it's wonderful if it is..but if it's not, she makes it out to be the end of the world. Marriage is a commitment of love, that needs work. It is because of people like mama gena that there are so many divorces in this world. She spends the entire book teaching people that happiness is the most important thing, and if you aren't happy, then your marriage sucks, and that is simply not true. All marriages suffer at times, for various reasons. It is the ability of that couple to work through those problems and overcome them that makes a marriage a good marriage, not constant happiness. Furthermore, SHe spends the rest of the book placing complete emphasis on the fact that a woman should give up the idea of being a good wife and simply fullfil her own needs and desires, and basically not give a crap about what her husband feels or thinks about it, just makes herself happy. in her diluded world, she thinks this will make your husband happy as well. Right, like your husband is going to be thrilled that you do whatever you want without caring whetehr it hurts his feelings or makes him angry, as long as you are happy, right? WRONG! Marriage is aboiut compromise. I am not in anyway saying that women should totally submit to their husbands every wish and demand. A woman has a say too, but not if it is going to hurt his feelings or go against his wishes completely. The point of marriage is grow as a couple, not bring the otehr person down just so you feel good. This woman is very selfish, and it's no wonder she is getting a divorce if this is how she acts in her marriage.   Husband and wife should work together to give each other the space they need and also the love they need. Wife and husband should not hog all the glory, or back into a corner, but compromise and support each other. This woman also obviously has no faith in God, and hasn't go tthe slightest clue as to what God's plan for marriage is.  I think she needs to stop writing this trash and keep her open, self-absorbed marriage dreams to herself. This is not the kind of example womne should be looking to for marriage advice. If i didn't know better, I'd think this was Paris Hilton's writing 
 I started ordering Glamour 2 months ago, and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me. There are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable. Ladies, my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..I dont recommend Glamour at all. 
 Is it just me or is American Pie becoming another National Lampoon type thing where they just create a bunch of weak, strait to DVD movies that are trying to sale based on the American Pie franchize name? About as lame as the Dukes of Hazzard sequal, Dumb & Dumberer, and the numerous Disney movies comin' out with strait to DVD release sequals to movies made like 50 years ago 
 We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate.  I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them.  
 I agree with many reviewers here that the book is great, but poorly organized and put too much on statistical methods. I have read through it from cover to cover for my exams.  Nevertheless, the first part discussion is very good, but you need to read other books before reading Rothman's book. Acutally, I really hate Greenland's writing, it is too obscure. I would not recommend this book to students 
 I intend to burn this book once the semester is over; it is utterly worthless.  My professor was coerced to use the book and assigns homework from the book, but the exams look nothing at all like the homework or material from the book.  My complaints: Insuffucient examples to teach a concept.  There is an inextricably, monotonous presence of teaching.  The examples are nowhere near adequate to be able to do the problems in the back of the chapter.  Superficially, the content looks great, but when you try to learn it from the book, the frustration builds until you cry.  The wording of chapter exercises and end of chapter problems is vague and problemmatic.  It is difficult to understand what is being taught, if anything is being taught at all.  I would like to use this as a reference when I graduate, but realistically, if it's as useful as cow dung now, then why would I keep it?  So, get it all over with now, the crying, the late nights pulling hair out, seeking antidepressants for the incessant crying and depression due to frustration.  Be realistic in the beginning.  Unless you have an excellent professor, you will probably not make a good grade based on homework and/or exams from this book.  Better yet, don't buy the book - you might get a better grade on the exams if you are exposed to the unnecessary stress.  [This is just an opinion - don't sue me.  If, by some strange reason, you're a math major, then you might have a partial background to cope with the book's inadequacies and take a different view. 
 A friend loaned me this book, and I found the premise intriguing and the promise of an escape-read appealing. Maybe you do have to be Southern to "get it," as another reviewer claims.   Though I enjoyed the setting (which was well-described and interesting), a few of the characters (especially the preacher/candidate who gives it all up to God with something bordering right on lunacy), and the consistent battles with hot flashes (a subject I'm learning more about every day), I was brought up short by the offhand racism in both the attitude and characterization of this book. The main character, Lin, considers herself enlightened because she wants to bring water service to the poor black part of her small town, but she makes these kinds of observations: "An Oriental couple--Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese? I could never tell--hovered close to the register...A young black couple with a runny-nosed baby argued in some kind of an indecipherable rap jargon..."  Trust me, there's plenty of this to go around, including a loudly dressed hippy lesbian whose art is all concerned with the organs of reproduction, who (of course) makes Lin very, very nervous.   Yes, maybe you do have to be Southern to find this amusing. I kept trying to like the book, and failing. I guess since I'm divorced, I am also supposed to be amused by Lin's hatred of men. No men are good, no woman has a happy marriage, any woman who is married is just putting a good face on the fact that her husband is messing around. Love does not exist outside the Breedlove family, apparently, and is only seen in self-sacrificing old white women who show Lin the meaning of real love (it involves forgiving a man everything and changing his Depends). Who does this character think she is, I wanted to ask? She hides a bunch of nice furniture paid for by her husband so the IRS won't get it, shoves it into a garage apartment, and thinks it's a triumph?   Add in the mawkish conversations between Lin and her in-recovery brother where they sit on the porch and she says how badly she misjudged him and he tears up and says, "That means a lot coming from you, Lin," (this happens over and over and over again, or at least it feels as if it does) and the talky-talky-talky descriptions of corrupt city politics, and I really had to wonder how on earth I was going to finish it.   Perhaps the most offensive part of the book it is the aborted romp between Grant and Lin. She knows exactly who he is and what he wants, and he goes to a great deal of trouble to treat her with gallantry, even though he is not offering her love. When they FINALLY get to bed, after too many descriptions of his legs and chest and spicy man-tang scent, she keeps laughing at him. When he becomes frustrated and lashes out, she erupts in hatred at the man. "Oh how dare he desire me and not love me! He should be thrashed, the scoundrel! Thank goodness I ate five brownies, got drunk and called a girlfriend rather than have some sex! I am a true Southern lady!" It's baffling, insulting, and representative of the huge ax-to-grind, chip-on-shoulder attitude of this main character.   I finally had to admit that I found her loathsome and the book tedious, and skimmed about a hundred pages, just to say I finished it. No one else needs to bother.   
 I was in a hurry when I chose this book, now I wish I'd spent a little more time flipping through it. Each section begins with dialogue between Matty and the people/dogs he is working with. That part is completely pointless, and not even entertaining to me. Finally I realized I could skip half of each chapter to get to the meat. Still though, there is pointless ad-libbing through the actually instructions! By skipping, it only took me 45 minutes to get through this book. If you can manage that, there is some usefull advice. However, for such a thick book, I was very surprised that it only covered basic commands. I am still a little confused about how to train my dog! Definately not worthy of "The Ultimate Guide.." title 
 I purchased this after browsing a book with the same title in a coffee shop -- but this is clearly not the same book. It's heavily padded with oversized illustrations that don't tell you much (old woodcuts, or 'artists conceptions') and sticks mainly to popular paranormal stuff (ghosts, UFOs and such) instead of more obscure, interesting, and weird topics. I'm going to keep looking for the book I really wanted, and I'll donate this one to my dentist's office where it'll fit right in among People magazine and Sports Illustrated 
 "Mao had done 2 things that mattered, he said. He had battled Chiang Kaishek for years and finally chased him off to that little island of Taiwan. And in the long war of resistance he had asked the Japanese to return to their ancestral home and had fought his way into the Forbidden City." Mao also (once he had the influence to do so) helped old acquaintances get local party jobs and was a writer of sorts, as well as an avid reader (of what God only knows as he obviously didn't seem to learn much from all the supposedly scholarly books he is said to have consumed). Mao's writings, however, left much to be desired, even in Mao's own opinion. When Stalin asked him in 1950 which of Mao's writings ought be published in Russia Mao demurred, responding that his works published by local publishing houses in China contained "a mass of errors and misrepresentations" & needed further review first. Stalin was no great theorist either, of course, but it seems that the author of this book has swallowed a helping of Stalin's own progranda regarding such issues. Hence Stalin not only gets most of the credit for supporting Chinese Communists (through the Soviet controlled Communist International), but is further credited with being a "founding father of the Soviet Revolution" (notwithstanding this to be a gross exaggeration on 2 fronts: 1---that he wasn't that involved & 2---that it was no revolution even, but a coup d'etat actually). And while Stalin's early collectivization drive did cause "widespread suffering" in the author's characterization he seems to think that the reason for this was that "many officials moved to fast." Interestingly, this is the only (albeit indirect) mention by the author of Stalin's self-inflicted famine while the author pointedly relates how Mao's version (particularly between 1960-61) cost at least 20 million lives. And last, but not least, the author informs us that Stalin was "the guide and inspiration to his people in the terrible years of the German invasion." You get the point now? On other "fronts:" The Korean War was induced by Stalin & wound up because of his death so that this subject is all but ignored in this book is not so surprising either. Likewise, Khrushchev & Mao's sparring contest leading to the Sino-Soviet rift, and armed clashes between their countries in 1969 is also ignored. Also ignored in this admittedly slim book is how Mao went from being a nobody to leading the Chinese Communist Party. Apparently such issues as these are too pregnant with inconvenient history or are not particularly interesting to Mr. Spence; who instead dispenses with heck of a lot of ink regaling us with details of Mao's family life---4 marriages resulting in 10 births. So we learn such important stuff as which child studied where or who of the 10 survived into adulthood. We are also treated to a litany of people that Mao could have gotten more accurate information from, but didn't, as he became more and more "divorced from reality"; as if Mao & his entourage had little clue what was really going on in the country. Yeah, that's what happened. Sometimes it's worth reading such a slim volume as this one; for instance, to get an idea of the story before moving on to more substancial works, but regarding this book I suggest you attempt a more coherent work instead and ignore Mr. Spence's "Mao." (Aside: I read and reviewed this book while in China myself.) Cheers!  
 Thank God I DID NOT BUY this book. I took 30 minutes to read this book at a bookstore and if you are interested in learning how to hack, then this book is not for you. This book DOES NOT SHOW YOU HOW TO HACK, it's just  another ordinary book which shows you how to PREVENT a hacker from attacking your computer/network. Very disappointing. Even the information in this book that shows you how to prevent a hacker attack can be found online easily. This book is definatly not worth it 
 people who listen to this stuff and call it music are deaf and dumb! 
 This movie I think was just plain depressing! Just when you think something good and happy will happen, someone dies, people seperate, bones are broken, so on and so forth. This movie got alot of great reviews, and it was a fun movie, but for people who like complete happy endings, this film is not for you. 
 This book is what you get when a guide decides to fulfil its minimum responsibilities of being an official guide. Walkthrough? Checked. Characters profile? Checked. Bestiary list? Checked. Maps? Checked.  So, what's not good about it? Well, there's plenty.   Let's first talk about the walkthrough. Is it really that difficult for strategy guides to provide a decent walkthrough these days? On first looks, this guide follows a sequence of explanation that I prefer. That is, to label important points on the various location maps, and then explain what events to look out for at these points in words. Unfortunately, the explanation is usually too brief, and doesn't provide much details. You can do yourself a favor and go find a better walkthrough on GameFAQs.com, for example.  Next, the characters and enemies profile. The characters profile is ok, and has the initiative to list down the various skills and possible commands for each character. That's good. But the bestiary list is really a big mess. Why, I mean, why, did Nintendo Power chose to present the list in alphabetical order? Imagine yourself in a player's shoes. You find yourself completing the game, only to miss, say, ten enemies undefeated. You decide buy a guide to help you find the remaining enemies, and then find that the list is so jumbled up, it takes you five minutes to find just one of them. You see, in the game, each enemy is numbered, and they're usually numbered in accordance to when they appear. So, an enemy with a name beginning with the letter "A" may be Enemy# 250 in the game, for instance, and yet, will appear first on this book's bestiary list. I think you can imagine how difficult it's going to be if you're missing Enemy# 51, and have no idea what his or her name is.  The only things that are remotely good about this book are the maps. I appreciate that there's a triple-folded attachment that has an Overworld, Underworld and Lunar map on it. But even so, the usefulness of the maps is somewhat limited, because instead of typing the names of the respective locations on the map, they somehow decided to use labels to mark them. You're then required to refer to a legend to find out what these labels are. Perhaps it's just to show uniformity, but while the label method works for a walkthrough, it certainly doesn't work for a map. I mean, we're talking about over 20 locations on the Overworld map itself. If I've to urgently look for a location, I'd have no idea what the labels are when I look at the map. I'd then have to actually look at the legend to find the place I want, and then go back to the map to find where it's located. It's a little silly - the maps are definitely large enough for words to fit in, so it baffles me as to why labels are used.  Last but not least, where's the walkthrough for Lunar Ruins? Ok, granted that this additional dungeon has randomized levels. But surely, a description of each of the character's trials in it, which are fixed, won't take more than a few pages? Instead, only one miserable page was dedicated to "briefly explain" this unlockable dungeon. Hey, I've already bought a guide. I'm prepared to be spoiled. There's no need to avoid spoilers.  So, where do these leave this book? A faraway distance from a good guide, that's where. I collect strategy guides, especially for games that I enjoy playing. I access its helpfulness after I beat the game - I'm already at Level 94 when I bought this, and have completed all trials in Lunar Ruins, by the way - and I found this book not helpful in many areas. If this is what they think an official guide is all about, then they should really think again 
 if amazon allowed zero stars, this would get it. absolutely awful. 
 First of all I too have followed Myss for years but she is so self-righteous and condescending that it makes it VERY difficult to listen to her. One more CD of her ranting and rageing at her audience. She always sounds so angry and sarcastic.  I find it very sad that Myss who has an incredible understanding and depth and is amazing when it comes to teaching the Truths of the Universe feels she has to abuse people verbally in order to teach. I must say she lost me on this one as I was so distracted with her continuous yelling  that I coundn't hear what she was teaching.   I have given this alot of thought and have come to the conclusion that she is actually yelling at herself in hopes SHE will GET what she is teaching under the guise of teaching others. I hope she gets it soon so she can eventually put out an audio that is respectful of her audience and stop projecting her anger and rage onto them.   Some people say she is taking off the gloves, and refer to her rousing ways... I say "the emperor has no clothes on." They can call it whatever they want but verbal abuse is verbal abuse.   I have found that I do much better with reading her books. I have friends who refuse to listen to her tapes or read her books anymore. This audio almost put me in their camp but I have decided to stay with her books however, after hearing so many of her audios I can sometimes still hear her condescention, shaming and sarcasm but not to the same degree.   I believe in Truth wherever I find it and so I brace myself whenever I listen to a Myss tape and try albeit not easy to ignore her persona and be open to the Truth that comes through her.  I must admit it was more difficult this time then usual. This is one CD set I could have lived without and one other thing, in addition to the verbal abuse most of what she talked about is on many of her other audios.  So for you Myss supporters and those of you who just discovered her ... know that if you can get past her sarcastic and condescending delivery she teaches great truths, and shares her understandings and excellent insights 
 TOTAL waste of time. I got this as a gift and didn't have to waste my own money on it, but only an extraordinarily clueless woman who has never watched television or read a magazine in her life would benefit. The suggestions are ridiculous (seriously, wear a tiara, call your girlfriends, fingerpaint with your feet) and some even borderline offensive. There's a section about being "cosmopolitan" that suggests things you can do to be French, Italian, etc. On the French page, one of the suggestions is to "skip the shower." On the Spanish one, it is "skip the underwear." These women have got to be NUTS.  If anyone ever calls me a diva again, so help me.. 
 I did'nt understand this book and I could'nt even get through the 1st chapter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 The book reads well, except for a few editing errors, as I understand such things. It set up a "promise" to the readers. It followed through on that promise. While there could have been some better editing, the book reads well.    I also liked seeing Loviatans, a "evil" group, used in a non evil light. It was a great way to bring some shades of grey to the black and white that is DND.  There were some very good ideas that I thought were handled well within the scope of the book.    However  I didn't think the characters acted anywhere near as smart as they should have been.  At one point, a character uses a spell, which is against the law, knowing that the people around can't tell it isn't arcane and so gets in trouble.  It didn't seem to mesh with my idea of the character, because besides not being smart, it was against common sense as well.  I found it laughable when, in DND game terms, a second level spell (out of nine levels) is called "powerful".  I think the author should have re-worked it to make it more personal to that character and why it was powerful to them.  In such a context, it would have made sense.  As it was written, it didn't make sense that it was called powerful.  In general, there is not a lot of focus on the characters but instead the action that is propelling the characters forward.  That's okay in movies, which are more propelled by action.  For my books, though, I want to understand better the characters and what they are going through.  The priestess, on whom the book is named, is forced into situation after situation and reacts for most of the book.  When she is finally able to make a choice, instead of being a big denouement for the character, it feels trivial and assumed that she will make that decision, rather than a critical point for her.  None of the characters have a big, life altering decision to make, and I think a story should be about those big life moments.  They are all propelled along by the events around them, never seeming to ask why these things are happening.  It seems unlikely that the characters would do that, yet they do.    I guess I expect some sense of morality or lesson in my books, either for the reader or for one of the main characters. However, this book is lacking that. There is no sense of what is learned by the main characters. There is only one character that might have had a "crisis point" and was changed. However, the character wasn't emphasized nor shown how they changed and so any lesson there has been lost. The rest of the characters had some bad things happen to them but I didn't get a sense that it was "big" for any of them.   And maybe that's its problem. The book stops focusing on the characters after it introduces them and instead looks at the action, such that there is not much happening on a personal level. That's probably why I didn't care what happened to the characters.  I also don't think it worked.  I think focusing on the action is what created the lack of interest in the characters as well as the stereotypes and it didn't work for me.    I thought that the ending left too much unanswered with the characters.  I suppose it wasn't relevant to the "promise" but it would have been nice to get a much better sense of what the main characters were going to do after these events. It would have been nice to get a better sense of how these fit in with the back story and how well it worked for that character as well.   Overall, I had a bad taste in my mouth after reading it almost to the point of deciding to avoid the author until I see a good review of him.  I would give it a D+.   jd 
 I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift 
 Ok I have to tell you, about a year ago I was looking forward to playing a show with this supposedly garage rock group from Denmark, who had been hyped continually.  The album may be good, don't know as I haven't heard it, but they put on one of the most boring live shows I've ever seen, the only standout being a cover song.   Big let down and basically a hipster joke, best part was watching four guys in beatle boots trying to carry a 3oo pound hammond down a set of stairs into the room where the club held their shows.  Honestly I wasn't impressed at all....  
 I listened to this book on tape and although I enjoyed the beginning and was looking forward to a good story I found myself dissappointed and a bit disinterested by the end.  There is no question that Lyden lived overcame a traumatic childhood and it is interesting to read about it.  But her conclusions seemed, well, inconclusive.  In the end she waxes poetic but doesn't really make any clear point.  She accepts her mother and misses her mothers manias and she repeats how content she is with her own life.  It seemed more like she really didn't know how to synthesize her story and that she was trying to convince herself and the readers that she was "at peace" then it actually seemed true.  At the end of the book Lyden still didn't seem to have the solid foundation which, sadly, her childhood failed to provide 
 It was filmed before a live audience .When some of the "witnesses", didn't respond to the gunshots and the aftermath,it just adds credence to a vast conspiracy theory.Zapruder handed over the film.And had to legally fight to get it back.The filmed shooting clearly shows the upper-right side of JFK's head ,being removed.So,why were the released autopsy photos,showing an exit wound having grazed the very top right-side of JFK's head? Two top autopsy doctors reported that JFK's top right-side and brain were imploded and expeled onto the limo's trunk.Later,their stories were recanted and rectified to stating that Kennedy's brain was removed and stored for further examination.When RFK found out about this,he ordered it returned.Yet,the doctors then stated the JFK brain was now "lost and misplaced" . It appears that the CIA monkeyed with the Zapruder film, by removing some frames.The film clearly shows JFK being hit ,from the back ,reaching for his throat, bullit possibly going forward to hit Connelly's back scapula and raising wrist.All body-hits in a split second ,at close-range and at street level.The close-range shot did not impede the bullit's progress.This adds support to a police-escourt shooter ,being involved. Zapruder seemed shakened by the whole experience.I think some of audience,at the Ford's Theatre 1865,also knew the evening's comedy would unfold into live tragedy,before their very eyes 
 As a gay man, I could not possibly come to Terry Eagleton for help or advice. He is like the university professor who throws his hands up in the air and says: "I can't help you gay people become great critics and theorists; go see Judith Butler or Eve Sedgwick!" Eagleton is a white heterosexual male who has ONLY one thing going from him: class analysis. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have anything. In fact, all he can talk about is class. Look very carefully in Eagleton's texts: gays, women, and minorities do not hold a very high place . . . if they are ever even mentioned at all. I suppose Eagleton would prefer they simply weren't there, clouding up reality. Eagleton must be a very troubled man: not only is he himself a bourgeois academic, Fredric Jameson is superior to him in every way and has said it all (in terms of Marxism), leaving Eagleton with only re-chewed polemics. 
 I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go 
 I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire.  Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.  The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths.  Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality.  This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.    Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel.  Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about.  The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting.  Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before.  It's a truly frustrating experience 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.   I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 Director:  Gary Fleder Cast:  Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, Brittany Murphy, Skye McCole Bartusiask, Guy Torry, Jennifer Esposito, Shawn Doyle, Victor Argo, Conrad Goode, Paul Schulze, Lance Reddick, Famke Janssen. Running Time:  113 minutes Rated R for violence, including some gruesome images, and language.  Every fall, Hollywood trots out their latest thrillers, attempting to cash in on the college crowd who wants to bring their dates to a dark theater and take advantage of the squeamishness of the content on the screen; there is a hidden connection in the biting of nails and the changing of the leaves, yet without fail every year there are enough thrillers to keep manicurists in business. Nothing sums up the quintessential fall thriller quite like "Don't Say A Word", a suspense romp as routine as they come.  Diverting enough to fool you into a good time, "Don't Say A Word" makes one wish for a leap in time to the holiday Oscar contenders already.  Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) is a successful psychiatrist with a beautiful wife (Famke Janssen) and a cherubic daughter. On Thanksgiving morning, a group of bad guys, lead by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), break into Nathan's apartment and kidnap his daughter. What the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital. Since Nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts, Patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel. Nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers, but as he gets deeper into Elisabeth's mind, he realizes the young girl could be helped after all.  It's perfect casting to place Michael Douglas in the lead role, as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can. Douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in "Fatal Attraction" and "A Perfect Murder; Douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film, as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot, rich stud who gets in over his head. The film does contain many moments of pure distressed Douglas (his forte), with his hair glistening, teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room, etc. Douglas, at least in the first act of the film, makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks. Soon enough, director Gary Fleder places too much narrative nonsense on Douglas's shoulders, and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre's conventions take him to the safety of the end credits.  Director Gary Fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game, having directed both "Kiss The Girls" and the rollicking "Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead." Not really an imaginative director, Fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done. With "Don't Say A Word," Fleder isn't working with a particularly good script, so he falls back on what has worked for him before. This plan of attack from Fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar. The film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh. The end result making "Don't Say A Word" more boring than exciting.  The thriller, which is set in New York City, uses the city and apartment locations well, creating a nice sense of claustrophobia. It is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest. Moving to an obviously-a-soundstage cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces. The film must end with a clichd showdown, which is the reason for the move to a different location, but Fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city.  The one element that Fleder does get right is the casting of actress Brittany Murphy. A powderkeg of emotions, Murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged Elisabeth. Murphy is a grand talent (where is her Emmy for her voice work as Luanne Platter on "King Of The Hill"?), and the only actress in Hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute, little princess ("Just Married", "Uptown Girls"). Unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions, Murphy makes a vivid impression in "Don't Say A Word."  You've seen this type of film before, and just because it's the time of year when apples taste the best doesn't make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable. For fans of the genre, "Don't Say A Word" is another solid installment in the Michael Douglas versus New York crime saga. Just don't expect any surprises 
 J.D. Salinger's last published work is more than 43 years old now, and still stirs many in the same absent way Seymour Glass animates his brother Buddy in this pair of stories first published in 1963. Are both cases of delusional devotion?  In the first story, "Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters," originally published in The New Yorker in 1955, we get what amounts to Salinger's first deep-dish treatment of the Glass family saga ("Zooey" saw print later, and previous stories featuring the Glasses were far less insular) as Buddy shows up for Seymour's wedding, only to find Seymour stood up his bride. In the second piece, 1959's "Seymour: An Introduction," Buddy foregoes any semblance of plot to explain who Seymour was.  Like a lot of other people, I am put off by the convoluted nature of "Seymour," as well as the explanations of those who defend it. Actually, there could be something to the idea of writing a plotless story, using characters like the Glasses people know from other works, but this is assuredly not it. Salinger too obviously indulges himself, spouting contempt at his generation and his critics, throwing up lame jokes and referencing obscure Japanese poets as a smokescreen to conceal his literary, intellectual, and metaphysical nakedness.  "What a marvelous convenience it would be if writers could let themselves describe their characters' clothes, article by article, crease by crease," Salinger writes in the role of Buddy, pretty much summing up the approach of "Seymour" as well as its underlying failure. His interest in his subject is not only all-consuming, it is not all that deep.  "Raise High" is a better story, though that's not saying much. "Franny And Zooey," the previously published Salinger book, also combined a better story with a weaker one, but there at least you got one terrific story in "Franny," a bold, empathetic tale of power and focus. "Raise High" doesn't know where it's going, and is in no hurry to get there. You get nice asides, like when Buddy sees an old chair and remembers a beloved bulldog, long dead, who slept there and left his chewmarks. There's also some arresting ambiguity, as when Buddy reads Seymour's journal and we get maybe a suggestion of unease at some apparent insanity.  But "Roof Beam" doesn't end so much as fizzle away, with Buddy snoozing in an empty apartment after the mystery of Seymour's absence has been resolved via an unseen phone call. Emptyness is a recurrent theme in Salinger's Glass writings, here as in "Franny & Zooey," where various Glasses are often seen in isolation thinking or writing about absent kin. For such a happy family, there's an overwhelming sadness about the Glasses that suggests Salinger found himself in a bit of a dead end with them, one from which he never emerged. Further evidence of this can be found in the web-available "Hapsworth 16, 1924," Salinger's last public blast, published in The New Yorker in 1965.  Salinger was one of the most important American writers of our lifetime, not to mention a seminal figure of our culture, but his greatness lies elsewhere, not here. Read this only if you are a Salinger completist, or else interested in the price genius can extract from its recipients 
 Maybe not a bad source for an exepienced SQL programmer, but very frustrating for a beginner. There's no such thing as "generic SQL"; regretfully, it's vendor-specific and doesn't really comply ANSI stndards.. 
 Good ideas and insights bogged down by cumbersome writing.   I found myself repeatedly flipping around to decipher the alphabet soup of acronyms.  If you are serious about the subject of peacekeeping, this book is a useful reference, but otherwise you should pass on it 
 101 Bulletin Board Ideas is the only item I have bought from Amazon that displeased me. It is religious in nature, yet there was no mention of that fact when I bought it. Ms. Lee's cutesy ideas are not academic in nature - there is absolutely not one academically based idea in the book - and I was not even able to give the book away, despite knowing a couple of Catholic school teachers. The book would only be helpful to those who teach pre kindergarten in a Christians only school. 1 star for the rating is still one too many 
 I wrote you that this DVD did not work, it was would not play. I have no other problems with any other DVDs. You did not respond!!!!!!!!!!!11 You took my money and gave me something worthless!!!!!!!!!!1 
 The real title should be "Computational Conformal Mapping in 1975." It's far from the state of the art, leaves out major topics and contributions, and has barely any reproducible computation in it. At best an introduction to classical, little-used methods 
 This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story.  There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell:  First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring 
 The information that is in this book is good but it is way overpriced.  I could get the same amount of information in anthor book for 30 dollars cheaper 
 I wish I could have read the reviews here before buying this book. I bought it while at the airport because the description on the back sounded interesting. It isn't the page turner that it could have been.   The beginning is great and the gets you hooked, but it's pretty much what's on the back cover that got you to buy the book. Even from the beginning, Edward's prose is annoying, she describes things for no reason and it feels like she's wasting our time, trying to draw out the storyline.   Once the main event is over, the plot goes nowhere and it's incredibly boring. I started flipping past paragraphs of irrelevant descriptions.   I didn't think the ending was surprising at all. You know it's going to happen, you're wondering why Edwards takes so long to get to it. I did think it was touching and, fine, I admit it, it made me cry... but in my defense, I cry at everything (even that depression commercial chokes me up - Where does depression hurt? Everywhere. Who does depression hurt? Everyone.)    All in all, this book seemed interesting, but I wish I had chosen another (better written) book to read. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 As a Jew and a vegetarian, I find it completely unconscionable that Emeril would use his fame to profit from a book that pushes the virtues of pork fat.  Doesn't he realize that there is a small minority of us out there that doesn't subscribe to his over-the-top method of cooking everything with pork fat, as well as other animal by-products?  I've watched his show a few times, and got this book from a friend a few months ago.  While the man has some talent, I find it really distasteful that he profits from his fame and over-hyped ego.  I looked in vain throughout the book for a recipe that would be culturally and morally sensitive, but came up empty handed.  This book is a prime example of the excesses of the capitalist system gone awry 
 I have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased.  I would avoid this brand.  [... 
 I just have a correction for the user that made a complete list of all the songs in the movie. I think the name was "A Music Fan" but I'm not sure.  "Walkin' On Sunshine" was sung by Katrina and the Waves, not K.C. and the Sunshine Band.  For those of you not sure, that is the first song on Jack Black's character's monday morning tape.  Plus, I just want to say that Bonet's pathetic singing making it on the record and not Katrina and the Waves is just sad 
 I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the "quality of the item wasn't good." What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website. 
 This was the first book I saw in the store in my search for a good summer read.  The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book?  Did they even read it?  It's not what this book is about at all.    This book is interesting at first.  As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going.  This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.  About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot.  No luck. I gave up on this book- it's just too much work.     
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened.  I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff 
 I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably 
 I have been buying this book since its very first edition. Although  the ilife suite has added significant new features in version's 5 and 6, they are berely covered here. For example, iMovie's addition of styles, a major new development is covered in just 2 pages - a third of which is text explaining the feature! Also, this book is priced as if it had a DVD (it is the same price as the other editions with the DVD), even though the DVD is missing in action. The author's own 5 star rating is especially pathetic. Even worse, Heid promised "new" sections to the companion web site a year ago for Garageband [hello, Garageband has been part of ilife for OVER 2 YEARS !!!] and iWeb, and the pages still say "coming soon!".  This book needs a major overhaul to continue to be effective 
 It is a neat looking puzzle but when my son opened it on Christmas the sound wouldn't work. We tried different batteries but still no sound. He does like the puzzle but the main reason I bought it was b/c it was supposed to make neat sounds. Maybe it was just one time luck that it didn't work 
 This is actually an excellent introduction to short term trading. Everything is well explained and pleasantly written. Day Trading 101. However, it's not really marketed as that, so it gets 2 stars.  If you read this book and much of it is a revelation, you need to spend the next 4-6 months doing research, reading, and paper trading. If you were to start trading based on what's in this book you would lose your shirt.  It's akin to a book on football that explaines the field, how far apart the lines are, where the end zone is, who the players are, what the positions do, what a pass is, the three things that can happen when you pass, etc. It would even have a few basic plays, the "long pass", "student body right", etc. Everything you need to know about football, except how to actually play and win.  Basic, well explained information is what this book has. And if you're just getting into trading it's a worthwhile read. It'll give you a foundation that will help you understand more advanced books like Secrets Of An Underground Trader or Technical Analysis of the Financial Market (Murphy).  But even the lack of advanced technical stuff is not really a strike against Toni's book. The technical books really are just research books for helping you design your own system. They are practically outdated as soon as they come out and even if they're not, it's a dangerous thing to rely on someone else's system. You need to design a system that you can trade and you're comfortable trading. If you can't do this, NO book can help you.  Which leads to the main reason I gave the book 2 stars. Lack of any real discussion of trading psychology. The book you NEED to buy if you're going to trade is Reminiscences Of A Stock Operator. It's 80 years old and explains the mentality of trading as well as any book out there. The Psychology of Risk is another good book. Understanding what it takes to trade and determining if you have that is critical. As is understanding if you can make split second decisions when it's $40K of your own money on the line.  Toni devotes a few pages to it, including a silly 'Psychology quiz' which is probably the same quiz they use in the back of Cosmo to determine whether you're an agressive lover or a passive one.  She also devotes a page at the end of each chapter to 'self-help' tips. It's true that you can't design a system for yourself if you don't know yourself, so these are helpful. At the end of the day tho, they won't explain what it takes mentally to be a trader. Personally, I find Yoga to be a good way to clear my head in the morning and get focused. But it's a means to end. Not the end itself. Such are the self-help tips in the book. If you don't know what you're trying to achieve, they are only so useful.  So if you've read several books on trading you can skip this. There are much more advanced books out there.  If you're new to trading and are looking for a well written book explaining the basics and a bit more, this is worth the money. But it's not a classic or something you'll find yourself referring to as the years go by 
 This isn't a "hands-on" projects book as the title would suggest.  Poorly written.  Useless.  I could summarize each chapter as such: "Ok, go buy a RC car, buy some components, attach the components to the car... and you're done.  You have a robot!  Isn't that cool?"  Sheesh.  What a waste of paper.  I just bought Robot Builder's Bonanza.  I've heard good things about that book - so I'll give that a try now.  It certainly can't be any worse than John Iovine's book.  Buyer beware on "Robots, Androids, and Animatrons" 
 I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get "Born in Ice.&quot 
 This is an early work by a transsexual person but I did not enjoy it. Ms. Morris of course knows how to use the English language in an elegant manner but the book still failed for me. She treats women as nothing more than a shadow of men. Her book thinks it is perfectly acceptable for women to be sexually harrassed by men. She accepts sex role stereotypes pertaining to men and women. This book would not be  helpful to modern day transgendered youth. 
 The city of Fort Myers, FL is disparraged in this book as a menagerie of NASCAR fans and strip clubs. Anyone who's spent time in Fort Myers knows that there aren't many strip clubs and the ones that are here aren't a big part of the local scene (what to do on a random Saturday night) like they are in other parts of Florida, like Tampa, Clearwater, or Miami 
 Director of two `Scooby-Doo' films makes another comedy without the eye-popping CGI of the funny talking dog, and now what you get is `Yours, Mine, and Ours,' a remake of 1968 comedy that should have been left untouched. The only good thing about the newer version is the kids (and some of them would be seen in a much better film sooner or later), so if you a fan of, say, Dean Collins, please stop reading this review here, take a look at the film and enjoy yourself.  But I'm talking about the film itself, and Dennis Quaid & Rene Russo, and what I am going to say is not very nice. To their credits, they truly look like two adults Frank and Helen, widowed Coast Guard Admiral and widowed designer, who had been romantically linked to each other when high school students. Their story is sweet, romantic and convincing. Sadly their story ends in five minutes.  The rest of the film is about the predictable culture clash comedy between two sets of values with lots of badly-constructed pratfalls. Frank is an uptight military person while Helen is a free-thinking vegetarian. Frank has 8 children while Helen 10 (including the adopted kids). Frank demands his home should be `shipshape' while Helen wants her kids always `free.' So what would happen if they live in a same place?  One of the two terrible things about `Yours, Mine, and Ours' is its awfully made slapsticks which are just embarrassing to see. If you think it funny to see someone slipping over vomit on a yacht, or Dennis Quaid soaked in green slime, this is your film. And you can also see Mr. Quaid kissing a pig. Rene Russo is not the same sexy woman you have seen in `The Thomas Crown Affair,' but her stand-in who looks very tired.  But the most annoying thing is the characters of the kids (or what they do). These spoiled children are not only allowed to eat a bucketful of sweets, but they plan to break up the relations between Frank and Helen just because they want to live as they want! Of course they relent after getting what they want, and cue to the sappy ending.  This messy and unfunny comedy comes from four big names - MGM, Paramount, Nickelodeon and Columbia. The images are crisp, and shot in widescreen. Despite its beautiful package, however, none of the cast would like to remember the film and its contents that are simply dreadful 
 Don't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have A CHORUS LINE back on Broadway.  It is also wonderful to have this new recording, which is essentially the entire score.  It be nice if "And..." could have made the cut, but the money hungry producers shouldn't be expected to include that.  (Yes, that was sarcasm).    The current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only PART of what made it so wonderful the first time around.  Michael Bennett's choreography and direction are brilliant, and they alone are worth the price of admission.  When the show fails, it fails because of the cast.  Unfortunately, most of the flaws have been captured on this recording.  Some of the orchestrations are bland and sound "canned" (just as it does in the theatre.)  The opening number plays at a DEATHLY pace.  Charlotte D'Amboise can't sing.  It just doesn't work.  Get it if you're a collector, but if you're not - save your money.  Get the Original 
 In this book a large group of Harvard economists and political scientists, and a few anthropologists, debate the radical proposition that culture makes a difference in economic development. While its nice to know the foreign policy elite are ready to think about culture as more than `western civilization,' it turns out that this allows them to blame all poverty on the malformed and defective cultures of underdeveloped countries. It's as if the `culture of poverty' debate never took place. Most anthropologists will grind away several millimeters of tooth enamel while reading this. Why do economists and political scientists feel like they don't have to read the work of people who have devoted their lives to studying cultural difference? 
 When I ordered this Barbie, the one with the navy blue dress was shown, but instead the one with the light blue dress showed up. She does not look much better than an off brand dollar store Barbie, and Mattel should be ashamed to put out such a low quality Holiday Angel Barbie. In general, their Angel Barbies are stunning but this one stop short with her thin wings (looks like cardboard on the back), her hair is a mess, and her dress is so simple. Her make-up is simple as well. Also, she seems to just stare off into space. I was very disappointed with this purchase.   Update (1/4/06) Since writing this review and playing Barbie with my daughter at least once a day, I have found myself more often than not choosing this Barbie as mine when we play. I have become fond of her face even though at first I did not like it since it was not what I was expecting. It is very nostalgic of the older style barbies, and is wider than it appears in this listing. I also love the way her arms pivot unlike some specific Barbie dolls. Her hair is still messier than normal for a Barbie, but I have grown to really like the dress although the wings are hard to stay on despite the velcro. I would recommend purchasing her simply because this is an unusual Barbie for Mattel to put out and she will add some diversity to your collection. 
 There were many times when I had to mentally and physically shake my head as Nye supports his thesis that America's dominance in this globalized system actually necessitates its interdependence with the rest of the world (read; France and Germany).     The underlying idealism of Nye points to a world where if only the United States of America would submit, just a little, to other states and respect (read; follow) their opinions then BY GOLLY our Air will be cleaner and North Korea and Iran will give up their nuke programs.  Also, Europe will magically create a more robust military transport capability and actively participate in counterterrorism and ethno-religious conflicts abroad which, will be on the decline.    My biggest gripe was Nye believing that self constraint will somehow lead to greater leadership opportunities above when these tools of self constraint are tools used by weaker countries to limit US power.  That's why, 'they' want to make US weaker.  Nye, in one sentence by my count, concedes this point but still argues that in the long term it'll be for the good.  However, Nye does not recognize the ulterior motives by countries such as Germany and a nostalgic France (Europe is given way too much credit and attention in his book as well).  Given the self interests of other states and the entrenched problems associated with failing states, failed states, and the Middle East it is a stretch to believe that countries will unite with the United States (who will still be the 100 ton gorilla in the room) and make the world a better place.    I don't buy it.  So...don't buy it.  
 David Irving, fluent in both German and Russian, was at one time the only historian who had access both to German and Soviet files of the Second World War. He was the one who, forty years ago, made the world aware of the terror-bombing and bloodbath at Dresden. Now, at age 67, he is facing three and maybe ten years in prison for "Holocaust" denial (the term, incidentally, was the invention of Elie Wiesel, who has urged perpetual hatred of all things German). Questions:   1). Since when should it be a CRIME to deny anything?    2). What happened to freedom of thought and of speech?   3). Who most resembles a National Socialist or Communist - the one who defends said freedom of thought and speech or the one who wants to see his opponents JAILED?   If you commit a "crime" like Mr. Irving's today, you are likely to wind up with your academic degrees rescinded (Staeglich), your body pummeled in the street (Faurisson) or yourself deported from our constitutional republic to a country which recognizes thought crime (Rudolf).   Let us read the books of BOTH sides and let US decide the truth!    Shame, shame, shame 
 Waste of time.  I turned it off.  The "extra features" were slightly interesting.  The actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing.  A vanity piece.  Why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating, badly-written melodrama.  Don't bother 
 I've had this griddle for maybe a year and use it 3-4 times a month.  Yesterday, I noticed a smell and then saw smoke coming from where you plug the cord into the griddle, I got to it before it started a fire.  My brother-in-law had the same problem with his a few months ago.  This griddle should be recalled, it is a saftey hazard!! 
 I have also researched one of the subjects with which A Death in Brazil deals, namely the election, government and impeachment of Fernando Collor, the former President of Brazil. From 1991 to 1997, I was managing editor at Veja, the magazine with the widest circulation in Brazil, which played an influential role in bringing about Collor's impeachment. In 1992, I received the Editor of the Year Award from the World Press Review for Veja's coverage during the period.    At the end of 1999, after almost two years of full-time writing, I finished my 720-page book on the subject, entitled Notícias do Planalto: A imprensa e Fernando Collor (News From the Planalto: The press and Fernando Collor). In writing the book I interviewed 140 people and read more than a hundred books. Notícias do Planalto was a bestseller in Brazil, selling more than 80,000 copies.    Peter Robb invited me to lunch in Rio de Janeiro at the beginning of 2001. Robb praised Notícias do Planalto and told me of his plans to write a book about Brazil, Fernando Collor and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. I recommended that he read certain books and gave him phone numbers for both Collor and Lula da Silva. I never heard from him again.    When I read A Death in Brazil I was rather shocked. There were nineteen passages in Robb's book that were startlingly similar to passages in Notícias do Planalto. What we are dealing with here is not simply use of information, as is normal in intellectual work. The fact is that entire sentences, lines of reasoning and images recur with only a few words changed. I have prepared translated transcripts of the passages in question from Notícias do Planalto and the corresponding passages from A Death in Brazil.    Robb mentions my book only once. On page 313, in the section "Sources and Readings", he says that Notícias do Planalto is a "very fluid and complete account of Fernando's fast rise and faster fall as seen by the journalists of Brazilian press and television, not least of whom [is] the author". This mention in no way justifies the use Peter Robb seems to have made of my book. One wonders if he would have used my book so freely had it been published in English.   
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 One of the labels for this Anchorman DVD labels the edition as "uncalled for", and I couldn't agree more- this movie was completely uncalled for and unnecessary.  In an edition of GameInformer magazine, Reiner and Joe recalled a conversation they had in which it took them several hours to "regain normal higher-level brain functions" after an unfortunate run-in at the movie theaters between them and Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne; I hate to say it, but I feel the same way about this movie. This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour.  The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby. Anchorman really wasn't that interesting, I laughed at maybe one joke in the movie, and overall I hated the experience.  Good thing I watched it at a friend's house and not at the theaters- otherwise, I'd have to demand my money back 
 I think of Caroline Myss' other two books as adding to my information and spiritual knowledge.  This boook however does not have the same effect.  It's main theme is to 'pay it forward'. 
 It seems every book on evolution nowdays spouts a new version of how we got here.  This book is no different.  What the authors are doing here is obvious: Because life is adaptive and evolves purposefully, these guys are trying to construct this reality onto a foundation of accidents. It's a truly laughable premise that is so funny it almost hurts.  This book is almost worthless.  If this book were a political persuasion it would vote "moderate."  And it's absolutely a joke that any book written on evolution would leave out a detailed discussion of subjects such as epigenetics, horizontal gene transfer, and environmentally-induced gene expression. The last of which touched on in this book, but only fleatingly.  This book is good for one thing: taking neo-darwinism one step closer to the trashcan where it belongs.  This is one last attempt to save a dying theory 
 Anybody who knows the ABC of Islam will clearly tell you that she does not know anything, I mean absolutely anything about Islam. She is clearly a confused women being used by Zionists and Christians fundamentalist who are trying very hard to demonize Islam. She is just a tool for them. There is no trouble with Islam. The trouble is with her brain. Do not waste your time and money.    This woman is promoted as a Muslim, by those who use her in their campaign of maligning Islam. I suggest you learn some basics of Islam, read a little bit of Quran, and a little bit of Hadith, then ask yourself this question: Is she Muslim? I am sure your answer will be an emphatic no. This woman is not Muslim but promoted as Muslim. This is just one of their malicious tactics.  Would you let a carpenter operate on your eyes instead of an eye doctor? Would you let a plumber operate on your heart instead of a cardiologist? Would you let mechanic prescribe for you medicine?  So why let somebody who has no knowledge of Islam teach you about Islam?  Think about it  It is not worth even 1 star.    
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 The photo for this item shows a white napkin with black stripes.  What gets shipped is a black napkin with white stripes.  Since the label on the napkin itself matches the description on this item, I believe it's the photo here that is wrong. Nice quality napkins, though.  Heavier than I expected.  If they had been the right color, I'd have kept them 
 I checked this book out from our library to see if it would meet my needs as an in-depth introduction and more to the neurosciences. I have a number of MIT press/Bradford books and expected quite a bit from this one. I was impressed with the breadth and range of topics and the quality of scholarship, but the incredible number of typos, particularly in the second section, left me steamed. Those poor authors who had the spelling of their names butchered in print have my sympathy. These typos include some in the diagrams, which lead to confusion. I expect a better quality of editing from a large professional university press. I bought Principles of Neuroscience (Kandel) instead. My advice would be to check out a copy of the Gazzaniga from your library and go over it to see if it is acceptable to you before you spend [...] on it 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 This was absolutely horrible. A complete sycophant like Barnes shouldn't be writing about his fearless "rebel." Perhaps someone will write a good biography about Bush, but barnes isn't the one. If you like FOX News, you'll love this book. Otherwise, avoid at all costs 
 I bought this in the hopes it would be a good reference for solving crossword puzzles. Well, I have never once found what I needed in this book. So this is a warning to others: the trivia in it is not useful for crosswords. Since the book may be good for other things, just not what I bought it for, I gave it 2 stars. To me it's worth zero 
 This book is seriously flawed.  Utterly implausible plot, unconvincing dialogue, seriously stupid characters.  The writing was so tedious I had to skip entire pages of drivel just to get through it.  The book was so badly written, I threw the book down several times from sheer frustration.  I forced myself to finish the book, but never again.  Ludlum is on my "Avoid" list 
 I've flipped through this book countless times while browsing my local library's knitting section and I'm always turned off by the boring and frequently ugly designs and color schemes. This author apparently has never met an earth tone she didn't like. How about adding a little sparkle to some of those muddier colors with some jewel tones? I can't speak for technique having never used the book. My advise is to browse through it at the library or book store before purchasing it here. Put it this way--it never inspires me enough to check it out of the library---for free! Of course, I'm not a big fan of her mother's book, Knitting Without Tears (I can imagine the gasps of outrage since she seems to be a knitting godess) and wish I'd spent my money on something less boring. I've had Knitting Without Tears for nearly four years now and have yet to use it for anything. It's just wasting space on my shelf. Since this book is a much bigger investment be wise and borrow a copy before buying 
 While the author surely knows his material, the presentation is dry, tedious and completely uninspired.  It is not a book for beginners either--readers need quite a background before even going into this book 
 Out of the box we noticed the table top was warped. When you push on one side of it the other pops up.  Definately not suitable for crafts or play.  Returned it that night 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 SO, here again!  This is just another Columbia Tristar's straght-to-video film, which, if you know what I mean, a pretty bad sign.  However, if you see such names as Gena Gershon and Dwight Yoakam, you might hope this is something better than usual trashes.  Sorry, '3 Way' is as bad as you can imagine, utterly thrill-free modern noir, which has no sense of suspence.  And Gena Gershon's role is a very small one!  The plot is based on one book of which title I forgot.  Anyway, it's about 'Lew' (Dominic Purcell), who happens to overhear the conversations about kidnap plans.  After identifying the would-be criminals, Lew thinks of intercepting all the money to himself.    Then, we are told that Lew has a girlfriend named Rita (Joy Bryant), who may or may not be a reliable partner in their own crime.  This not-so-exciting story gets more complicated by one quiet-mannered man Herbert, who thinks of different plans of getting easy money from Lew, whose unfaithful wife, I almost forgot to tell you, was supposed dead, or killed, which was shown in the pre-credit scenes.  Complicated, isn't it?  Or called it muddled if you like.  As this is a film noir, any complex plot can be excused as long as you get what you see in good noirs -- plots clever enough to be manipulating our (or the characters') minds, and convincing atomosphere.    But you get none of them.  For the film is hopelessly flat.  When the character finds out the owner of a car by stumbling upon the same bumper sticker at a shop (really), you should start to worry.  When the 'good memories about the life with my wife' are expressed with flashbacks showing a man and a woman running on the beach, both smiling and hugging each other, you better push the fast-forward button.  In addition to Purcell and Bryant, Ali Larter and Desmond Harrington appear, none of whom can save the mess.  And Ms. Gershon's role is so small that you might not notice that she is there.  And except Dwight Yoakam, who is a real professional and shows what a pro can do with cool, subdued performance, all the acting is what you can call blatantly mediocre, or simply bad.  My advice: don't watch.  Don't even think about renting either 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 If you do buy this book save the receipt so that you can send it back if you are disappointed like I was. No respectable publisher would ever publish this book 
 This is an odd little book about being gay in Los Angeles over a 24-hour period in the early Nineties, when AIDS was a overwhelming force in most gay men's lives. The novel consists of two parts: (1) rapprochement of two heart-broken, former lovers, (2) and a wild escapade they mutually take. Each is a seamless whole, so methinks this was originally two shorter stories that were later woven together. Given the very short time-frame, the plot is nominal, and has almost farcical feel to it. Necessarily, the dialogue, which carries the novel, is crisp and energetic.   If the reader likes stereotypes of gay men, this novel will probably appeal: There's plenty of rage, sex, rage, momentary suspense, rage, camp, rage, drugs, rage, music, rage, movies, and even Derrida -- and did I mention rage? These are some mighty angry dudes. And apparently the only men these angry men find attractive are "blonds with honey hair." They are almost as ubiquitous as the rage and the word "kitsch." There's plenty of that too. The ending, well, let's say it does not end; it's left in the air.  I hate to disagree with the dominant opinion, but I could barely get past the first-half of the "kitsch," and, the second-half was only slightly more interesting, because it's so bizarre. The dialogue, of course, cuts in the author's favor (he's excellent), but I simply couldn't muster up all the ire and madness that this author tries to evoke. Yes, I've lived through the Age of AIDS, and it isn't pretty. Yes, like so many others, I continue to see friends and loves die, but I've never been THIS angry.   After all, anyone familiar with evolutionary biology could have predicted a viral or bacterial attack though sex of some kind. It's in nature, for gawd's sake. Unfortunately, it was a damn sneaky virus that operates like none that has preceded or followed it, just like evolutionary theory predicted it would (see, Matt Ridley's "Red Queen"). Even though it's shown itself to be gender-neutral, maybe, just maybe, raw promiscuity caused it to spread so far, so wide, and so quick. So let's acknowledge some responsibility. I know this doesn't go over well with the author's ultra-left orthodoxy, and maybe that's why I could not generate his level of angst and retribution.  While I have no tolerance for intolerance of the religious reich and the ultra-right wing, this kind of warmongering gets all of us nowhere. But if you need to revive your juices of hatred, this novel may be for you 
 The plastic case is sturdy and clear -- viewing the video screen through the plastic is not a problem.  There are, however, two major design flaws:  1. The cutout hole for the hold button is only slightly larger than the hold button itself.  Though this offers the best protection, it makes the hold button very difficult to reach, since the plastic is 3/32" thick.  2. The bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync/charge cable.  However, because of the proximity of the hinges, it's almost impossible to use the Apple-provided USB sync cable, since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug.  Once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged, a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable.    Because of these two faults, I cannot recommend this product.  It should have been tested more before going to market.  
 I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive "Journey of a Gemini", or "Blue Collar Music". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you.  
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 I have really enjoyed most of the Jury series, especially the interactions between Jury and Plant.  This book, however, fails to deliver in my opinion.  She starts off with a wonderful premise and could have really built upon it....but she didn't.  The book starts to become annoying because she gets lost in "educating" the reader on quantum physics.  I kept nodding off and wondering if I'd ever be able to finish this book.   I skimmed through so much of the last few chapters and still found that you're left hanging at the end.  It's not even the fact that Harry walks away in the end, it's more that Grimes fails to give anything in the story proper closure.    I don't really know what she was aiming at with this one, but it really missed the mark for me.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she seems to be tired of writing Jury.  Even Melrose Plant has lost some luster in this book and he usually shines through in most of them.    I noticed the next title in this series is "Dust" ... I fear that may be a literal description of this series at present.  It's dry as dust to me.  
 Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says "Family-Friendly" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now 
 The book sells for astronomical price because SOA chooses it. It's simple and standard material and there's about half a million people in this country who qualifies to write. Unless somebody else pays for you, go for another book, or a simple study notes will do 
 "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."  When she wrote these pieces, Cole clearly wasn't following Einstein's adage 
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.  
 All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER 
 This book is one of the worst books I have ever read, the author has no idea what's going on in LOST the portrayal of the characters is so off the mark that's it laughable I was so disappointed in this book that I actually threw it out in the rubbish bin. If you like LOST and need something to do in-between seasons or episodes bang you head against the wall it would be a far better use of your tim 
 I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends, and reading great reviews.  All of the reviews I read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has, but I never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak.  Don't get me wrong, I do not want my fragrance to enter a room before I do (after all, it is not the 80's anymore lol), but I also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that I take off skin!  The scent is beautiful, I would love to wear it!  But 20 minutes after I sprayed it on, I could barely detect the fragrance.  As sometimes it is harder to "smell your own perfume", I asked my hubby and friends for their opinions.  They could barely smell it either.  I would happily wear this scent every day if I could enjoy it at all.  If Philosophy can create this scent with staying power, they will have a customer for life.  As it stands now, I would not recommend anyone buy this product.  It is a very disappointing waste of money 
 I totally agree with Illana's review of this book:we, readers, don't get a deeper retelling of these traditional tales, but a veneer of sex and violence that gives them an "adult" appearance. While I found the sex and violence were totally superficial and unnecessary, and they didn't manage to move my profounder feelings, I felt deceived in my intention of going deeply into these beloved stories. I think that good fantasy writers often succeed in a deeper view on folk tales without announcing their intentions to the readers, but subtly letting them find similitudes in theme and characterization. Maybe this is because good fantasy writers let themselves be carried away by the powerful archetypal potential latent in everybody's mind and explored since the dawn of time through folk tales 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 Castillo tells a great story, even if there isn't much truth to it. Yes, all guerilla groups inevitably get involved with drugs. That's about where the truth ends. John Kerry's investigation went nowhere because there was no evidence, and he admitted that. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982. Bottom line: Castillo's book is not about drugs; it's a shameful attempt to rewrite history in favor of America's red enemies 
 What a disappointment! I love Tim Gunn on Project Runway and read the 5-star reviews waxing poetic about how wonderful this book was. I was left aghast with my jaw on the floor that this book is held in such high regard. Tim Gunn may know how to direct students when it comes to designing garments, but a writer he isn't. To say that Angelina Jolie is a style icon for her sloppy black t-shirts and jeans is hilarious. Do you really need someone to tell you how to throw out old clothes? If you haven't ever worn it, just toss it out...'nuff said.   This book is just common-sense written with horrible, pretentious vocabulary and nothing more. Save your money for a nice pair of sale-priced ballet flats, ladies. 
 As a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university, I find this book to be virtually worthless. Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon. A good postmodernist/ Marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful, but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off 
 I purchased "ABC's of Newborn Baby Care" and another video called "Bringing Baby Home". The "ABC's" video uses a baby who is not a newborn. The umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old. The video does go over basic care of how to hold, change, dress a baby, bottle cleaning and baths, but skips over the details I would have found useful. "Bringing Baby Home" by the Liandrea Company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents (no actors)and covers a wider range of information. I do not recomment ABC's of Newborn Baby Care as anything but a suppliment to another video 
 I am a serious poker player and am well read in finance (CFA), so i assumed the book would be a natural fit for my interests.  However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said "the book is confused" and the author's "editor did not reign him in properly".  It feels like the author is just rambling on without a specific point or idea.  It covers too many topics (off the top of my head: hand values, poker history, put-call parity, utility curves, psychology, horse races, society and wealth, then he adds some personal stories).  All those topics may have been feasible if they were weaved together better.  Unfortunately, he covers some topics superficially and some in painstaking detail.  Some areas are written for an audience unfamiliar with poker/finance, then other areas dive into advanced nuances.  The book is just not edited well enough to be a satisfying read 
 As an evolutionary biologist I was interested to read this book to see if it had any true merits.  Now that I have I see that it is a work of wonderful science fiction, not science.  It is quite apparent that the author has no formal training in evolutionary biology.  Much of the book is interesting and HIGHLY speculative, it provides little evidence for its wild claims.  In real science extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence but the author provides no convincing evidence for his claims.  Also, even if life did arrive here instead of the accepted method (which DOES have much evidence supporting it) it still does not refute Darwinian evolution.  Darwinian evolution is the ONLY mechanisms currently proposed which results in adaptation, the mere idea that individuals come to resemble alien life forms because their DNA is silent and "remembers" these forms is pure fantasy.  If this is the case how could there be adaptation on a foreign planet, and for that case how did these little "seeds" come to be created in the first place?  I could continue ripping this book apart but I've more important things to do.  I am very interested in astrobiology but as a scientist I realize that mere speculation is not science, no matter how enticing the theories may be.  Very good read if you're looking for science fiction, but don't bother if you know anything about evolutionary biology 
 I read this book about 20 years ago in high school and hated it. I just tried to read it again for a book club discussion. I thought that 20 years of life experience and growth may have changed my attitude toward this classic. It didn't. I made it half way through and decided to quit wasting my time. The characters are self-serving, and I just didn't care about them. The stream of consciousness style of writing is not my thing. 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 I too was sucked in by the flashy album cover and the title...but when I previewed the album at the store, I was sadly disappointed.  I listened to the first 12 tracks before I decided I had wasted enough time.  If you don't like rap, then DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!  Unless you drive a low-rider and listen to "Jungle Music," I find little value in it.  Track 12 is kind of a cool dance track, but hardly worth wasting your money for the entire album 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 the young actor is great in this movie, but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring.** 
 Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars. 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 I'm ashamed at myself for even reading this garbage 
 Anyone who has read Stephen Ambrose knows that precise historical accuracy is not the main focus of his writing. To the contrary, his aims seem to lie closer to promoting super-human efforts and painting people as heroes regardless of the body of evidence before him. This book is no different, with the subject matter not nearly as interesting as some of his other works such as Crazy Horse & Custer, or Undaunted Courage. In fact, Nothing Like It stands at the bottom of the list of Ambrose books that I have read, and possibly marks the end of the Ambrose literary experiment for me.  The issue isn't that he doesn't write interesting books. He sometimes does, though in this specific case it's highly questionable. The problem is that he doesn't engage in the accurate retelling of history. Now I'll be the first to admit that history is often times subjective. But there needs to be some sort of balance. Given the Union Pacific's duo of Durant and Dodge were highly corrupt and never paid their workers, it's hard to constantly laud these 2 men as heroes, as Ambrose often does. It would be more accurate if these men were painted as 2 of the first big time corporate crooks in America. The evidence is in the book, if you pay attention to it. To that end, I'll give Ambrose credit for at least divulging these facts, even if he does absurdly gloss over it by saying, "Boys will be boys."  Nothing Like It In the World tells of the fantastic struggle to bridge the country with an iron road, a feat that in itself is hard enough to conceive. Throw in the fact that this occurred in a time when slavery was ending and the country was divided by the Civil War, and the accomplishment becomes even more impressive. The feats of engineering and the sheer willpower of the Chinese and Irish workers (not to forget the Mormons) is mind boggling. Struggles against the weather of the high Sierras and a race against the competing railroad give us an interesting look at one of the most colossal feats in American engineering history.  But enough with the sensationalism. The men who financed and organized the road were crooks, much as today's Enron executives and Wall Street high rollers are. They were involved for fastidious financial gain, and little else save for having their names recorded in the annals of American history motivated them. In short, they yearned for money and power. Ironically, and perhaps fittingly, many of these men died of relatively ordinary financial means, and only Stanford's name is now recognized by the common man, and only because of the University, not because of the railroad.  The book is mildly entertaining, but too much of it is saturated with Ambrose's gung ho attitude that America is the Greatest Great thing that ever tried to be Greatly Great. Anyone with a tenth of a brain will tire of this early on in the narrative. It's just not good material, to pick up a history book and get hints of comic book hero-worship on the pages. The guy tried hard to be an historical institution unto himself, and a lot of times he missed the mark completely, this book included.  I don't know much about books that rival this work, but I would bet dollars to doughnuts there are dozens of books better suited to tell this story, and most of them will probably leave the "rah rah America" stuff out of it. I suggest looking for one of them 
 There was a time that an artist selling a 1.000 records could claim to be a bigger seller than Rod Steward. It should have stayed this way. Instead Rod chose to come back with his interpretation of the American Songbook.   It has been an insult to both the songbook and the legendary artists who've contributed to it over time. It is hard to imagine that those who've been enamored by the likes of Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, and Louis Armstrong or even Tony Bennet could find any beauty in these records.  With the first release I hoped it would stay at that. But Rod's audience caught on. Surprisingly the critics didn't kill him as well. Thinking I missed something before I forced myself to listen to it again. Only to find that the releases are a horror. His deliverance and timing are completely off and the arrangement are unimaginative. Rod Steward doesn't ad anything to the American Songbook, he tears it down. This boxed set is totally uncalled for. Not only because of the weakness in material, also because it just repackages the previous material without adding something to it considerably.   Rod should stick to the beautiful Soulful Rock he did in his heyday and leave well enough alone. I'd advise everyone to stay away from this and stick with the classics. 
 He could very well be Jack and not Mark because he repeats the phrase "Jump In" ad nauseam. I was reminded of the Rolling Stones song "Jumping Jack Flash" which is a classic but I digress.  It is a story of rags-to-riches told in somewhat candid manner. However, the author doesn't give a glimpse of his past and his psychology other than urging the reader to Jump In (there you go again). His life as a commando as well as his past in England are not told so the story lacks the foundation and thus robs the reader the opportunity to truly discover how Mark's brilliant mind functions.  The book is peppered with motivational phrases and if you want to get 'pumped up' (this could be the title of Mark's sequel) then just read the sidebars of the book. It is a forgettable book, overall. 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I'm sure this was a fun video in its time, but the moves are just too 80's 
 (This review is incorrectly tagged as 1-star when it should be 3-star) Aron Ralston's "Between a Rock and a Hard Place" is on the one side a mesmerizing account of an ordeal most of us could never hope to survive, and on the other a fragmented journal of a mountaineer's conquest of mostly 14,000 feet winter summits in Colorado. The link between the two is just not satisfactorily made to me, except to parade adventures that mostly suggests an individual that thrives on danger in remote areas.  When Aron focuses on the unique adventure of his entrapment and escape he delivers a powerful and passionate story, littered with keen observations and compelling writing. But in order to read the truly unique and fascinating story you have to wade through detailed accounts of obscure mountain hikes and skiing trips that at times seem reckless and foolhardy.   I'm neither a mountaineer nor a summit skier, and at times Aron doesn't seem to be writing to the likes of me using many technical terms that only rock climbers or mountaineers would understand. Can I recommend the book? Absolutely. The story is worth the tough ride and sidetracks he makes the reader take, although by the end you may know more about Colorado's peaks than Utah's canyons where the real adventure takes place 
 I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused.  The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through 
 This book is not what you want, you don't learn much as most of the guides are half done on an enclosed CD. Also, it does not cover much on action script, which i believe is one of the main aspects of Flash Mx. There are better books out there that teach you to create flash objects from scratch (meaning you won't end up in a confused mess thinking, how did they do that). on the plus, the book is clear, well presented and a few of the projects are easy to follow. in my opinion there are better books on the market 
 I found little to no new information on tennis in this book.  Granted, I am a tennis fanatic, but I was hoping for some new tidbit or anecdote, neither of which I got 
 I am assuming, since you are reading this review, you are familiar about Sopranos. This writeup is not meant to be a critique of the series (the series is absolutely brilliant), rather the wierd pricing strategy associated with this particular set. I really do not understand this! How can the same group of people who have created one of the most amazing TV series of our times, can get their pricing strategy so wrong? It is possible to buy the five seasons separately a lot cheaper from Amamzon.com. One is supposed to get a premium for buying by the bulk and not pay a premium. If you are a fan of the series (who isn't) and still have successfully resisted the temptation to purchase the series (miracles still happen) then I strongly recommend immediate purchase of the five seasons separately. Do not buy them together and end up paying extra dollars, rather purchase the seasons separately, save some money and buy Friends (the TV series) or Casablanca with the balance or go out to dinner with your family or any thing else. Just please do not drop your hard earned money down the drain. 
 The guy who wrote this claims a lot of things. No proof to back it up though.  He wrote it because he thought that the Vietnam conflict was going to escalate to WWIII but it didn't. 
 Lots of fun for the little ones. However, the 'nose' part is not fun at all because some of these cute kids need a good nose cleaning. I wonder how much time was put into creating this DVD, and and on the kids' cleanliness 
 This is junk fiction. The plot is unbelievably naive. The  twists of events are ridiculous with no seemingly logical reasoning- especially how Sam and Frieda got together again through Ilene (yes, the person who first opposed their relationship). The story could be condensed to a third of its original length. Unless you have lots of time on hand, please do not waste it on this book 
 Robert Baker wrote in, They Call It Hypnosis, "Hypnosis does not exist, has never existed in the past, and will not exist in the future."  Either the author of this pseudoscience has not read it, or has the same, "If the marks will buy it, what does it matter if it is disinformative?"  indifference to reality as the TV networks. Forty years of touring with successful concert hypnotists who also practised hypnotherapy has left not the slightest doubt in my mind that Baker is right.  
 Just imagine if the back cover of this hilarious atheist manifesto featured the (generally respected) Publishers Weekly review: "God's defenders deserve a better critique than this misanthropic rant". Not many published books from respectable publishing companies get labeled as misanthropic rants but here the label is very apt. Atheists should be embarrassed by this book. The job of adequately summarizing what such a diverse group of God's defenders believes is hard enough, let alone show in 150 pages why they are wrong. Joshi is either hopelessly ambitious or just crazy if he thinks he can accomplish serious demolition work like this. But, you say, why don't you actually read the book before you judge it by its cover? Well, I did...and it got even more pathetic. Joshi completely caricatures just about everybody's position, but especially C.S. Lewis. Just one example: Joshi asserts that Lewis was ignorant of Darwinism and was actively hostile to it. On the contrary, in many of his essays he shows a very good understanding of evolutionary theory, even agreeing with modern materialistic thinkers that evolution as such supports no notion of progress. He also sufficiently understood the implications of evolutionary epistemology to mount a critique of naturalism based on the evolutionary origin of our cognitive faculties, decades before Plantinga did the same thing with more sophistication. Now, to be fair, some of Joshi's points do hit the mark. G.K. Chesterton was a bit eccentric in some of his argumentation and he did employ the 'complete reversal' tactic a bit too often. But that pales compared to his incredible insights on his time and prophetically on our own time. You judge a writers work and believes in their totality, not in isolated circumstances. The writing is full of invective, "sound and fury signifying nothing", no hint of sophistication or intellectual maturity. Since Joshi cannot produce work of comparable genius and impact to William James, Annie Dillard, or C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton for that matter, he parasitically gains notoriety by means of this laughable, totally inadequate critique. If there's one good thing I hope this book can do, though, it is to prompt readers (and I hope they do) to read the works of God's Defenders for themselves, and see how they measure up to Joshi's polemic. Who knows, it may even convince people of the absurdity of atheism and make a believer out of them 
 This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.  
 Yes, indeed! The booklet included is nice and glossy. Thanks! And the two documentaries added this time around are nice too. Thanks again! But what about the film itself? Has that been given the deluxe treatment as well? Sad answer: Definitely NOT! As a matter of fact, this new "re-master" looks much worse than the previous DVD. That one was a very fuzzy non-anamorphic mess, but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy. In fact, when I put the old one in the zoom mode, there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever. And the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition. But worst of all, is that the new DVD is cropped on all four sides! There is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc, especially on top of the frame! So much for a Deluxe Edition! Shame on you, Sony/MGM-UA! Fans of this film - myself included - will have to keep the old DVD, and get this new one for the extras and the booklet. (The 2 stars above are for those inclusions alone.) This is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film 
 see through.  I don't wear it because it is so thin it is see thru.  maybe a darker color would of been better but this powder blue sucked 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 My favorite from this one had to be the fat guy's comment -- "I'd be a rich man if I had a dime for every hour i've spent auditing Pentagon departments" -- what - he doesn't make more than $0.10 per hour?  In 1987?  Give me a break.  Yes, these are great page turners.  But the dialog is absolutely horrendous.    Shakespeare, he is not.   
 ...falls short of delivering. First, the book does not cover creative thinking, or creative greatness. You better look for other great books on building creative thinking like "Cracking Creativity". Second, every page confirms the writer's background of a lawyer. While thinking, especially the unthinkable is undeniably very important in the court, the writer is kind of trapped in a "black/white" world. True vs. lie with topics such as "concentrate on crucial facts" or "always make sure..". Well, that might work in the court, but helps one little in thinking out of the box / thinking creatively. Thus, worst rating possible 
 Mamet is both a celebrated playwright and one of the most chauvinist and ethnocentric nationalists extant. If a traditional Catholic were to say about the pope and the Church what Mamet says about rabbis and the Synagogue in this book, he would be denounced as a reactionary bigot and hardly taken seriously. Instead, by some sleight of hand he may have picked up from his stage-magician pal Ricky Jay, Mamet's Judaic jingoism is transformed into a progressive appeal. To what? Blind faith in dogma and ideology as a path to salvation? Did anyone ever hear of the Enlightenment? Thank God for Pfefferkorn, Spinoza, Shahak, Chomsky, Kaye, Finkelstein and all the other "apostates" who had the courage and integrity to break free. Read this book as a case study in megalomania and paranoia from one of the grandees directing contemporary culture in America. 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment

 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This book includes basic information on mood disorders, including major depression, mania, and hypomania, all components of what used to be called manic-depression and is now known as bipolar disorder.  I found other books more helpful as far as scientific knowledge and explication.  I found Kay Redfield Jamison's books insightful, inspiring, as well as incredibly knowledgeable.  I found this book annoying, and it relied too heavily on the double whammy of an explanation or point made by one of the medical authors with a lay person follow-up by Nancy, a patient with bipolar disorder whose experiences and anecdotes are leaned on heavily throughout the book.   In trying to warm up what they perhaps feared might be an overly objective, medical reference book, which it is far, far from being anyway, the authors used Nancy as a device to humanize the condition.    I got very tired of Nancy and her loopy examples.  When not preening over the authors' attention as the pet subject of the book, she was just illogical and somewhat strident or annoying.  She had a very definite "voice," which to me was loud and probably possessing a strong New York accent.  I feel for Nancy and her experiences with this disorder, but her examples had no resonance for me and detracted from any actual information.   Go for Jamison definitely and browse through some other newer sources.  Skip this one 
 This is missing "Tapioca Tundra" & "D.W. Washburn"!  What's up with that?  What was Rhino thinking?  Just save up a few more bucks and go for the 4-cd box set.  That has everything and then some 
   Over the years I have had an avid interest in the paranormal.  I have read books by numerous authors, and looked forward to this book being one of the best.  I found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost,and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it.  I have taken my law enforcement training and experience, and coupled it with other books on this subject, and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar.  I am afraid that this book,apart from the poor spelling, and composition would be confusing to novice investigators, and would give them erroneous information, on a subject that is complicated to begin with.  I am sure Mr.Taylor means well, but there are much better books out there for the beginner,or the experienced investigator. The later version is no real improvement eithe 
 This brand new kettle - after having been cleaned, descaled with vinegar  (at Proctor Silex's suggestion), filled with a solution of water and baking soda (at Proctor-Silex's suggestion) reeks of a chemical, plastic smell, which it imparts to any water boiled in it.  We're returning it immediately. Feh 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 This is an awful movie. No chemistry between the characters, the plot is ridiculous. 
 That is what this book deserves, a big fat zero. This stuff was treated in much greater depth by business thought leaders several years ago. Notions of inter-enterprise process engineering, powered by the Internet, were rigorously documented several years ago. This professor turned management prophet must have spent his millions derived from his previous book of "stories" --circa 1993-- and needed a new source of funds as the world went far past him and his business process rengineering (BPR) stories, long ago. This guy writes stories, not first principles upon which companies can act. Ever tried to "implement" a story? Save your money --buy Tapscott, Fingar, Weil or Hagel books on the subject 
 You have the whole movie in a nutshell from the above plot description.  However, it was just plain awful!  I love all types of horror movies and I will admit that I saw this one.  The whole thing was just a mess.  The acting was so bad that you were cheering on the croc to kill off the actors.  If you want to waste some time and have to see this one I would suggest that you borrow it from someone who has it or wait for a re-run of this on the sci-fi channel.  Save your $ 
 I just bought this cd tonight and Im sorry ITS TRASH!! I was hoping to hear some of the songs like This Christmas....done in a more traditional manner with some soul...instead I got some EXTRA ish! She has songs on here that dont even sound like Christmas music...she has chopped up the original of This christmas to make it sound like some slooow molasses song...she DRAGS out notes/songs FOREVER! Its ridiculous...I tell you Faith....wont get my money again for a long long time 
 The first cd was fantastic.  Great upbeat songs. The new one is slow and depressing.  If I didn't know better, I would swear it was a completely different band.  I went from loving these guys to wishing I hadn't spent the money on the second cd. Very disappointing follow up 
 Good premise and story line, for the most part a decent dialog, outstanding acting (except for the sleepwalking Gyllenhaal), so what's missing?  What's missing is plausibility.  A movie about grief doesn't have to dwell on it, but it MUST show early on that the grief is there.  If this is done properly, the viewer will accept even the most outlandish behavior as a character's way of dealing with that grief.  Kasdan did it brilliantly in 'The Big Chill,' with a mere thirty seconds of Glenn Close sobbing in the shower.  Silbering failed to do anything like that in `Moonlight Mile,' so the eccentric parents and the goofy fiance seem uncaring and preoccupied only with themselves.  I couldn't overcome it, even though I tried for a good while.  By the time Gyllenhaal bares his soul in court it's way too late; what might otherwise have been quite affecting seems only outlandish.        
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges 
  Psychiatry has always mentioned the brain and its parts. They use technical terms in reference to actual parts of the brain. However thier knowledge of mental illness is purely subjective. Meaning they only speculate as a group or panel then "diagnose" the illness by only labeling. Its strange but true. This is how they do it.   The fact that mental illness has no biological proof is the painful truth about psychiatry.  
 I wish I could have paged through this book before I got it.  Based on the title, I was hoping that the book would discuss economic developments, new markets, new theories, or new technologies that would lead met to make better investments.  Instead, I'd call this book more of a "technical analysis" piece.  It's basic premise is that stocks move in 20 year cycles, and the cycle for large cap growth stocks ended in 2000.  Therefore, put your money in small cap stocks and large cap value.  It's possible that some readers who invest in mutual funds will find this book useful, although they would have been better served had it been published in 2000.  However, the book does not discuss, let alone even reference, techniques of analyzing individual stocks.    So what if many stocks got creamed in 2000? You didn't need to be a market historian to see that coming when p/e ratios and other indicia of valuation were so out of whack.  Anyone following the value methodologies of Ben Graham ("Intelligent Investor") or Chris Browne ("Little Book of Value Investing") avoided getting slammed.    The book's basic premise is that by market timing specific sectors, individual investors can achieve outsized returns.  I am skeptical that most investors will find this to be the case.   Even the title to this book is arguably misleading.  The book is not truly contrarian - it's about interpreting historic market trends to predict the future.  Anyone who has read a mutual fund prospectus can tell you that the SEC requires a statement to the effect that "past performance does not indicate future results" - readers would be well advised to keep that warning in mind.    If you want to read good books on contrarian investing, get David Dreman's "Contrarian Investing Strategies: the Next Generation," or one of the numerous books on behavioral finance that are available (example: Belsky & Gilovich's "Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes" or Paulos' "A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market.").  Sadly, I wish I had taken a pass on this book 
 More tripe about how one "man" discovered other humans.  The "objective" view of this man as a hero is still present, helping to perpetuate the myth that Natives were not as valuable as the oppressors who came to colonize them.  I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth.  You might be able to use it in a discussion of racism and the epestimologies that help create and foster it.  There are plenty of Italian people who were heroes, this person is just not one of them.  
 This item was supposed to have a lid as you can see above.  No lid in box 
 My daughter tried the mat once and hasn't asked to play with it again.  Unfortunately, this is probably just another toy that will take up space.  Colored squares on the screen indicate where to step, but the mat does not have the same corresponding colors.  This, just one of many downfalls of this product, makes it very confusing for a 4-5 year old to follow.  Not recommended at all 
 One of the best books I have ever read. It was engaging and informative and read like a great novel. I did not want it to end 
 I love Daniel Stell books but this one was horible.I have to admit I didn't finsh it but I got tired of how her husband treated her and she did nothing about it.But from what I've read from other readers I didn't miss much by not finshing it 
 This book is sappy, whiny sentimentalism at best -- a sad tribute to the author's need for exhibitionism more than anything. If you're interested in learning how many times a week Dianea Kohl-Riise masturbates or her children's poor opinion of her -- look no further. This book is self-help, all right-- self-help for Dianea, and Dianea alone. 
 The movie itself is a snoozer.  There's a good amount of physical comedy, but the story just went nowhere.  However, the running commentary is hilarious!  When the commentary is funnier than the movie, you know the movie is pretty bad 
 The old phone I had was heavy, and the battery life was horrible. You have to put this phone on the charger every night or you won't have a phone in the morning even if you don't use it that much. I thought for the price that it would be the best phone in the world. To my suprise the only great thing is that it's not heavy 
 A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.  
 Another series of theses full of superlatives that fail to capture any meaningful understanding of what is happening in Iran:  Here, religion is bad, good and evil are simplified/linear and all is either surreal or superficial. It ignores the larger Iran as a whole and focuses on two marginal but very visible groups, the semi-intellectual immigrants outside and the semi-intellectual urbanites inside. All the while, 2/5 of Iran's population lives in rural areas. Of those in urban areas, a large number are rural transplants who are religious and fanatic but literate and vocal. Where are the analyses and stories of these real Iranians who decide the fate of the country?  Iran is not a country hijacked by a group of aliens, as most Western intellectuals portray it (as they do in this book), it is much more complex and full of dichotomies and contradictions that cannot be broken down into bite sized one-size-fits-all analysis.    Ms. Nafisi should coordinate a tour of rural schools, Mr. Aslan should spend a year doing field research in out of way places in Iran, and Ms. Satrpai would benefit from light stroll in the slums of Southern Tehran.  Read this for its amusing self-deception than its claim to be a real window into the soul of Iran.   
  I had a bit of trouble rating this one; I was tempted to give it a three but ultimately was forced to decide on a 2. If Amazon offered a 2 1/2 choice, I would have used it.  Don't get me wrong - I didn't dislike this book. It had it's good points but the negatives couldn't allow me to give it a 3 as an average rating. For the positive side of things, this book is massive, pretty, well organized, and written in a simple to understand manner.   It's from the staff of Herbs for health, which includes many herbalists that are recommendable such as Christopher Hobbs. The main author of this book is Linda B. White, M.D., followed by Steven Foster. While I commend Ms. White for writing herbals and having an M.D. at the same time  - we need more physicians taking alternate healing seriously - I felt the book was a bit too cautious and at time allopathic orientated.   Within every condition, there lay herbal recommendations....with prescription drug names and uses. In fact, drug names are listed first :( If this is a book on healing and herbs and natural remedies, why does it have to again share its pedestal? And even worse, be placed second when the book is supposed to be about it in the first place? If this Herbal Drugstore is supposed to be the options to prescriptions and over the counter drugs, then why list them so often in every section with details? At least their side effects are listed, which makes them appear a bit frightening in comparison. For those who really do want to know the name of each prescription drug used to treat asthma, angina, or any other condition, then here you'll find it.  Steven Foster was the co-writer for Tyler's honest herbal, which is an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Tyler's honest herbal remains one of the most hated books of the herbal profession, and for good reason. Fosters contribution there may also have been too cautious, although one isn't sure how much he really had to do with it. I am surprised someone who devotes so much time to herbs and even a magazine about them is so overly cautious, but that seems to be the current trend.  I did greatly appreciate some sections such as "How Herbs are Regulated" and common herb/drug interactions. The former is an interesting addition that's not seen enough, and was told honestly. There is a great simple reference guide at the beginning in a table where a condition is named, then commonly used drugs, then the herbal alternatives beside them.   The section on conditions is extensive enough and does offer more recommendations than herbs, as well as the occassional cool remedy/formula. Many of these seem like decent to good blends, particularly blister balm, Endometriosis Tea, and Swimmer's Ear Drops. Typical dosage is given for each herb, including teas or pills or tinctures, which is welcome.   The final  half wraps up with very short comments on herbs, basically stating uses without complete sentences as a quick reference to herbs already covered elsewhere in the book. After these are the typical references and resources.  Overall this book is not bad but it's just so plain in terms of natural therapy. It's for the basic, basic lay person who only has a passing interest in herbal therapies. Here they're treated almost like little drugs beside other drugs, as alternatives, and no mention really on other herbal uses, as in holistic healing, etc. Diet is mentioned at times, and this is appreciated, but everything is so cautionary as seems to be found with these kinds of  books lately.  Because of this, it can only be granted a low score. Not enough information per condition, with drugs listed FIRST, then herbs, and not much info on the herbs either. Too cautionary and medical minded to be a highly recommended herbal, but alright for the passerby who just wants to take a look 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 I've never really been a fan of Ben Stiller, but I picked this one up for Janeane's writing.  Unfortunately, neither one of them delivered.  While Janeane's writing was a bit better than Ben's, it was still pretty horrific.  Between the two of them, they couldn't even get a mild chuckle out of me.  Definitely not worth the time or effort 
 Don't buy this film, as the censor has blacked out certain parts.If films are being sold censored it should be made clear at point of purchas 
 Rendezvous with Rama is an excellent book.  Rama II is one of the worst, most poorly written books I have ever read.  Lee would get an F in any creative writing class.  Please, do not waste your money on this clich?d, idiotic, boring book 
 In today's world not many woodworkers make things by hand. The book is hard to work with, difficult to find basic stock requirements and measurements. I would not buy again 
 I saw this dvd and thought it was a bargain .... Was I wrong. It contains 3 great films all spoilt by the worst transfer I have ever seen. The picture is far worse than the vhs I have and it also keeps freezing and pixelating. I have the reg 2 version of Immortal battalion and it is a fantastic transfer. Avoid this dvd at all costs 
 	The title and cover description of this book are  very misleading.  It contains very little practical advice for dealing with "mean girls" who abuse you.  It is mostly about preventing YOURSELF from being a "mean girl", even in response to the real mean girls.  In fact, the author admonishes us not to even defend or protect ourselves.  As the director of Luke 17:3 Ministries for adult children of controlling or abusive birth-families (please visit our website), I take issue with much of what the author says.  Referring to Scripture, she states she "couldn't find commands or even recommendations that would suggest you need to stand up for yourself in order to protect yourself", a concept that we clearly debunk on our site, which gives many examples of scriptures about rebuking and standing up against evil.    	She "can't find" these Scriptures because she manipulates the Scriptures she chooses to use to make her point.  I have no trouble finding quite a few of them (One of them is Luke 17:3, which our ministry is named for). I was amazed to read her take on Matthew 18:15-17, in which Jesus tells us "If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you.  If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.  But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.  If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector."(NIV)  	The version of the Bible she chooses to use in her book is the New American Standard (NASB) (disavowed by its own author- see *** below), in which the above scripture omits the words AGAINST YOU, and merely says, "If your brother sins...."  	Incredibly, she then goes on to try and discredit almost every other version of the Bible that does not conform to her ideas.  She states, "If your Bible translation says "sins against you", the "against you" was more than likely not part of the original text but was translated that way to get across the idea that someone can sin against God by doing something to you."  What?  "More than likely not part of the original text?" Is it or isn't it? What kind of scholar on the original text is she? Where is she getting this stuff from?    	I checked The King James Version (KJV), New International Version (NIV), New Living Translation (NLT), the Open Bible, and the New King James Version (NKJV) and they all include the words "against you" or "against thee."  I also checked two Bibles I have which are over 100 years old. One was published in 1900 by the American Bible Society, and the other was published by the International Bible Agency and William Collins in London and Glasgow and has an inscription from 1894.  Both state they are " translated out of the original tongues; and with the former translations diligently compared and revised."  And they both include the words " trespass against thee" in Matthew 18:15.  	The King James version was originally published in 1611, and yet the author chooses to use the NASB, which was published in 1971, and claim that it is more accurately translated than all the other Bibles, including those which predate it.  How she knows what kinds of "ideas" the translators were "trying to get across", especially hundreds of years ago, is beyond me.  It seems that she is the one who takes liberties with the Scriptures to get across her own ideas.        ***Concerning the NASB which the author uses, one of its own creators has disavowed it.  In New Age Bible Versions by G. A. Riplinger (author recommendation page preceding table of contents), Dr. Frank Logsdon, the co-founder of the NASB, is quoted:  "I must under God renounce every attachment to the New American Standard Version.  I'm afraid I'm in trouble with the Lord....it's frighteningly wrong; and what am I going to do about it?.....the deletions are absolutely frightening.....there are so many.....Are we so naive that we do not suspect Satanic deception in all of this?....(You) can say the Authorized Version (KJV) is absolutely correct.  100% correct!" (from Strongman's His Name II by Drs. Jerry & Carol Robeson)  	Another eye-popper, guaranteed to offend all of us "brainless gals" is the author's explanation of the difference in styles of communication between men and women. "Men usually communicate like a football game.....they always have a goal in mind."  "Women, on the other hand, usually communicate like a game of Twister.......the goal for women often isn't anything more than just speaking- most of the time, we don't have a point......we don't need to figure anything out;  we just need to dump and then we are all better."    	Wait, it gets better. "If you are used to guy talk, hanging out with women might be a little challenging to you.  It was for me.  Gab, gab, gab (in italics!).  But remember, with girls, you can interrupt, change the subject, and make comments.  It's girlese.  Watch how they talk and start to notice their need to just blab." OMGosh! Welcome back to 1953!  This is not coming from a bunch of good ol-boys- it's a WOMAN blatantly and unflatteringly stereotyping other women!        I have no clue as to what, if any, qualifications this author has, but these are just a few examples of the bizarre and outrageous assumptions and statements you will find in this book.  	If you enjoy the rush of your blood pressure going through the roof, buy this book.  But if you are looking for real, constructive help in protecting yourself from the "meanies" in your life, this is not the book for you.  I highly recommend "Boundaries" by Cloud & Townsend for a Christian guide to protecting yourself from abusive people.    	 	 
 I felt that despite the glossy, attractive cover & reputation of the author, this guide was dated and limited.  Its section on exhortation works from a very limited conception of exhortation being a form of rebuking- not also the concept of encouraging and inspiring that is now commonly accepted in contemporary Christianity.  Its typeface looks dated, and fill-in sections have very limited, dated-looking lined areas.  There are no graphics or flow-of-eye tools that are found in other publications (such as Willow Creek stuff).  Keep looking, I'm going to 
 At this juncture, I've only had opportunity to read the publisher's summary and a reader review, wherein the author's concentration on the U.S. data is majored.  But, "the sixties" were not a uniquely American  phenomenon.  Rather, virtually the whole world convulsed in the sixties  (see, e.g., South America; Europe) and these countries were free from such  influences as Viet Nam and the American style of child-rearing.  Thus, the  true root (and an informative understanding) of "the sixties"  must be sought beyond -- as well as within -- our borders 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I'm a loyal Orton fan; Trailer Park is her best, and I'm a fan the "other side of daybreak". This cd is a complete disappointment. It is trite, boring, and political in a very dull and usual way; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness, charm, and melancholy that so characterize most of Orton's work. I get the distinct feeling that she didn't have this cd in her, but just put it out there because there were so many (ourselves) who were waiting. Orton's merit is that her songs come from her heart; these songs come from her head. These songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop, and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden.  We wish Beth the best; but we also wish she would give us her best; and if she can't do that, well, we'll be content with her 'classics' 
 I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  Even though that's possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  I can't believe Panasonic thinks they'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective 
 After hearing and reading a number of astonishing things about this book, I had to give it a read.  What I found was not exactly what I expected.  While some sources have described the Dru character as a "sinister dictator", the truth is not quite so interesting.  The book itself is nowhere near as interesting.  Upon opening the book to the table of contents, one can't help but take notice of the number of chapters in this book.  There are 53 chapters in just 173 pages!  For those of you who don't have a math minor, that's a little over 3 pages per chapter.  And for some reason, many of the chapters are explicit continuations of the chapter before.  What was the point of this?  Why not keep the two chapters a single chapter?   Needless to say, the writing here is atrocious.  The plot is paper-thin, the characters don't develop one iota, and a romance sub-plot rears its ugly head on the last two pages of the book!  How was this book published?  Why was it put into print?  Therein lies the intrigue.  While it was anonymously written at the time, it is today well-known that the author of this book was Colonel Edward Mandell House (he gives a little hint in the text when two characters meet at Mandell House [yeesh!]), who was the virtual co-president of the United States with Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson admitted time and again that House was his "alter ego", even to the point that House was given accomodations in the White House.  Why is all this important?  Philip Dru leads a revolution against the United States government.  Not a bad thing in and of itself, if the reasons had been more compelling.  What happens in the aftermath, however, brings shudders to students of history.  Philip Dru becomes dictator of the United States, without too much reservation.  He tosses out the national constitution, as well as the state constitutions, and has them rewritten.  He institutes a graduated income tax (which did not exist at that time in the U.S. because it was ruled unconstitutional;  however, with the "ratification" of the 16th amendment just a year or two after the publication of this book, we got one for the first time and have lived under it ever since), forces popular election of senators, nationalizes industry, and reorganizes the entire government at his whim.  And Dru is definitely portrayed as the friendly protagonist.  If the First Lady were to write a book calling for revolution, abolition of the constitution, and a unitary dictator, would we worry?  I sure hope so.    But more worrisome is the fact that all of these thing eventually did come to pass in this country.  (Sure, the constitution wasn't abolished and rewritten.  However, the New Deal Supremee Court made rulings that effectively gave Congress carte-blanche to pass ANY law it felt like, even those that explicitly violate the constitution [see USA PATRIOT Act]).  Was House prescient?  Did he simply see the tides of popular opinion swarming over the masses?  Or was he simply one of the many manipulating the domestic policy of our republic behind the scenes?  The structure and execution of this book are amateurish at best, more likened to the writing of a 10th grader than any kind of real author.  Perhaps that is the point.  This book was clearly aimed at the unwashed masses.  Every piece of dialog in this book espouses the benefits of socialism and evil of capitalism.  But this effort is so transparent that it leaves us with nothing of any literary merit, and in its place only political ramblings of a clear Fabian socialist.  These ramblings, of course, entail bringing up relevant issues and injustices (female suffrage, corporate exploitation) and packaging them with solutions that involve only the addition and centralization of power in the federal government.  While those who educate themselves will see this work for what it is, the many people who read this book (not today, since people don't read, but back then there were probably more than a few) would end up buying into bad solutions for exaggerated problems.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this book.  The price simply doesn't justify it.  A reader will gain no enjoyment from it.  This book only redeems itself in its historical context:  it was written by a man who pushed Woodrow Wilson to sign the Federal Reserve Act, which destroyed our economy and continues to devalue our money to this day;  to lead us into World War I, despite his campaign promises not to (the Lusitania was carrying English munitions and was a valid military target); and to attempt to sacrifice the sovereignty of our nation to a world governing body in the League of Nations, which our Congress rightly rejected 
 This book is really boring.  It's language is confusing, its references to other obscure pieces of literature are too complex, and it just really stinks 
 Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with, and found these.  i probably just expected too much out of them, being about $8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much.  Well, me and a friend began shooting at each other, and the BBs curved largely to the left.  Not just a little, but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left.  They're really light (although expected with cheap guns) and have a really clumsy feel.  They at least look kind of neat, and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator (looks only).  I later bought a $30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far, and shoots straight.  These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns.  Dont expect to win with these, unless you're fighting other people with the same thing.  And on another note, my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off.  He wasnt pressing hard, it was just weak defective plastic.  
 I was extremely disappointed with this product; I felt very let down by Sony, because for years I bought Sony items with confidence, knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable.  This item only goes to prove that Sony's standards have dropped and, as such I will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs. What lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up; 2 metres (not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping) was the best I could do, and that was in a straight line.  No, all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin 
 I absorb "foodie" books at the rate that some breathe.  Reichl, Bourdain, Child, Buxton and others are the source of hours of fond distraction from my too-busy-to-do-anything life and my aspirations to understand food the way I understand my professional work -- intuitively, technically and personally.  I had read that this book was more of a bawdy personal history than others, but I always adore the personal details of the writers, and am hardly a prude. Nevertheless, I could hardly muster an ounce of empathy for the gratuitous sexual self-objectification of the author who viewed restaurants more as stars in a social strata than producers of cuisine.  I did not care about her tortured relationship with a porn star, whom she fed and bedded on her employer's dime.  I grew exasperated as she ended a chapter about three marriages with a confession that she wrote it without understanding the point, and still, after writing it and choosing to include it in her book, she did not.  The simple reality is that a writer is speaking to a reader, and Ms. Green's reader appeared to be...Ms. Green.  While it is apparent that others enjoyed this book, I would suspect that a day with "Garlic and Sapphires" would disabuse anyone of the notion that this is a delightful memoir, and instead expose it for the indulgence that it is 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Some people complain that this book has no romance.  Others complain that the mystery is too dark.  My complaint is that I don't know what world Kay Hooper's characters are operating in but it isn't our world.  Never mind the fact that the major premise of this series is that there is a special unit of FBI agents who have psychic powers.  I can live with that.  I can live with them facing a host of otherworld nasties.  What I can't put up with is the failure of basic common sense.  For instance.  There is a maid at a fancy resort who is pregnant by one of the guests.  She is worried about her pregnancy showing because she knows she is going to be fired.  What!?!   Then what will she do to support herself?  What!?!  First, if they fire her because she is pregnant she gets a lawyer and sues their money out of their pocket.  She also notifies the father that he has another mouth to feed and had better get ready to hand over child support.    I've seen this nonesense in romance novels so often that I kind of expect it there, but this is not supposed to be a romance.  Now, as to the mystery part:  this special FBI unit would be far better off if they would stop depending on their psychic abilities so much and do a little gum shoeing.  A child is kidnapped and taken far from the place where she was last seen to a cabin in the mountains. Our dauntless FBI agents find her by psychic means (This isn't a spoiler, it's part of the back story)  and 1) do not take the child to the hospital for examination; 2) do not call in forensic people to search and process the cabin for evidence of the identity of the abductor; and 3) do not seem to follow up at all in a rational, FBI sort of way.    So if you want no romance with all the romance nonsense about the way the world works, a mystery that could have been solved briskly with a little digging into the circumstances and characters that are paper thin at best, then grab this book at once.   
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I am just ordering the book. Have not read it yet 
 I like that you can customize your workout or use a pre programed one. There is the option of only having music and no talking which is nice. The cardio segments are about 13 minutes each and the toning segments are about 5. There is a total toning segment and it is about 10 minutes. The cardio didn't get my heart beat elevated like some other dvds I have. The toning segments had good exercises, but my muscles didn't feel tired after doing them. I think this dvd is geared more towards beginners 
 After watching The Commitments, a movie,  and hearing Andrew Strong's voice, I bought all two CD's available in the U.S.  With this purchase of his third CD I was extremely pleased.  Most of the songs were NOT on his other two CD's and for that I am grateful.  I love his voice.  I wish he would perform in the US.  
 Terrible.  A waste of money.  This comedian just yells everything.  Very similar to Sam Kinnison.  If you liked Sam, you'll like Lewis.  I prefer humor that requires a better sense of humor to think up.  Just screaming 100% of the time isn't my idea of a funny act 
 Bollywood is known for it's cheesy plots and long films that with story lines that can be summarized in about 2.5 minutes.  But usually they offer a lot of fun, some good music, and some amusing moments.  Often they even take cheap shots at the heart strings.  That is why I keep coming back to Bollywood.  But this movie was pure drivel that I wouldn't wish on anyone with half of a brain. The movie's largest fault is it's star, Samir Khan.  Once again, he rolls through a role flexing his abs, being fawned over by giggling females (why?), and being doe-eyed and lovey,caring, sensitive guy, none of which is convincing at all.  Especially in light of his arrest and imprisonment for being a Bollywood bad boy (if you don't know about his conviction, do an on-line search).  I hope that doing time humbles this arrogant sot to be a little more gracious. Then the movie is just offensive by insulting the intelligence of the viewer.  For instance, Khan's character, when all seems lost in his relationship with Rai's character, returns to "Italy" where he was raised.  There are several shots of the lovely Italian city (unnamed) where he lives with his mum, but many people would recognize BUDAPEST, HUNGARY! (Why wasn't the movie set in Hungary if they wanted to film there?)  Hungarian language is spoken and written all over the film and Khan fakes the is speaking the local language by making annoying buzzing and chirping sounds that sound more like a coffee pot on the fritz than either Italian or Magyar. Oh, the movie also features childish, scatological humor with Rai and a bevy of females giggling when they hear Khan's character pass gas when he thinks he's alone.  Is this third grade? Rai is elegant as always in her part and has one good dance sequence, but I'm not convinced that she was into this film.  She seems a bit bored throughout. And her gorgeous glances can't save this film from all it's faults. This movie was terrible!  Truly terrible 
 This is nothing but a huge dissapointment. There's almost nothing on this video about baseball. If there was a rating lower than zero stars, I would give it that rating. 
 I found it difficult to even complete the first chapter because of the verbose style of writing.  There are so many euphasims, comparions, tangents, etc. that the message is somehow overshadowed and it makes it  difficult to recall the main point the author was trying to make.  Not sure who the author's target audience was, but reading like this was worse than any graduate level text or professional journal that I have ever read. 
 very shallow interpretation even for beginners, in addition accompanied by helplessly boring photographs. avoid 
 The title speaks for itself.  I don't know how or why I was drawn to this magazine when I was 14. This magazine should be called J-4tweens. Ah. The title is very annoying. Like Twist, I only get this magazine when I'm really really desperate for something to read. I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion. All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist. Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake 
 I bought this book to use in a class, but I only read four pages before giving up because it was just too much to read. Get a magnifying glass people. This book is written in fine print. You'd think they would publish it in a font that would comfortable to read. For that reason alone I returned it in favor of another 
 Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of "local legends" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 I was thinking negative thoughts waiting for the book to advise me on positive thoughts. 
 The book offers very general points already covered by the hundreds of sales books written before.  Did not like the constant reference to the author's website for additional details/information.  I was looking for a little sales motivation, not being "sold" to.. 
 not funny,dumb plot,jim is not funny in this film, this is prolly the worst jim c. movie ever mad 
 This book is a decent story that reads fairly well, but the four most important words I can include in this review are "graphically depicted zebra sex."  Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is in the book 
 I listen to lots of classical music and wanted some quality earphones for my new IPod.  In the $200 range the Shure E4 gets top reviews.  Mine were a big disappointment.  I thought my first pair was defective, and Shure generously exchanged them.  The replacement pair was just a bad.  The E4 series has very poor base and very harsh higher frequencies.  Overall, these $200 earphones are much worse than the original $25 earphones that come with the IPod.   Much worse.  The sound produced by the E4 is marginally better than a cell phone.  If you're not serious about music, and want something fancy to plug your ears with, the Shure earphones will do the job.  
 Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though 
 When you decide to adapt a classic film you should take warning several aspects: Has the story aged? How has the suspense's concept altered for the new audiences?   We know about the professed sympathy of Cimino for Rourke. We saw him in The year of the Dragon. And somehow Mickey doesn't look credible as the distorted mind criminal. He is too rational and cold to represent that hard character. The illumination is another serious problem. The whole drama looks extremely theatrical: Anthony Hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and Mimi Rogers is inexpressive. Elias Koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that's why the insipid dialogue. Maybe David Morse shows certain wild tendency. There is a rigidity in the dialogue. Obviously you assist to the common places: the internal disagreements in the policy procedure. Lindsay Cruise is assertive in this role. But the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific. It looks too artificial and the viewer' adrenaline simply is not emanated. The sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse. The music didn't help to maintain the suspense. It is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties. Something similar happened with Cape fear `s remake. The question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies. Bogart looked extremely old for the role and Rourke looked too elegant to be a convincing ex con.  Good entertainment for teenagers in a pop corn rainy weekend.          
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as "I Might Be Wrong," "Pact," and "Hunting Bears" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead.  
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 i bought this rice cooker last year it worked only for few months.the nonstick coating was gone within 4 to five months only.again i took out my old panasonic rice coker to use  b'coz that does not stick the rice as this one don't waste your money buying this 
 This book illustrates the effects of long-term drug and alcohol abuse far better than any lecture a parent can give.  Mr. Ellis can't anymore distinguish between reality and the replays in his imagination.  It's hard to feel compassion or even interest for someone who has lots of money and fame and feels so, so sorry for himself 
 Entombed in this 420 page novel is a decent hard sf short story about Earth's first contact with robotic aliens.  Unfortunately, Benford takes on the ambitious task of marrying his traditional space alien story with a literary story about human relationships and the meaning of life, a worthy project he is not equipped to bring to a successful conclusion.  So, the interesting alien encounter plot is buried under hundreds of pages of tedious domestic drama (the main character, a British-born astronaut, has a menage a trois marriage, and one of the women is terminally ill) and political infighting (the astronaut is a Bob Dylan- and John Lennon-loving rebel who refuses to play the dishonest games of the warmongering bureaucrats and religious fanatics in the U.S. government.)  Benford gets an "A" for effort as he unleashes literary allusions, unconventional prose  techniques, and scads of metaphors and similies, and piles on chapter after chapter about the sex lives, religious beliefs, cocktail parties, drug use, day trips to the beach and vacations of the astronaut and his circle, but the characters are uninteresting and the only parts of the book that really work are those two or three dozen pages in which a character is in the cockpit of a space ship or Lunar craft.  Too bad 
 The author has developed an interesting world: there are parallel realms populated by magic and non-magic beings (ranging from plain humans to dragons), an interesting magic system (with levels, but also specialized castes), a decent-sized cast. Unfortunately the trilogy suffers from lots of problems that are impossible to ignore when stumbling over them many times in hundreds of pages. Note that this review may contain spoilers.  First there's the rampant overuse of 'taboo' subjects like S&M, rape, incest and pedophilia - it's not innovative, daring or edgy, just unrealistically widespread and pointless. Consider that in the first half of the trilogy, two of the three leading men are continuously being 'punished' by excruciating pain from rings attached to their sexual organs, the female protagonist lives in a children's mental hospital visited by 'uncles' who rape and kill the occupants (without the families ever noticing), the evil witch has intercourse with children - including her own son, another main female character was produced when her mother was violated (later killed), there's some father-daughter incest in the family of the female protagonist, and it just goes on and on and on. The second half of the trilogy is a bit more restrained in this regard, but still treats us to some real gems in this department.  The trilogy also suffers from a typical fantasy problem: excessively powerful characters. This problem is however enhanced by the most asymmetric distribution of power between good and evil I've ever seen.  The magic system consists of 13 different power levels, symbolized by colored jewels - the darker the color, the more powerful (black being the most powerful). A black-jeweled individual is powerful enough to destroy a good part of a city and kill/disable hundreds or thousands of weaker individuals in one outburst of power. Somebody is considered to have basically no chance when fighting a person with a darker jewel. Given this, consider the power distribution in the book: on the evil side, there are two red-jeweled witches (level 10) and for the rest the obligatory cannon fodder. On the good side, we have the only two black-jeweled men (Saetan and Daemon, level 13) and the only black-jeweled woman in the world, two level 12 men (also the only ones in the world), one level 11 woman, a dragon with undefined tremendous power (who never uses it) and the main female protagonist - Jaenelle. Jaenelle has, as a child, the power equivalent to dozens of regular black-jeweled persons. When she grows up, she goes to a previously unknown level that is darker than black; according to Daemon her power is the equivalent of *thousands* of black-jeweled men, making her probably more powerful than the rest of the world put together. Just to top it off, at the end of the book she gets yet another special power level created, just for her, though we are not told what that level actually means.  By the second half of the trilogy, we have all this effectively infinite power (plus the cannon fodder that on the good side is actually roughly the strength as the evil witches) gathered in one place, yet somehow unable to eradicate the wimpy evil. Hazard a guess as to what damage all the good power causes in the first 95% of the book... it makes the two evil witches ugly. Yep, that's it. The ridiculousness of this situation is emphasized by the fact that Saetan has a red-jeweled *butler* - in other words, the guy who opens the door and brings the coffee on the good side is as strong as the strongest evil character.  Third are the unrealistic characters: everyone is incredibly handsome, infinitely rich if they need money (we are told Daemon pays a 2 mln gold coin bribe and could do it again if necessary and he even owns a secret private island somewhere - all of that achieved with secret investments while being a pleasure slave?!), extremely powerful (see above), telepathic, has the ability to transport him-/herself over vast distances using 'the webs' or gates and several of the characters have the ability to resist and produce poison as well as interpret the future or heal dangerous injuries. In fact the super-rich Daemon is so drop-dead gorgeous and hot that he can satisfy women sexually - yet leave them longing for more for days afterward - just by looking at them.   The difference between good and evil is that the good ones are very nice, caring, sentimental and wimpy, while the evil ones are stupidly backstabbing evil and love S&M.  For example on the good side we have Saetan, black-jeweled, natural Black Widow, 50000 years old High Lord of Hell and High Priest of the Hourglass (sounds tough and impressive, right?) who we see giving a foot massage to some other guy, and whining about wanting to borrow a romance novel. All guys on the good side are douchebags and almost all women annoying spoilt brats.  On the evil side the two witches continue to come up with all kinds of small, stupid plans to get Jaenelle in their power. A plan fails? No matter, kill the one responsible and go to the next stupid plan lined up. Not unlike Pinky and The Brain - I was waiting for "Gee, what do you want do to tonight?" "Same thing we do every night, try to take over the world.". In the end they *almost* get the obvious idea (war), but that doesn't quite work out because they get distracted by a pathetic kidnapping scheme that's doomed to fail. Frustratingly stupid really. The only thing that's more stupid is that the infinitely powerful Jaenelle spends most of her time in the book being completely exhausted and emaciated due to dealing with side-effects of these plans or her own incompetence - however stupid and transparent the plan, Jaenelle is going to almost-but-not-quite die or lose her powers fighting it.   Fourth problem is that the language chosen by the author makes suspense of disbelief difficult. There's repetition (humans snarling, 'males' versus 'females', fruitless attempts of the super-powerful to get drunk (they usually can't because they're so damn powerful), continuous complaints about how exasperating this or that is), words that simply don't fit in a fantasy setting (powerful wizards/warlords over and over again referred to as "boyos", shopping sprees), unrealistic amenities (running hot and cold water, the presence of a "Dr." who is in charge of the mental hospital - while medicine is in all other cases done by Healers with no academic title), Bond-like gadgets (manufactured by the super-powerful Jaenelle in the second half of the book).  Last but not least, the world is not properly explained. In time, you do get an idea of how it's organized, but as the purpose of the book is not to let you puzzle on this, it should be explained beforehand, or in an appendix or whatever. The scale of the world is also not clear: characters effectively jump between places (because they're so powerful and can travel "the webs" - we have no idea at what speed this is or how long it takes in most cases) and between parallel realms - they don't ever walk or use a horse for more than two miles or so. Jaenelle knows just about everyone in the book and just about everyone knows who she is and adores her on the first meeting (unless they're evil). The result is that the Black Jewels universe feels very small and claustrofobic.  Two stars for the idea, half a star for the writing style. Rounded down because I think it's very overrated at this point 
 I know this was one of Jet Li's earlier films based on the clothing, music, and hairstyles of the characters in the movie, and Jet Li looked much younger. Anyway I was quite disappointed, I am glad Jet's movies have gotten better because this one was........my mouth hung open through most of it. Asians complain about being stereotyped in other people's movies, but there were stereotypes about everyone in this movie and I know I am just rambling on but,,,,,my goodnes........It was pretty bad. I gave it just one extra start just because it was Jet!! 
 the mic's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver mp3-player and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time (it's really loud). before you buy it check out some sample-recordings on the internet if you are interested in high quality

 I can validate the truth of the review "A book of no value" from knowing Judith Coney as she struggled to "study" Sahaja Yoga. This book was written to gain academic kudos rather than as an accurate representation of Sahaja Yoga, and because of this Ms Coney chose to leave out whatever positive heartfelt experiences she did have, as these would have invalidated her "objectivity" as a "sociologist".   Its also true that the majority of the people who would speak to Ms Coney on Sahaja Yoga were a small minority of x practicioners with a negative ax to grind, as people with a positive view could sense Ms Coney's determination to put forward a view that would please the academics.  Read Meta Modern Era if you want a accurate view of what is a truly amazing and profound technique for achieving divine states of consciousness 
 I'm using Linksys Wireless-G routers with SRX400 with no problems whatsoever, but this particular notebook adapter caused nothing but problems. I could not boot any laptop with it inserted in the adapter slot. If I left it in the adapter slot and booted, the laptop froze. I had no problems inserting and using once the laptop was already started, but who wants to pull out an adapter every time you shutdown? Linksys wasn't much help getting it fixed and at the time I wasn't going to wait for new drivers to come out so I ditched it for the wireless-g USB adapter and have had no problems since 
 Being an MP3 and playlist-obsessive person, I gave this book a perusal at the bookstore.  There wasn't a whole lot of thought put into many of these lists.  Just because a batch of songs has the word "martini" in the title, for example, doesn't make them hold together as a playlist.  When you're thinking about making a playlist for the open road, the songs you pick don't need to necessarily describe the road, but should make you feel alive and free.  One of the downsides to itunes is that anyone can drag and drop songs and think they've made a worthy playlist.  Real playlist making takes eons of internal debate (like John Cusack's character in "High Fidelity").  There is an art to making mixes that this book generally misses out on 
 I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera. 
 As a big fan of Ralph, I was looking forward to The End of the Affair.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but this movie is dreadful.  Ralph is a brilliant actor, but not even his flawless acting can't compensate for the nonsensical plot and the horrific casting of Julianne Moore.  What happened to Moore?  It is NOT hard to learn a British accent.  From the sounds of it, Moore didn't even try.  She sounds so American she fails to convince anyone she has an ounce of English in her.  And if that weren't bad enough, the plot is as unconvincing as Moore's accent.  She's an adulteress, but miraculously heals a young boy's facial disfigurement and brings Ralph back from the dead. Even the priest admires her--adultery and all! Her husband does not know the meaning of jealously and lets Ralph live in the house even though he knows of the affair.  Still amidst the unbelievable, the plot is so predicatable.  She coughs a few times here and there.  So we know (before anyone in the movie figures it out) that she's dying.  We also know why she "ends" the affair long before its "revealed" to Ralph. And by the way, what was with all the nudity?  Totally unnecessary and vulgar 
 Ehhh... I'm just not real impressed with this one.  First of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice, but also kinda vague.  It's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes, and if you're interested in astrology at all, you know them already.  Don't get me wrong - it's not *bad.*  There's no wrong information, it's passably accurate (for astrology.)  I can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps, and even for the rest of us, it's occasionally got some new info (this book, for instance, is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the Aries norm.)  It's just not enough to get excited over, and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done.  Secondly, and more irritatingly, the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot.  I think it would have been easier to deal with if they'd ALL just been laughably wrong, but no - after slogging through, say, 4 or 5 descriptions that could have been describing total strangers (because they certainly weren't describing me and my people), I'd hit upon something like "Confidential Projects," which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother.  What do you do with a book like that?  (Also?  As has been noted by other reviewers, the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing.  If I were to take it seriously, I'd be huddled in the corner now, wide-eyed, whimpering "nobody loves me and I have no real friends!"  Sheesh.)  It leads me to one of two conclusions: 1) it really is scattershot - they're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks; or, 2) they're actually on to something, but haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Which wouldn't be too bad, except that it's being published as a finished product, you know?  Final recommendation: pass.  If you're reading for entertainment, there are more entertaining astrology books out there; if you're a serious student, there are more thorough and accurate books.  If you've got money to burn and don't mind weeding through the stuff that's superfluous and the stuff that's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes, it might make a decent addition to round out a library.  Just please don't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology 
 This is one of those books that is great to flip through in a bookstore or friend's house but never buy.  And I am quite a fan of Shabby Chic and Rachel Ashwell.  So if you don't even like her stuff, nothing in this book will sustain your interest.  There is not much copy to read, her "tips" are very generic or just off-the-mark (she says it's ok to buy termite-ridden antiques because "a simple commercially available spray" gets rid of termites - somehow I don't see many women attempting this), and the book is mostly photos.  While pretty, the photos are sourced from the same few celebrity homes she knows, so one feels a bit shortchanged 
 Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer 
 In this book, Mr. Katz set out to show how these two "geeks" had nothing going for them, yet through determination and computer-know-how they were able to find a niche in the world that was all their own. This is not that kind of a story. Let me just remind people that these "two lost boys" did not "ride the Internet out of Idaho." They rode Jon Katz's wallet out of Idaho, used it to get some plane tickets to Chicago, an apartment, and, in Jesse's case, into college. Jesse's constant griping about authority and his social misfortunes is sickening.  I knew him in high school and with all of his knowledge he never figured out that not fitting in isn't always a social edict, sometimes it's a personal choice of simply conforming to acceptable and feasible guidelines. Growing up in a small town, dealing with self-induced seclusion, playing Quake in a darkened apartment, listening to MP3s, and using ICQ to send messages, does not merit any kind of praise from the readers of this book. If it were not for Mr. Katz and his sympathy towards Eric and Jesse, Eric would have still made something of himself (seeing as though he actually has skills outside of the world of computers; you know, social skills), while Jesse would probably still be living in a single bedroom apartment in Caldwell, making fake drivers licenses for underage kids, and riding his bicycle to a dead-end job at a second-rate computer store because his own license was revoked. Instead of showing us how the Internet can act as a catalyst to propel those with determination and desire into something bigger and better than what has been given, Mr. Katz shows us how pity, cash, and some journalistic influence can help people skip over the journey that makes a triumph worth struggling for.  
 In "Her Majesty's Spymaster," Stephen Budiansky attempts to show the truth behind the Walsingham myth, by pulling together countless quotes from letters, diaries, and marginalia. Unfortunately, the attempt is lost in the telling. Even though the picture he shapes for us is a much closer representation than Hollywood gives us, the method of his delivery has much to be desired.   In fact, the book is so loaded down with quotes and excerpts that it lacks any real tone or voice of its own. The end result is nothing more than a mish-mash of historical references and quips that are merely slung together in chronological order with no sense of purpose, and lacking any new insight or greater understanding of Walsingham's life or career.   If you're looking for an interesting, in-depth narration of Walsingham's expansive service, this isn't it. If you want to remember why you hated history class in middle school, look no further. 
 Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here. 
 First, I think Terry Pratchett is a masterful writer.  Second, cat fanciers are boring when enraptured by the small furry pests despite being masterful writers.  This is no Discworld, I did not find it entertaining enough to bother to read the whole thing.  Ansel Adams probably would bore you with photos of his kids.  Speilburg would probably bore you with his home movies.  
 Some nice examples of jewelry to make, but not as much detail as I expected 
 I just finished with this book after solving the six categories of tests and scoring myself. I then tallied my highest categories and looked up the careers recommended for a person of my talents. Believe it or not, at the graduate level ALL of the careers recommended were those of a scientist or science intensive. Yeah, imagine that. Not one non scientific career. Now guess what? I am a young physician-scientist and I DONT like my job at all. How wrong can the recommendations get! Been there, done that and know for sure that this isnt the field for me.  My genuine interest is finance and banking and while I got a well above average score in the business test, several questions seemed to rely on knowledge one would be expected to glean from an MBA or by working in the business world, and not any innate ability. Having never gone to B School or worked in a Business Industry, I felt short changed. Whats more, a test remarkably similar to this one had been administered at my school when I was in the tenth grade and I was told that I was most suited to a career in science.Ironically enough now I know that that is the one career I can say for sure isnt the one for me. Go figure 
 The classic easy-to-use and pantry-friendly Better Homes and Garden Cookbook is pretty much in every kitchen in America and chances are, it's already in yours too.  If so, then then there's nothing in this obnoxiously-colored cookbook for kids that you couldn't find in either the adult BH & H cookbook or a back issue of Family Circle.  With a few exceptions, (most notably the breakfast pizza and the Hula Stir Fry) it's all extremly standard fare.  The only thing that sets it apart is the crazy fonts and colors so obnoxious that I had to wait ten minutes between reading it and writing this review so I could see straight again.  I mean, are you really in need of another chicken nugget recipe?  Isn't there anything more interesting they could come up with?  And it isn't written to make the cooking any easier for kids--they might as well grab your adult copy and save their vision.  If you're looking for a kid's cookbook that's full of good projects that will appeal to your children, I recommend the Everything Kid's Cookbook which has a black on white format, crossword puzzles and word finds for the older kids, and easy to follow instructions along with five really terrific projects that the kids can whip up for play, like bubbles and play dough.  Mom and Me by Annabel Karmel is also a much, much better selection, with easy to follow illustrated directions.  This is a suped-up version of standard fare you'd be better off skipping 
 I'll keep this short. Who ever made this film had a good idea and turned  it into something that would've never happend. Tyrants don't think their  bad and question themselves in the mirror. Who ever played Hitler played  him like an american schoolboy mimicking him during the war. Stay away from  this film 
 BORING!!! Why are these girls all hacking out the same tunes with the same emotionless sound. 
 I was introduced to His Verbosity, Stephen R. Donaldson, in my mid teens. At the time I thought Donaldson was very Wise and Deep, and that his book was practically dripping with insights on the human condition. Now that so much time has passed me by, I decided I would read it again to see how well it would hold up. Read on; the whole dreary experiment is detailed below.   This book is about a successful writer, Thomas Covenant, who is stricken with the ancient horror of leprosy. The disease strips him of everything worth having, leaving him mentally, spiritually and physically maimed. After a severe traffic accident he is transported to a magical place known only as the Land, a Reality so essentially wholesome that his leprosy is cured simply by being there. But it is also a place whose peace is threatened by Lord Foul, ancient foe of Good and practitioner of Wickedness. This evil entity lays upon Thomas Covenant the charge of carrying a Message of Doom to the Lords of Revelstone, a Doom in which Covenant finds himself included thanks to the unguessable might of his white gold wedding ring! Can Thomas Covenant reach the Lords in time to stop this nightmarish vision from becoming reality!?  Man, it SOUNDS pretty good, don't you think? How could it all have gone so terribly, terribly wrong? First of all, Thomas Covenant is the most unrelentingly unpleasant person to ever appear in the fiction of a civilized people. I get that he's an anti-hero, but famous anti-heroes like Billy the Kid and Jesse James had personality, some trait or Independent Streak that people can admire on some level. Covenant has no redeeming qualities of any description. He rapes the first person to offer him aid. He never talks; ol' Tommy can only communicate by grating, snarling, glowering, and occasionally, when he's feeling lazy, by shouting. Covenant pities the fool who tries to connect in a physical way, too! "Don't touch me!!" he screams again and again, flinging acid in the faces of his staunchest allies. He keepeth Ingratitude and Surliness closer than a brother, and surely he shall dwell amongst the Jackasses forever, saith the critic.  Was Donaldson being paid by the syllable? At a guess, I'd say I must have read at least five or six hundred books over the course of my life, but I ran across quite a few obscure words here. I'm talking about words I have never read or heard used in ANY place OTHER THAN this book. It reads as though a Thesarus publisher was paying the author to test drive a gratis copy of their product, and Donaldson bought a ski lodge in Aspen outright with the proceeds. I do not object to being challenged by what I read, but here it's so overbearing as to reduce itself to an irritating parody.    With added perspective I realize the characters are about as engaging as an episode of Full House. One dimensional set pieces, carted to and fro and forced to utter the absurdest dialogue, they are never allowed to have an ambiguous thought or feeling of their own. This is the same reason I no longer enjoy 'Star Wars' in the same way I did as a child, the moral extremes no longer seem plausible. And so what you are left with are not characters but plot devices, wind-up soldiers who serve only to make the authors' point for him. Life is very short, and there are much, much better books out there to enjoy 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up

 I tend to be a little picky about which movies I watch, especially for those rare theaters visits, but to some degree for my rentals pick as well.  The factor I most often use to influence my decisions are the films' trailers.  Usually they are a decently reliable indicator of whether I will like a film, although once in a while it proves to be inaccurate (MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND among others).  Unfortunately, JET LI'S FEARLESS is another of those films that catches your attention with an impressive trailer, but turns out to have little else of interest or enjoyment beyond the clips used to advertise it.  The film does feature some impressive martial artistry and choreography, for which Jet Li has become the pre-eminent martial arts action star.  And though his acting ability and language proficiency are limited, he does have a good screen presence.  The weakness lies within the remainder of the film (which composes the majority of it).  It is competently and even skillfully filmed, but the pacing goes from slow to dreary at some points.  The writing is bland and sappy and preachy.  Though the film is based on a true story, there are still points which strain its credibility, most especially the fight between Li's character and the titanic American boxer.  In fact, the creative license they take with the scene crosses that line from creative embellishment to insulting the audience's intelligence.     The film-marketers may lure you in with "promises" of dazzling fight scenes (which is what happened in my case), but the bulk of the film is tedious sanctimony.  No umbrage towards those who market and promote this film; they did their job well, though it is little reason to celebrate.  Overall, this is not a terrible film, nor even a bad film.  But it is not a very satisfying movie, and that is ultimately what most influences the ratings (number of stars) that comes with a review.  This film claims to be Jet Li's final epic.  After watching this film, I say it's about time.  Though Jet Li is still great - maybe among the best - if you want to see an amazing martial arts action star who does action-filled (if not very cerebral) movies, Tony Jaa is the new champion. 
 depressing as each chapter starts with a final illness segment.  Without that it would have been a MUCH better and more enjoyable book.  It may have been cathartic and healing for Chris, but not so for me 
 Target regularly has these for under $4. I've seen them as high as $4.95 in boutique stores. But $20?! How can we trust -any- price on Amazon after this 
 Sorry, but I guess I'm not so much.  Bought this on recommendation of a friend.  As I live near Nashville, you can imagine how popular Amy is.  But I found her voice no better than average, a little on the thin side, and her renditions of these did not redeem it.  Be forewarned:  you've got to be a fan to really like this 
 The author attempts to overwhelm the reader with endless details from anthropology, history, sociology, psychology, political theory, etc. and endless analysis of factors to discuss the relation of gender and war--all in the service of the white male patriarchal academic establishment.    Meanwhile, under "matriarchies," he has two entries:  "lack of evidence...[and] rhesus monkeys."  He conveniently assumes that matriarchies would have been the mirror image of patriarchies, i.e., amazonian matriarchies, which allows him to exclude discussion of actual matriarchies--at least one of which still persists in the United States today--the Iroquois.  The reader never learns that indeed there were such matriarchies as the Iroquois, where the mothers of the tribe were empowered to make the decision about whether the males would conduct war.  See Doug George-Kanentioo, Iroquois Culture & Commentary (New Mexico:  Clear Light Publishers, 2000).  Nor does the reader learn that there are scholars such as Ifi Amadiume, a Professor at Dartmouth College, who has demonstrated the existence of African matriarchies in many works, especially African Matriarchal Foundations (London:  Karnak House, 1987).

 My first Stuart Woods book and I'm not likely to pick up another.  Not a likeable character to be found other than the domestic help.  I didn't care what happened to anyone.  
 I can't help but agree with most of the reviews on this page; this guide is nearly useless. The Prima (the leader in half-assing every guide they've ever gotten their hands on) guide "walks" us through a game where chest locations are off and inaccurate, enemies don't   appear in the right spots, the data on the Fiend Challenges is basically: "kill the guys that um... you know, attack... uh yeah." There's misspellings in a few cases and grammatical errors. Also keep in mind: their boss strategies aren't crucial to your survival, I bearly used 'em. The only slightly useful piece of this guide is the Golden Scarabs. One note on that, once you find the 50th GO BACK AND TURN THEM IN. I made the mistake of not trudging back to town due to being anxious about beating the game. In summery: don't buy this unless you really need feel you need a very small amount of visual support. You're better off on your own 
 It's almost always sad and is certainly always instructive to see living myths die. The Woodward of "All the President's Men" was just such a living myth. Like all myths, the Woodward myth does serve a purpose. In this case, the purpose is highlighting our societal belief that the truth is worth fighting for, that uncovering the truth can make a difference, and that a couple of young guys in cheap suits with the right ideas and a little extra chutzpah can even take on the President of the United States...and win. Of course that Woodward never truly existed and the real Woodward has always had to live under the shadow of the myth that bears his name. Honestly, I don't envy...even if he is proverbially crying all of the way to the bank.  What's scary with a living myth, though, is when people confuse the real person and the myth and assume that the carnal hero actually has the powers that the myth suggests. I recall having a conversation with a good friend not long after Woodward published "Bush at War". Although this friend is among the most innately intelligent people I know, is a strong liberal, and was initially opposed to the war in Iraq, she was still caught in the sway of the Woodward myth and reading "Bush at War" had convinced her that the Bush administration was both cautious and thoughtful in its lead up to the war. When I asked her how she could so easily change her mind, her response was that, "This is Bob Woodward...not some right-wing hack." Although I think it's somewhat unfair to refer to Woodward as either right wing or as a hack. I'm afraid that he is much closer to these two appellations than he is to the myth that has been created around him.  The sooner people realize this, the better it will be for all of us. The real Bob Woodward has been veiled for too long by his mythic aura. It's about time that this veil is lifted for all of us to see the real Woodward. I think the Bob Woodwards of the world, real and mythic, are quite instructive. As time passes, I hope the fictional Woodward can continue to inspire young reporters to tilt at windmills...and I hope the real Bob Woodward story helps us realize that both valor and value are fleeting and that you stop being a champion once you've joined the mill 
 This book is doctrinally-slanted in favor of Arminianism.    One example: The author's entry for Acts 13:48 goes out of it's way to specifically warn you against the "Calvinist" interpretation of this verse.  The book suggests that Acts 13:48 should be properly translated: "As many as *set themselves* unto eternal life were saved".  There is nothing in the Greek that would call for such an interpretation, and none of the mainstream bible translations have such a wording.  The author implies that all mainstream bible translations (NASB,KJV,NIV,NKJV,ESV,etc.) of this verse are wrong, and that he is right.    Another example of the author's eisegesis is in his translation of Ephesians 1:4 for the words "Chosen in Him".  For this verse he quotes Cremer as saying "This verse cannot be taken to imply a division of mankind into two classes according to a divine plan before history began".     I would highly suggest looking into alternative resources which do not exhibit a traditional bias, and where the author is committed to truth in translating.  This author is not trustworthy 
 "A startling piece of detective work," says the Amazon book description, "that combines history, literary criticism, esoterica and archaeology, Genesis of the Grail Kings is the ultimate story of earthly kingship from its Mesopotamian foundation."    Well, yeah, sort of.   I have been expanding my mind with crackpot literature for many years and I must say that this is as fine an example of such bilge as I have ever seen. It starts off with a bang, being forwarded by "HRH [no less!] Prince Nicholas de Vere KGC, KCD / Princeps Draconis, Sovereign Grand Master / and Magister Templi of Sarkany Bend / The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order".  Well, I'm impressed.  Sure I am.  Although I can only wonder why HRH has not also taken on the duties of Master of the Buckhounds, Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor, both acting and elect.    Gardner casts a wide net.  He offers aliens from outer space who may or may not have originated on a Kuiper Belt object with an orbital period of 360 (or perhaps 3600) years and who may have interfered with human evolution in some not quite specified way about 6,000 years ago to create--ta-dah!--Adam and Eve.  These aliens, of course, were the immortal gods of the earliest Mesopotamians who have ... well ... died out, leaving behind a line of alien/divinely appointed kings to reign over nothing much down to this very day.  I'm not making this up, you know!  Gardener also offers a revised history of the text of the Bible which, among other things, proves pretty conclusively that God did not dictate it to King James after all.    Gardener is also very big on offering the TRUTH.  Since the TRUTH is radically inconsistent with the writings of a couple of millenniums of historians and four centuries of post-Renaissance scholarship, Gardener politely corrects them all.    And he throws in other goodies, too.  Consider this passage from page 204 of the paperback edition: "Another feature of the white powder [the Philosopher's Stone] is that even its 56 per cent substance (that is the sample excluding the 44 per cent light content) can be made to disappear completely from sight, moving itself into another dimension. At that stage of experimentation (which, incidentally, can be wholly reversed) not only does the invisible substance weigh less than nothing but the pan in which it was  sitting also registers less than its zero point starting weight.  This particular aspect of the fire stone's has some stunning consequences, as will be discovered when the latter stages of our investigation move into the anti-gravitational sciences of  ancient Egypt."  Now, THAT's what I call top of the line woo-woo!  (An opinion which, incidentally, cannot be reversed at all.)  As book-length ravings go, this one is actually rather entertaining.  It contains a considerable amount of information, both accurate and new.    The accurate information includes details about the development of the currently accepted text of the Bible and the contents of a substantial number of cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  A hundred and fifty years ago, when this was first published by hard-headed, sharp-eyed scholars, mostly of the German persuasion who were known as the higher critics, it was hot news.    Gardener's new gems of information, the experiments disproving the universal attraction of gravity, the long, long genealogies largely supported by moonstruck etymology, the literal truth of the venerable ages of the Biblical patriarchs and the even longer-lived antediluvian kings of Sumer, the oddly incompetent god-aliens from space, the endless riffs about the nature of myths and historical research, they are all woo-woo.  Just plain, sweet woo-woo masquerading as something useful 
 Very hard to put together, drawers came broken both times- cute though- not at all sturd 
 Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!  
 You know that friend you have that no one likes? The one you hang around with because you feel sorry for them, and you want them to stay away from you but you don't have the heart to tell them? Well, imagine if you did tell them to stay away from you. And imagine if they didn't listen. That is the perfect premise for the perfect black comedy. How could anybody screw this up? There are two ways. First, cast the likable and funny Jim Carrey in the role of a dark character. Second, downplay the "black" aspect and emphasize the "comedy" aspect. A black comedy should play as a horror movie, and the comedy will naturally develop from there. Instead, this movie grossly plays on the comedy aspect, adding cheap jokes by the gallon. Now, I don't mind cheap jokes at all. One of my favorite movies of all times is Tommy Boy. However, this movie doesn't even succeed in that department. My advice: Don't see it if you're a fan of either black or slapstick comedies. This movie insults both of them 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 I'm a business planning consultant and a client just gave me a copy of this book. Way too basic, not enough help on the most important part of any business plan: the financials. If you want to get funded, look for a better book 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 This might be the first book that I have ever read that I absolutely hate. Usually I can find something good or interesting about a book but not this one. In fact the only reason I finished reading it was because I was really hoping for something terrible to happen to this infuriating family. Oh well. Do not waste one precious moment of your life reading this crap, you will only end up depressed and angry. Well at least that was my reaction to it. 
 While containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  First, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  That's right: no introduction, no methodology.  There is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (Amusingly, I went to show my neighbor one of the plans that I liked.  He said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. And would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)     Secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  In the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.   The lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.   In short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online.   
 I happen to be one of the unfortunate souls who happened across this book and read it (Thank God for research purposes only.)  Poorly written and I believe it was self published.  No publisher worth his salt would print this crap.  DR. Milligan has a PHD?  From where, I assume the mail or a cracker jack box.  The only interesting part of this book was the Willy Lynch Letter, i.e., how black women raise their daughters to be independant, while spoiling their sons.  Outside of that, this book was filled with unsubstantiated psycho dribble drabble.  As a black man who has dated outside his race I would like to express that it had nothing to do with slavery or some longing to be with the beautifal white woman who is the standard for beauty, please....  I dated different races of women because of exposure to these women in a social setting and was attracted because of commonalities.  Black men like myself actually long to be with a black woman, life is a lot easier that way and besides, I along with most black men find our own women more physically attractive.  But what we don't find attractive is the argumentative behavior and funky attitude of young black women out there.  In short, black women need to deal with their own insecurities when it comes to white women.  The only one that puts white women on a pedistal is black women.  For example, you expose your hair to harsh chemicals to straighten your hair so it flows like a white womans hair.  Yes, I know it is more manageable that way, but so is a short crop cut or twist that you can WASH more frequently (i.e.,funky hair)!!  I gave this book one star because I was forced to give it at least one star in order for the review to post.  If I could give it a negative 5 stars I would 
 I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business 
 This movie was so dumb and slow.  Very bad picture quality and it is also fullscreen.  It also has a storyline that we all have seen like a hundred times. I only gave it 1 star because I am a fan of Bradley Stryker.  He should really consider some real movies instead of the B- movies for DeCoteau. You should see this movie just for the scenes with him.  P.S. he is also in the first Brotherhood movie too, in case you didn't know 
 This book has an attractive cover.  It has a mildly interesting introduction.  But that's it.  The balance of the book reads as if the author, with oh, perhaps five days to produce this work rounded up a bunch of fans, let them babble about what Bruce's music has meant to them, asked someone to transcribe the narratives, added a few uninsightful comments, and called it a book.  How sad.  How lazy.  The book adds virtually nothing to the studies of this legendary artist.  I bemoan the Bruce fans who received this book as a holiday gift from well-intentioned relatives.  I weep for the trees that were sacrificed to produce it.  And the real tragedy -- and irony -- is that apiring artists (as Bruce once was) find it nearly impossible to attract notice in significant measure because publishers would rather bank on authors such as Coles who have outstanding academic credentials and a publishing "track record," even if the egotistical trash they now produce wouldn't pass muster in any decent college English class.  If you already own this book, I suggest sending it back to Coles, annotated with a big red "F -- try again."   And if you don't already own it, take the money you considered using to buy this book and give it to a local food bank.  And if you're Robert Coles, you ought to be ashamed of yourself 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 Results makes a solid case for building blocks that a good Business 101 textbook would tell you make up a company's likelihood for success, but Results misses the mark on identifying or leveraging company personalities.     The term `company personality' is misused.  Instead of a company 'personality', the authors appear to be more accurately describing the maturity or efficacy of a company ~ which is a VERY different realm.  Said another way, the survey tool (and the book) do not describe a company's personality, they describe a company's level of dysfunction.   Results illustrates a preferred end of the efficacy spectrum labeled Healthy in which companies are said to have mature capacities for what we know are best practices for decisions, org charts, metrics, and performance infrastructure.   On the Unhealthy end are companies that have not developed similar capacities.   Results would then have us believe that all companies should aspire to become the same personality.  Herein lies the misnomer of the term `personality'.  The Healthy-Unhealthy spectrum of dysfunction offers a simplistic explanation of what makes a company 'work', but it is only two-dimensional.   A company's personality is THREE dimensional.   A company's personality is also founded on its core values, core beliefs, signal behaviors, its attitudes, and its vision.     If you are looking to leverage success through understanding your company's personality, read Companies are People, Too (Fekete, 2003) instead.  This book (and tool set) offer a well rounded approach to understanding company personalities and provides a way for all company personalities to have their place - and still be successful!   Intuitively, it makes more sense to assert that all company personalities are necessary to create a diverse and creative market.   For leaders within a company, it is imperative to identify (and identify with!) the unique and salient strengths of their company's personality.    Only armed with this information can a company distinguish itself from its competitors.     We can initiate change in business practices, but we can not inherently change a company personality - nor should we try!    The idea of changing the personality of a company would be like trying to beat gravity!   Results does offer sound, basic business lessons regarding infrastructure necessary for business success, but it does not fulfill on the promise of understanding and leveraging a company's personality to get there.

 It's pretty clear that the other reviewers of this book share the authors' fascination with type as a design element rather than as a means of communication.   If it were only a matter of taste, however, I'd be able to shrug it off. In fact, the authors display in the design of the text of this book their indifference -- or hostility -- to what most typographers regard as good type design for readability.  The Introduction, and the intros to each section, are set in what appears to be about 14/28 on a 7-inch measure -- far too long for comfortable reading, even with that much leading.  Worse, given such a generous measure, the text is still spaced abominably -- e.g., page 10, where a hyphen break leaves two letters from "typehouses" at the beginning of a line. Even the spacing in the narrow columns that accompany the illustrations in each section is atrocious; for people who are so concerned with the way type looks, they seem totally unconscious of the way that spacing affects color.   In many places, it's clear that the text was padded (with circumlocutions) to fit the space allotted to it on a page, and in others it appears that the spacing was adjusted to fill out the page. I won't even mention the typos...  Unfortunately for these authors, I had recently bought and read "The Complete Manual of Typography" by James Felici and "Thinking With Type" by Ellen Lupton, both of which are real books on typography that are eminently readable -- and practice what they preach. The Felici book, in particular, is a treasure.   Jan Tschichold, one of the leaders of Die Neue Typografie, ultimeately recanted and became one of the masters of classical typography. The authors of "Typology" should follow his example, and you should not buy this book if you're anything but a graphic designer who's looking for ways to use type that have nothing to do with actually reading it.  Because this is not a book to be read: it's a book to be looked at. If I'd had the opportunity to preview it in detail, I'd never have wasted the money; and the chances that I'll ever open it are slim to none, while the Felici book I mentioned earlier will be at my side whenever I set type 
 I purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my Ph.D. program professors who likes it better than de la Fuente's book. I agree that it's better than Fuente, but that's not saying much.  Simon and Blume wrote the book for people who not only already know mathematical economics, but who also think fluently in mathematics.  It's not for the beginning Ph.D. candidate in economics, but for the accomplished professor.  If you already know the material, I suspect that Simon and Blume will allow you to quickly reference any of the topics it covers.  If you're struggling to learn mathematical economics, however, don't try to use this book because it will reinforce any fears you might have about your ability to learn the subject in the first place 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 I was pleased to see this book at our local bookstore, but decided to check it out of our library first. Boy, am I glad I did! Many of the recipes include Worcestershire sauce. Students, especially those who are new to vegetarianism, may simply trust this book and may not know that Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies -- meat! Also, some canned mushroom soups have a beef base, which the author also neglects to mention. Just a note at the start -- or even just a concerted effort to specify *vegetarian*  Worcestershire sauce would have made all the difference. However, these flaws are so big as to keep me from purchasing this book -- for myself, for any friends, or for the collection of the library in which I work 
 Please do not be decieved into believing the lies that this books spews, it is neither a plausible nor in anyway acurate depiction of C S Lewis. He himself would be appauled at the implication that he agreed with the mormon philosphies. He was a true bornagain believer with a total desire to follow the one true Jesus Christ. Mormons believe that Jesus and Satan were brothers.So to assiociate the writings of a genius with the heretical lies of mormonism is totally rediculous and credulous. Keep your money and buy a book specifically written by the master himself. I personally love 'the great divorce' it will inspire your soul touch your sences and bring u face to face with the majesty and wonder of Jesus Christ our precious redeemer. The lord bless you all 
 I'll never forget how much I hated this book, a miserable read that stands as a yardstick to measure everything I hate in fiction. Because my first Atwood novel was the masterful "A Handmaid's Tale", I eagerly sought out a replay of that unforgettable book by reading her first really acclaimed work. Reading this thin volume felt like a lifetime's penance for every novel I have ever enjoyed. Some self-conscious, dated, impressionistic, terribly indulgent rumination on the injustice of life for the modern woman, by finishing it I learned a valuable lesson, namely what it is that I hate in a novel. Read "A Handmaid's Tale". 
 The album has eight songs available on previous records (same version, same mix). It is a steal of your money. Only 2 songs are new and are not so good. It has 2 remixes (Cuando pasara and Bajo la piel) that are Ok.  Please don't waste your money   
 Danis Tanovic's "No Man's Land" is either a drama with too much of a sense of humor or a satire with not enough wit.  At any rate, this is a film with a serious identity problem.  A group of Bosnian soldiers become lost in the middle of a dense fog.  Unknowingly for them, they have ventured too close to enemy Serbian soldiers and are fired upon.  Ciki (Branko Djuric) survives the massacre makes his way to a nearby trench for safety.  Shortly after, Ciki soon finds himself trapped in the trench with Nino (Rene Bitorajac), a Serbian solider sent to inspect the area.  A deadly standoff ensues.  The situation then worsens when another Bosnian survivor in the trench finds himself in the middle of a dire predicament.       "No Man's Land" showcases some fine performances and puts forth a dilemma that is ripe for serious drama or biting satire.  The problem is that the film cannot decide which road to take.  At the outset, "No Man's Land" plays as a straight drama as the trench standoff gives Ciki and Nino some wonderful character moments.  However, when the deadly situation involving the second Bosnian solider arises, the reaction by the parties outside of the trench hints that the film is about to transform into a satire along the lines of "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964) or "M*A*S*H*" (1970).  Alas, this is not to be.  What we get instead are a couple of weak semi-comedic moments showing people expressing confusion over the situation at hand.  "No Man's Land" then shifts back toward being a drama once more when the bad feelings between Ciki and Nino escalate and eventually lead to deadly violence.  Needless to say, this schizophrenic approach to the material is nothing short of disorienting.  When "No Man's Land" finally ends, one is left with the feeling that it has squandered an opportunity to be something much more than it turned out to be.  Ultimately, this is a prime example of a production that stumbled because it was unable to define its intentions clearly. 
 The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!   I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.  DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!! 
 Bought this to replace a cheap Rivan can opener that had a broken lid-retaining magnet. Biggest mistake. It routinely drops cans - even light ones like soup and mushrooms. Difficult to attach the can to it - and even harder to clean. Aviod this model at all costs 
 If you, like me, have recently discovered this amazing writer recently you will be tempted to read his final words laid out in this book.  I however was a little disappointed.  The writing does not flow effortlessly.  He refers to a lot of names (politicians, artists, and writers, etc.) and places, but I'm afraid the majority of these references will only make sense to a European history buff.  In fact, much of the book will only hold the interest of a history student.  I had hoped the book would document HIS world of yesterday thoroughly--his motivations for writing particular books etc.--instead it goes into details about Europe far too much.  An OK read, but if you want to skip this one you won't be missing much.  Maybe his best work was far too good and this mediocre, long-winded good-bye pales against it 
 I had the same experience with this as I did with one of Rettenmund's other books (Blind Items).  Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4.  Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs.  If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you.  Personally it drove me crazy 
 The book was a bit of a disappointment and didn't live up to its lofty title.  The advice was, well...dull.  Trust me, the girl trying to live up to this book will be far from hip 
 I bought these for my dad for Christmas and they did not fit his head, they didn't even fit mine and I have an average size head. Another thing, they did not look cool at all, they were ridiculous looking, nothing like the Photoshopped pictures 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 This cookbook uses too many hard-to-find ingredients that you have to drive all over to find.  I sent the book back to Amazon to get a refund. 
 i feel that this program uses vocabulary that should not be introduced to children as primary words when beginning a foreign language. it talks of ghosts, witches and other "scarey" things. i just don't feel that  those words are constructive, but that other positive more essential topics  could have been chosen to sing and learn about 
 Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one 
 To qualify as an alternate history, there must be a critical point which results in a completely different future.  The problem that I had with this book is that the point chosen to diverge from actual historical events is so inconsequential that, other than a few battles which only a historian would be acquainted with, the reader is hard pressed to know or care about the alternate outcome.  In addition, this book lacks the scope or vision which one usually expects from this type of work.  It reads like a college  history book peopled with a few characterizations of the people of  the time.  From a historical perspective, the only really interesting character is a minor player compared to the other historical personalities which are mentioned.  Finally, this work appears to be only the first of several, designed to drag the reader through a tedious serialization which only  a scholar, intimate with the minute details of Native American history could appreciate 
 Not only was this book offensive (see earlier reviews) but it is full of bad advice. For example, it actually tells women to never bring their kids to word! 
 Battlefield Earth is an adaptation of the book by L. Ron Hubbard.   While the book was a rather interesting story about humans, led by Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, taking back Earth from the Psychlos, the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences, with silly camera angles and awful editing. The Psychlos already have human workers before capturing Jonnie. This change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy. The film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book, but leaves most of it out, including the entire last half.   Considering this was a dream project for John Travolta, it's strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie, especially such a silly one. While the book was not without flaws, it was actually pretty good, but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made. The director, writers and editors all did a bad job. It does have some entertainment value though, which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating. 
 i am disappointed with silver ravenwolf for many reasons (the "teen witch kit" to name a big one). this is one of three books in a series. if you are a very beginner and just learning the general ideas of witchcraft, this book is okay but i would not take it too seriously. there is not enough attention payed to important matters about the spirituality of witchcraft/wicca/paganism and far too much payed to making silly powders to win the lottery. come on now, if these "luck" powders really worked how come we are buying our books used and for the sale prices on amazon:) magick is serious and you need to have a firm foundation and know the basic moral principles before practicing. that is not what you get from this book at all. i bought mine because of the cover art and because i desperately wanted to give silver ravenwolf a chance. it is nothing against her as a person, she is nice for i have met her. i just think that the capitalism has gone to her head and that she is more concerned with making money than magick. it can happen to the best of us, but you do not want to buy a book about spirituality from someone who is "all about the money". i use it in my coven as a "what NOT to do" book 
 I see that some people were helped by this book.  I would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex.  The advice to virgins was disgusting.  The writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it.  The writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive.  I thought the book was sick.  It turns women into an object of function. It also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive.  The authors are a husband and wife but I can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book.  The cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that. I'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 What a lot of self-centered, pompous baloney!  McCort must have got his drinking buddies to write many of the deliriously exuberant rave reviews here.  Luckily I didn't pay a cent for this thing, which is still more than it's worth.  Library audio book.  Phooey 
 I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off.   His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His  phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening.  To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.  I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet. 
 We used this text in a graduate nursing research course.  It covers materials superficially and is not useful for planning research, especially qualitative research.  The statistics section was particularly useless.  While it describes many statistical tests it does not provide the information needed to actually conduct the tests nor does it compare and contrast the usefullness of one test verses another 
 As one of the Co-Founders and former Director of Guatemalan Operations for PlanetOutreach, I discovered this book was published after leaving PlanetOutreach in 2002. The author was misinformed about how our internet cafe / telecenter was actually launched and who was involved in making it happen. In fact, the author made it seem that PlanetOutreach was a project of eBay and it certainly was not, although we did receive a grant from their foundation to make it happen. Persons mentioned as being a significant part of this project came down to San Pedro to visit only; from a few days (Meg W.and Henry G.- to take a tour of the village and project) to three weeks (Griffin - who helped with painting bookshelves only). Naturally, I was stunned to see credit given to people when they played a very small role (if any!) versus the four us who founded it (Karina, Ron, Debbie and me). Naturally, I was disappointed to see how the author chose to innacurately profile this innovative enterprise.  Two of the first employees I hired and trained, Mary and Otto,  continue to stay in touch with me through email. In fact, Otto, the first employee of PlanetOutreach, and Cata, his wife, gave birth to their first daughter in 2005 and named her after me; I saw her in Sept 2005 and she's beautiful! 
 This guy took the simplest, barest points of The Richest Man in Babylon (albeit with proper homage... when an author says "pay yourself first" he's alluding to George S. Clason in 'Babylon') and blew them into a big book with a big marketing campaign and a big pile of baloney.  Much of the advice in the book, when Bach starts playing with numbers, winds up being contradictory.  The principles aren't bad (although they aren't his) but his specious, overblown examples wind up compromising the value of the whole message taken together.  About the only thing this book is good for is working children or teenagers with very limited imaginations, who can't connect to The Richest Man in Babylon or aren't capable of grasping its allegorical implications (like growing food in your own garden when you own your home... it's not entirely literal you see) or won't care for the more abstract or mature messages about personal honor and the responsibility of financial wisdom in challenging settings.  So this jerk sells a ton of truly mediocre books and looks like some kind of a superstar.  I don't like it.  If this and Who Moved My Cheese are where self-help books are headed, then I think a revival of Samuel Smiles, Orison Marden, and Napoleon Hill would be just around the corner.  At least, that's the hope

 It was so bland and uninformative I actually returned it, very rare I return a book, I can usually find something in it I like!  : 
 I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie & Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!"  The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling 
 A 17" Mac Book Pro or Powerbook fits nicely in this backpack, and there's plenty of extra room for the power supply, spare batteries, cables, thumb drives, EVDO cards, etc.  Brenthaven changed the design a few months ago.  My wife has an earlier one, which has a less comfortable handle but a removable inner sleeve that velcros closed.  The newer style does not have the internal velcro closure, and this was a very costly omission for me.  My backpack, containing my 17" Powerbook, tipped over, fully zipped, and fell approximately two feet to the floor, with the top of the backpack striking pavement.  Fearing the worst but hoping for the best, I removed the computer and was horrified to discover that it had slid right through the internal flap and taken the full brunt of the impact, massively denting and dislocating the side of the computer and damaging the PCMCIA slot.  Applecare does not cover this sort of damage, so I ended up eating a multi-hundred dollar repair bill.  The backpack is comfortable and capacious, but the lack of protection for a top impact was a deep disappointment 
 I was very disappointed with this book especially since it was branded with Sunset Magazine's name.   Very basic vanilla information on garages and workshops.   If you are just now learning what a garage is, then this book is for you 
 Sorry-- I don't know what people are raving about.  I am an avid epicurean, and have gone to most good restaurants in NY.  I just don't think Balthazar's recipes or food holds a candle to other NY institutions, like Gotham, Gramercy, etc.  The food at and recipes from Balthazar always tastes a little too greasy and unrefined given how many steps are involved.  Sorry, that's just my personal opinion after making almost ten of the Balthazar recipes 
 I listened to the abridged tape version of this book and after reading the other reviews, I'm glad that I did. However, the tapes did contain an interesting interview with Fr. Greeley in which he indicated that part of the reason for writing the novel was to reach more people.  He had previously written about clergy abuse in sociological papers. As a piece of fiction, I found this novel to be rather mediocre.  Having spent five years in the Catrolic seminary, I found it quite interesting that Greeley's main character goes off to college with the intention of entering the seminary after graduation.  However, when his childhood sweetheart appears on the scene he resumes his sexual activity with her. There is a lot of that in the novel-Greeley knows what sells books! But wait!  Our young priest to be then dumps his girlfriend and by graduation time he is a repentant sinner and he enters the seminary (after fighting-off the apathy of the local church officials). I found Greeley's portrayal of Fr. Hoffmann's treatment when he speaks out about the clergy abuse to be heavy-handed.  Come on; how many accusers of priestly pedophiles found themselves exiled to psychiatrict institutions?   This book shows that Father Greeley has many axes to grind with the Catholic Church and he uses this book as a forum to take some cheap shots without really making any positive contributions to healing the wounds. 
   This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word "book" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)   So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book.    
 We just bought a house and I bought many interior design/home decorating books recently and screened through a bunch in a book store. I bought this one because I saw it was named as a best seller, and I seriously do not understand how could this become a best seller, maybe best seller 5 tears ago? When the book arrived from Amzon, both my husband and I were shocked: Who would want to design like that? The pictures are simply ugly!!! Both the pictures and text are so dated, and the text type is the smallest I have ever seen. I could not bare to read two paragraphs because my eyes were too strained 
 This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK 
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she used to have the It's A wonderful Life in color on VHS.I recored over this VHS about 5 years ago, and i have felt terrible ever since. AMazon said that this edition was in color, so i decided that this was a perfect gift for my mom. I received the DVD today, and i am so dissapointed that it is not color? Why did they tell us it wasn't 
 "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" was not condensed, but was merely the play reworded.  Granted that it did help decipher hidden meanings behind some of the dialogue, or certain innuendo's which can go over one's head, but other than that, it was not helpful or insightful.  I think it actually took me longer to read the Spark Notes, than the actual play itself.  If you do get this book, of course you know to read "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" AFTER you have read "A Man For All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts."  I do not recommend 
 cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.  
 I want my money back. I feel like a burned a hole in my wallet. The only songs I like on this CD is Hero, Shelter, My Nutmeg Phantasy, Farewell, and Main Titles but the others suck and most of them aren't even Spiderman. Shelter is a great song it's from Fast and the Furious and it's also in the movie in the part where Peter wants the money after he wrestles Bones but the reason why I like the song is because it's from The Fast and the Furious and that's a great movie. The CD cover was great to look at it even had images from the movie including a cool 3D Spiderman cover on front but from what I got when I listened to it some of the songs weren't even in the movie it's just songs that some dude really wanted money from Sony and he just put the Soundtrack in stock but main reason why I got it is because I really wanted to listen to the themes from the trailers like Hell Above Water, Pompeii, and Leave You Far Behind but they weren't on there including the World Trade Center theme it wasn't on there too but still I'm warning you Spiderman fans do not buy the soundtrack but if you really loved the score go buy it I own it and listen to it all the time it's great but please do not waste your money on this soundtrack stick with Danny Elfman's amazing score. Spiderman 2 soundtrack is way better than this piece of crap CD. 
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 Okay, I confess I'm still plowing my way through this book. I'm on page 157, I think, and while the bodies were revealed way up front, everything else I've read thus far is Cissie being Cissie and Andy being dumber than a brick. A little of this mother-daughter dynamic went a long way in the first book, but this time it's simply over the top. As humor, it falls flat. As a mystery, it's *what* mystery? Maybe the second half of the book will pick up the pace a little, but getting there is a challenge I'm not certain I'm willing to take 
 Early in the text Cashdan makes clear the fact that fairy tales were never intended as children's stories, nor were they meant to convey lessons. Rather, they were a source of entertainment and adventure for adults - characteristics that made the same stories viable later to be adapted for children. He asserts that, rather than teaching specific moral lessons, fairy tales do help children learn to deal with the struggles of everyday life, particularly struggles with what he terms "the seven deadly sins of childhood:" vanity, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, lust, and deceit. He asserts that the tales teach children through subtle means to resolve "struggles between the positive and negative forces in the self."   Cashdan characterizes the witch-villain as an external manifestation and magnification of the child-hero/ine's inner flaws. Later he states that good and bad female figures relate to the child's positive and negative experiences with the mother figure in her life (never addressing the fact that the good mother is almost always dead or absent in the stories). Cashdan quickly dismisses the possibility of misogyny in the negative portrayal of stepmothers and female villains simply  because fairy tales aren't meant to be taken as faithfully realistic.   Later still he returns to the idea of the witch as representative of the hero/ine's sinful characteristics. The primary premise of his text is that the "Witch must die because the witch embodies the sinful parts of the self." This concept reinforces the patriarchal implication that evil is feminine in nature and suggests that it is the "negative" female aspects of the child's character which must be annihilated in order for her to live happily ever after.   Cashdan also claims that witches in fairy tales are often depicted as cannibalistic in order to identify them as fully repugnant and therefore deserving of annihilation; in fact, cannibalism was perceived as an earmark of witchcraft during the European witch hunts. This simple statement (as well as his flaccid bibliography) betrays the fact that Cashdan's text is poorly researched and that he often substitutes speculation for informed observations. Due to its inherent inconsistencies and oversights, Cashdan's text is utterly useless unless to provide points to argue against 
 *warning* spoilers What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen. 
 Book is okay.  It avoids some very difficult questions such as what if one is not a heterosexual practitioner 
 Jerry you sound so good singing salsa. Why do you do this to your fans?? I was very disappointed with this CD. There are only 3 salsa tracks. No vale la pena comprarlo 
 Don't waste your money or time on this piece of trash.  What they are doing is trying to cash in on the Da Vinci code with something that has nothing to do with the subject.  This is so poorly written I can't believe it was published.  DON'T PURCHASE this unless you want to revel at how bad it is.  
 I read this book when I was actually in Borneo where I spent over a year, visiting many of the places described in the book. I found it plainly ridiculous! The real Borneo is nothing like the mystical "deepest-darkest" fantasy-world described in this story, nor was it even when those travels were supposedly taking place... It is amazing that this book got such good marks from other readers and probably the best example of how many high tales a writer can get away with about far-away places where most readers haven't been. :-)  A more realistic description of the same places on a similar trip could be read in "A Stroll Through Borneo" by James Barclay 
 This book provided a method to gather requirement efficiently but the rest of the method should be revised 
 Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day 
 I have not bought this particular video, but I did buy another set of GGW videos a few months ago, and I COMPLETELY regret it.  This is the worst purchasing experience I've ever had.  Many people have complained about the horrible customer service at GGW.  In my case, I paid extra on my order for speedy delivery.  The charge went against my credit card, so they got immediate payment from me.  My videos were supposed to have been delivered within a couple days, but it wound up taking a couple MONTHS instead!  And only after I complained did they finally deliver them.  But they still didn't reimburse me for the extra expense I had paid for the speedy delivery that never happened.  And if that isn't bad enough, for the last month these jerks have been calling me every day, several times a day.  I get calls at home, I get calls at work.  They called me three times just today.  This is harrassment!  I'm right now researching what my legal options are because their incessant phone calls are making me crazy.  Can you imagine having to explain unsolicited calls you're receiving at work from GGW?  Unless you want to go through the hell I'm being put through, do yourself a favor and please avoid these sorry jerks 
 This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel 
 IT IS A VERY INSPIRING BOOK I REALLY HATED IT SO THANK YOU FOR WRITTING IT! IT REALLY TOLD WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!   
 I read this graphic novel and saw the play and met Neil Gaiman, all in the same day. The reason Stephen King admires this guy is because he is able to create the illusion to his audience that they are perhaps profound, or  well-read somehow. Not the case. This one will leave you cold, no matter  how many times you "read" it/look at the little pictures. Oh and  girls-- Neil Gaiman's voice sounds exactly like Richard Dreyfuss 
 I don't think these dvd's are that great. I'm not sure if I just don't like Mari Winsor, or if I don't like pilates, but I bought these dvd's and only used them a few times before I lost interest. Some of the moves aren't that easy and others don't seem to do anything at all. I plan to stick with TaiBo 
 I could not finish this because it was written from such a negative and downbeat perspective 
 It seems that Ms. Steete has really lost her touch.  I was frustrated at the very slow pace with little or no character development until the last few pages when we learn that apparently it is okay with Ms. Steele to cheat on your spouse 
 This is a pretty basic and simplistic introduction to small business finance. Many of the "tricks" revealed in it for raising money simply will not work in the real world 
 As advertised on the cover of this book, anachronistic me-generation guru Peck and his wife Lily set off on a tour of Britain's legendary stone circles, right? Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the "it" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, "larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined." Jeesh 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 Not really helpful to the aspiring autobiographer, as Zinsser's approach to teaching the genre seems to be to present his own memoirs and explain how wonderful they are 
 When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.  Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind" 
 Well the premise of the book was enough to get me to buy it; I love old houses and late 19th century Americana, fascinated by interesting families and the thought of generations of Bostonians returning to the same house each summer.  Some of the book was interesting, but overall I found it very dull and slow moving.  I was not motivated by the family or the story to read further, and I would have been satisfied with a 4 page article on this subject matter in "The New Yorker" or "Old House Journal".   I got 75% through the book and realized there was no real plot twist waiting in the next chapter.  So I donated it to my local public library.   That said, it seems plenty of reviewers who have summer homes at Cape Cod loved this book.  
 Jeremy Brett was by this time indeed "the dying detective," but  his real-life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic  rendition of one of Conan Doyle's more tasteless Holmes stories. The  original features some of Holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of  poor Watson, but since this series made such a thing of their friendship,  the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it. Stick with the Brett  episodes from the mid-80s, when he was fresh in the role and the  adaptations were true and intelligent 
 The second half of the book is a neverending parade of cartoon violence.  The cast begins to blur and fade together as our hero suffers one beating/shooting/injury after another but keeps on going with the help of an occasional percocet instead of three weeks in the hospital.  By the end I had lost track of who was doing what to whom and for what reason.  Improbable coincidences pile up and let the hero's pursuers track him down against all odds.  I think I read and enjoyed the author's first book but this one was like finishing a dull assignment.  It was a chore to read at the end.   
 For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic, Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant "sequel". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a "so bad it's good" B flick. But the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But avoid this sequel at all costs. I hate to put down any product, but I feel that this one deserves it 
 I must confess that this book was not a pleasure to read.  The trivia portrayed in the Roosevelt-Churchill relationship was at times interesting and even amusing but when all is said and done both men made decisions NOT based on their supposed special relationship but on the needs of the day.  Roosevelt was at first suspicious of Churchill, then came to be a fan or his, but turned again suspicious of Churchill as he pursued the courting of Stalin.  I am not convinced that there really was a meaninful and consequential relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill.  Without this relationship much the same would have probably occurred.  Meacham does not demonstrate that his thesis is valid.    Having recently read Meacham's analysis of the Jesus Question in Newsweek I am not surprised that his work here is superficial and jejune -- the work of a journalist not a scholar.  He is a bright young man but doesn't have anything to say which would last more than a week 
 Salerno picks on an enormous target - the empty-head "self-help" speakers that fill hotel meeting rooms across the country to hear platitudes and dubious advice.  He informs readers that 3,500 - 4,000 new self-help books appeared in '03 alone, with the fastest growing sectors being the softest and least utilitarian - inspirational, spiritual, and relationship-oriented.  "Psychotherapy has a chancy success rate even in a one-on-one setting over a period of years," writes a Harvard Medical School researcher quoted by the author.  "How can you expect to break a lifetime of bad behavioral habits through a couple of banquet-hall seminars or setting down with some book?"  Salerno divides the self-help industry into two groups - "victimization" - eg. Dad was an alcoholic, etc., so stop beating yourself up - you need help!  (Rev. Jesse Jackson is a premier example of this approach.)  The other is "you can be anything you want - you just need to want it badly enough" - the province of an endless parade of motivational speakers.  (Though there is certainly truth to success being related to effort, few have the ABILITY to reach the stars.)  Salerno also suggests that self-help vendors sometimes cause more help than benefit - eg. talking someone into leaving a less than Hollywood marriage, and ending up with worse.   Nonetheless, overall Salerno fails - badly.  While rightly accusing the industry of being rife with those lacking credible evidence of effectiveness, Salerno nonetheless allows his criticisms of individuals to dwell on mostly irrelevant earlier mistakes or lesser ventures.  I was particularly put off by his nonsensical criticism of Suze Orman - an individual whose financial advice books are very well researched and useful.  And as I earlier alluded, a little positive motivation is probably good for all of us.  So which is the bigger SHAM - Salerno's book, or those he writes about?  I honestly don't know 
 Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc 
 This is, hands down, the worst perfume I have ever smelled. If you're in the mood to smell sexy, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell girlish, don't wear this. If you're in the mood to smell classy, don't wear this. In other words, I have no idea what kind of mood you have to be in to actually want to wear this. I literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought, and they all agreed this was awful. The only person I can imagine wearing this is a senior citizen. It just smells terrible and drab.. and it wasn't that I got a bad bottle either, I've smelled it in stores and it's the same. Truly terrible 
 This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet 
 To anyone who buys this toy, keep the box and receipt handy.  We may be the odd one out, but we purchased this toy and it didn't work. The legs on Manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball.  This didn't happen.  Rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire', and if we were lucky one would shoot out - after great effort. It comes with three foam balls, two of which fit, the third was slightly too big and would jam.  Ours is going back to the store today.  
 I grew up in a home in which my repressed, puritanical parents never even uttered the word "sex" and told me in all seriousness at age 4 that the stork delivered me to them. When my 5-year-old recently asked me how babies got into their mommies' tummies, I was determined to arm her with the correct information in an age-appropriate manner. I bought this book based on customer reviews and nearly fell over backwards in disbelief when I began to read it. Brushing off a young child's questions by telling him or her that the answer will be revealed on his/her eight birthday sends the message that sex is a taboo subject. I agree with the reviewer who said that the "big talk" at age eight is a goofy concept (and outdated as well). I work with children, and I can safely say that today they're so sophisticated that age eight is actually too late for the "big talk". Building up a child's anticipation with talk about this "totally cool and awesome" secret is laughable at best. Most kids simply aren't going to buy it.    I'm all for advocating sex within the confines of a committed relationship, and in fact it's how I plan to introduce the topic to my daughter. However, I don't plan to follow this book's advice. Better books are out there, including some that are recommended by this book's authors 
 This is a godawful movie, a waste of several million bucks by Universal and whoever else was responsible.  They could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the "sexy" health club craze of the 80s. Actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make.  Lucas or Spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so.  
 When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time. 
 John Wiley & co owes me a couple of pages full of errata or, at least, my money back. (I note there are, at this time, 23 used or new copies of this book) Books on options strategy and management with plenty of FX examples are few and far between. The only thing good about this book is that the chapters are bite-size. I'm only about half-way thru the book, but if I can expect a similar number of errors for the rest, then shame on John Wiley for allowing this book to publish before extensive editing.  Two handfuls of errors may not be much, but 79.95 is a lot to pay. Lucky for me I have a pretty strong grasp of the basics, but what if a beginner interbank trader got a hold of this book? It's surprising that someone of Nassim Taleb's eminence would lend his name in editorial reviews of this book 
 I brought this book thinking it was be an insight into the 1930s,but it is a dull book written for children. It's not worth [what] I paid. Buyer beware 
 Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be "Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's", or, even better, check out "Transformer" or "Rock 'n' Roll Animal" 
 I thought this book could have been much better. The chapters on dating and jobs are helpful. However, I just can't seem to get past the chapters on body image...To me it felt like the author was trying to say, "your gonna get fatter as you get older so you can better accept it now. You'll be even more fatter if you have children, so the sooner you accept this the better"  Excuse me, but this is supposed to make me feel better about my body? Maybe it would come across better if she said something along the lines of "You may find your metabolism slowing down, but thats nothing a little exercise and eating right can't fix". I am almost willing to put money on the fact that the author is overweight cause this comes through very much in her writing.  That alone just made the book a rotten deal for me.  Some parts of the book rang true for me, like examples of how your mind changes as you age. But i really don't think there is much advice worth paying for.  
 It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.  Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36). General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.  Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism 
 I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase.  Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends.  There are even two identical reviews back to back.  This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype 
 I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously.  I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable.  This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.  My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism. 
 I have not read this book and I do not plan to read this book. It's not that I'm a fan of George W. Bush, it's because I don't want to read this boring, retarded piece of trash. I hate this, and I hate that blah, blah, blah. I have not read this book for the same reason that very few people listen to Al Franken. It's because most people hate reading stupid political rubbish.   I then would try to imagine how miserable my life would be posting reviews attacking Michael Moore, Al Franken, and all those other left-wingers who write cheap books like this, so I could dilute their average rating. Of course I could say that the author of this book, Clint Willis, is a hate-monger, and that leftists always yell accusations of "hate speech" whenever any Republican speaks out against them. Now that would boost my helpful votes 
 I am a fan of weird cult and experimental films but El Topo becomes tedious after a while. It was one of the original "midnight movies" and probably worked better in that setting. El Topo (more interesting for its imagery than plot) comes off as a stoned, somewhat campy film highly derivative of Luis Bunuel, Arrabel (Viva La Muerte) and is similar to the early experimental films of Werner Herzog (Even Dwarves Started Small, Fata Morgana). That said if you've heard of all these films and are in the mood for a surrealistic, sacreligious western that drags on for a long time, then El Topo has its moments 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 Words can't describe how bad this is. However, I read reveiws for volume 8, and the reviewer pretty mucyh describes what I think, and I will quote him.....  "Well. Seems like these talentless, gold-toothed imbeciles are really getting rich from churning out this junk faster than Detroit churns out cars because dumb pre-teens and wiggers keep buying into this fad... so I'm going to cash in on it! Quick! Before it dies out! I'm going to make my OWN unlistenable, wretched pop-rap album!   So here I go, with the steps:   1.) Pick out stupid, laughable moniker (IE "Chingy", "Nelly", etc.). Hmm... how about "Dippety D"? I know, I know, it sounds like a Warner Brothers cartoon... but hey, this is what makes money, so who am I to argue?   2.) Go to the mall and buy $500 worth of oversized South Pole and Mecca clothing.   3.) Get a friend with an old electronic keyboard. Actually, scratch the friend part. I can do it myself.   4.) Pick out one of the 16 loaded beats. Choose a tempo.   5.) Put it on, and record myself mumbling over it. Subject matter must not exceed the range of "munny, secks, thugstaz, wummenzz". Oh yeah, gotta curse a lot too. My title track shall be me just endlessly bleating "DIPPETY DIPPETY DIPPETY D!!!!"   6.) When I write the words/lyrics, misspell everything horribly. Hmm. What's a good album title? I know! "Dippity D Duz Da Derrrty Deed".   7.) Shoot the album cover. Wear the aforementioned wigger clothing, scowl like an idiot, and show off my "blang" (fake).   8.) Release, sell the single to MTV, and become a millionaire overnight! It's that easy! AND it requires NO TALENT WHATSOEVER! Those of you clamoring for the "No" button below, wait 'til you hear my new single, "For Sheezy My Wheezy"! It'll soon be blasting at a local school dance near you!   No. Forget it. I'm not going to do any of that. If I make an album, it'll be of my OWN musical merit. I'll actually put some effort into it, and make something I can take pride in.   Avoid.   Show me the "Not Helpful" votes!" ---Eggplant  I completely agree with him 101% percent, and he knows what music is 
 I bought this the day it came out and watched a couple of episodes without incident and then began watching "The Bend In The River" when the problems started. At 1 hour 10 minutes and 43 seconds into the episode right when Hannibal says "sure" the dvd just stopped and went to the main menu. The rest of the episode was missing...it just stopped so I tried it out on two other dvd players I have here and then figured I got a bad copy and went up to the store to exchange it. Well, once I got it home the second one did the same exact thing, so I exchanged it a third time. The third copy actually plays through the episode but freezes for about 5 seconds in the exact same place that the others were messed up. I haven't even gotten to the other 5 DVD's but my assumption from reading the reviews here is that they are going to have problems too.   I can't understand how they release these seasons of the A-Team so painfully slow at Universal and can let something with this many errors reach the stores. In the 10 months since the release of Season 2 could they not have had some type of quality control make sure that the Season 3 DVD's actually played?   This release has absolutely no bonus features unlike the Columbia House collectors edition ones, which have some outtakes and other things. And I have to wonder with this release just like the other two seasons why can they not put chapters in where the commercial breaks are instead of having to fast forward to get back to the spot I left off? Just like Season 2 these are double sided DVD's which scratch very easily and make all kinds of noises in the DVD player, I would have liked 6 single sided DVD's much better. And one last problem is that when you put the DVD you absolutely have to watch the Universal Studios introduction for about 10 seconds because you cannot skip it and access the menu.   There are two good things I can say about this release the first being that it's the A-Team, which is the best television show of all time and this is probably my favorite season. The second good thing is that a coupon is enclosed for $5 off of Season 4 when it gets released. To have released this Season with this many errors and problems on the DVD's is an insult to A-Team fans everywhere who have waited 20+ years to buy this on DVD. Universal needs to recall all of them and issue working copies.    Update: I have just gotten off the phone with Universal and they have said that they will replace the DVD for me and others who are having problems. You can call them at 972-293-5903 or email ushe.consumerrelations@worldmarkinc.com and put A-Team Season 3 replacement in the subject line. I have added a star to my review since they're customer service was friendly and returned my call promptly, but I have still subtracted a star for each trip I have made to the store. 
 I would think twice before ordering this edition.  It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books.  Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type.  I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet). One advantage of reading online is the easy ability to look up vocabulary.   For the price, it's simply not worth it 
 Completely and utterly out of context. The author of this book takes things that appear to be out of context and lists them in this bias, prejudice and predisposed book. He appears to have prior knowledge of understanding the Bible, and has many points of topics that seem as if he is right. The reason that it is wrong is that he takes verses of the Bible and compares them to other passages that have similar subjects, but are talking about completely different situations. The whole passage, along with the text above and below that verse need to be read. The author points out many "infallible" contradictions that include numbers. During transition from the Greek and Hebrew to English there have been many different translations made. It is possible that a zero gets left off or 1 too many get put in. This is an error of man (key piece of information), not God's Word. Although man has made errors in translation, this is not God's fault, nor have any of these errors changed the doctrine of the Bible. Although the author makes it clear that he is not a believer, I think that it is written from a very bias view that has no true evidence of his theory. I would not recommend this book to others, but if you do read it, please keep this information in mind. 
 I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better. 
 I found this book to be very disappointing.  All this book basically is is interviews with doctors and patients in regards to different treatment alternatives.  If you are trying to TREAT fibromyalgia, i definitely do not recommend this book.  If you really want someones gripes and groans about fibromyalgia you can get that point of view FREE on line on Fibromyalgia web sites.  If you want alternative treatments options- try The Fibromyalgia Nutrition Guide, although this book is all about nutrition, it is very easy to us and very helpful- All us fibromyalgics know about homeopathic stuff already such as massage and Alternative Treatments just reiterates that and has patients and doctor points of view on Massage, Chiropractic care, Etc... 
 I was not impressed with this book although I'm a big fan of Focus on the Family and Dr. Dobson. I just felt this book didn't deliver much at all. I think Boundaries with Teens would be a much better choice. I actually have the book on CD. I listen while waiting to pick kids up from school.  It offers a lot of great advice and suggestions on life with teens. 
 This book is good at covering old style (i.e. wire lead) discrete components and Smith charts.  But it is so out of date though that I do not recommend it for anyone but a ham doing their own circuits by hand.  No referenced book was written later than 1980.  No computers existed when this was written so there is no software design approaches mentioned.  No surface mount technology is covered.  FETs are only covered on one page.  Transistor references are obsolete.  This is a small book with lots of big Smith charts taking up many pages 
 I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before 
 This product is actually quite small.  Even though is says mini, I still expected it to be a little bit bigger.  Also, it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it.  The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone 
 It is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. I suspect Mr. Trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-Step programs.The truth is that one size does not fit all. Some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. Read this book and try this method. If it does not work try another one. They are all good in their own way. But Mr. Trimpey: If one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on AA, you should be ashamed of yourself 
 One of the things I have enjoyed about Ketchum's works is how readable they are and Victory at Yorktown is no exception. That being said,I did not enjoy this work as much as I did his previous works.  One reason might be that I read Decisive Day, The Winter Soldiers and Saratoga before I knew much about the Revolutionary war, and I have read a lot of other books since then.  I didn't really feel as though I learned anything new in Victory at Yorktown.  It gives a brief account of the campaign in the Carolinas and Arnold's treason before delving into Yorktown. The description of the battle, and the Naval engagements prior to,  seemed to lack any emotion or excitement.  The personal accounts he provides are really the same ones that every other book about the revolution gives.  This could be a good book for those reading about the later stages of the war for the first time, however those who are well read on the subject may want to skip it. 
 This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story.  But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie.  Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie....  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend...  much like the more recent movie about King Arthur.  Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers......  So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating... 
 This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  It  drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages.  The book could have been good, could have saved itself if it had ended on page 152 instead of page 195.  The story after 152 is irrelevant, pointless, lacks continuity, and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included.  Instead of the sad story of the young writer, you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself, justify his existence, and generally prove that at 50 he amounted to something 
 The powers that be at the fishwrapper that is RS magazine have compounded a felony by updating their album guide from two previous editions. On the plus side, Dave Marsh and John Swenson, the two high-falootin' ignoramuses who were in charge of the earlier edition apparently had nothing to do with this one, which in almost any circumstance would guarantee improvement. However, the writers who have taken over for them are just as bad, and thus this edition of the Guide emerges as even more irrelevant and vacuous than its predecessor, if such a thing is possible. The discographies provided for artists of long standing are usually hopelessly incomplete, muddled, and inaccurate, and oftentimes bands or artists who were still performing at the time of this volume's release are treated as if their careers were over years ago. Mark Coleman, in particular, continually embarrasses himself with his inacurracies, superficial knowledge, and attempts to sound "hip" and "on the cutting edge" which are even more pathetic than Marsh's were. I agree fully with Peter Laffey's review below. Most of the reviewers at amazon.com can provide a more intelligent music album review than any writer at Rolling Stone 
 A few of the diary entries were interesting to read (I especially liked the story of the china doll), but the quilt blocks were a major disappointment. Each block was named after an entry in the corresponding diary entry rather than by its commonly used name. No patterns given for the blocks, only a line diagram and a small picture of an actual fabric block. Civil War Women by Barbara Brackman is a much better choice for historical background, diary entries and actual patterns 
 I love Billy Blanks Lower Body and Ultimate Bootcamp dvds.  I tried his Ab Bootcamp, thinking it would be great too, but what a letdown.  I'm not sure why so many other reviewers liked it so much...maybe it's just me.  His favorite move is standing and rotating the torso from side to side.  I felt it in the abs a little, but he keeps going back to it OVER AND OVER and it bothered my back. Also he makes some comment that your neck will stop hurting if you just suck it up and strengthen the neck muscles.  If you are pulling on your neck and using bad form that he teaches you, you can get hurt.  Most of the video is done standing up.  He focuses more on the obliques (sides) than the rectus abdominus (front).  At first I liked the move where you rotate your hip up and bring your elbow down, isolating the obliques.  But I got bored of it after 10 minutes of the same thing.  He does crunches standing up too.  You stand in this hunched over squatting position (which I'm sure is bad for the back), put your hands behind your head, and contract your abs, pulling your head down (pulling on the neck).  I thought this was a lot of work for the rest of the body but I didn't feel it in my abs at all.  I prefer to do crunches on the floor, which uses more resistance since you're lifting the upper body against gravity.  He does have some good floor moves in there at the end that I've never seen before.  It might be worth a rental to see those.  As usual, Billy shows his lack of stretching knowledge.  His stretching routine usually involves swinging the arms like in Tai Chi...which really doesn't stretch anything.  I found it weird that he does a quad stretch and a hamstring stretch at the end of an Ab workout.  Wouldn't you expect an ab stretch?  Or a back stretch?  This video is about 30 minutes.  It might seem short, but when you're targeting only 1 muscle group, that's a long time.  I thought my abs would be twice as sore compared to another dvd I have which is 15 mins, but the only thing that's sore is my back.  I guess I'll keep looking - I've heard good things about Gilad's Abs Workout 
 I picked up a copy of this because of the number of people telling me that this was so much better than Conway's other poorly-done books. After reading it, I strongly disagree!!  Beginning in the introduction, when she incorrectly states that "the words Wicca, Witchcraft and the Craft are actually interchangeable", there is very little here that can't be found in dozens of other phoney McWicca-lite introductory texts.   Her history is based on the myth that there was once a peaceful matriarchy, and everyone worshipped "the Goddess" until evil patriarchy came along and spoiled everything. She would do well to actually read some of the accurate archeological works listed in her bibliography!  She then proceeds to confuse the term "Paganism". In spite of the way she misuses the word, "Paganism" is actually a large group of related, but highly dissimilar religious. It is not a single path "based on a specific pantheon of deities", and there are certainly more than "only a few differences between Wicca and Paganism, besides the difference in their ages". (And NO religion can be dated back to the Stone Age! NO ONE knows what beliefs existed then, what their 'religious' practices were, or even if they HAD any religious beliefs!) She also defines many Traditions within Wicca inaccurately, and shows little understanding of the history of Wicca, or the various practices that define it's many branches.  When speaking of Deities, she first states that Wicca is polytheistic, then proceeds to "explain" that all Gods are a reflection of a single God archetype, and even the Gods are subservient to the Goddess. (That's not polytheism.) She also speaks of Triple aspects of Goddess, saying that this is a universal concept, and that it has been recognized "from the beginning of religion". This is untrue. (She has quite a habit of stating historical "facts" that are contrary to the archeological evidence, without saying where she is obtaining her "information". She also frequently speaks of conclusions of how found items were used or what they signify that are very different from what the scholars who are trained to interpret such finds conclude. Especially when the archeologists determine that NO conclusions can be made from the evidence available.)  In my opinion, Ms Conway's version of "wicca" is a blend of New Age thought, Ceremonial Magic influence, and poor research. While I don't doubt that it could be used to create a viable and valid spiritual path, it bears little relation to actual Wicca. If one wishes to learn about Wicca, I would strongly suggest starting with A Witch Alone by Marian Green, then moving to books such as Gerald Gardner's recently republished classics. No, it won't be as easy as what Ms. Conway has written... but *real* Wicca cannot be condensed into a 400-page how-to manual 
 Not what I expected.  This bench is ok for a petite woman, not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall... 
 This is a reasonable light that certainly does a good job of making you visible to motorists.  I would agree with the reviewer about brightness - it is not really bright enough to use as the only source of illumination.  For me the most disappointing factor is the 'no tools' fitting strap.  It grips poorly on glossy surfaces - like many handlebars, for example! I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this.  Worse, the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use.  The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality.  Pros - Good light for sodium lit city streets - Really waterproof - Solid case  Cons - The 'no tools' strap simply sucks. - You'll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride.  Not really worth the investment.  I bought a cheaper 5-led light - with a proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - that I am far happier with.  The CatEye is now an expensive spare flashlight. 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 Faith Hill has been known (both celebrated and criticized) for testing the waters.  She has never "played it safe"...until now.  First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for "Cry".  "Cry" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  "Lead Me On", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.  As for "Fireflies", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked "Cry", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.    The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.    I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of "This Kiss" and "Breathe".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: "Fireflies" is not selling as well as "Breathe" and "Faith" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the "I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you" image that Faith has unveiled 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I am currently in the middle of a massive remodeling project in my house.  I bought this book to learn some simple techniques for installing the molding that was so easy to rip out, but is a pain to put back in.  I read  the book from cover to cover and I found that the book lacked on  illustrations/pictures.  Most of the explanations are only given in  paragraph form, and was hard to follow for me.  This is the only do it  yourself book that I regret buying from Amazon 
 Then you have some idea what this kind of music should be in the highest order. And you will know it is too far for the WhiteStripes to make it done.  Uninteresting music is doomed 
 As a (once) big Jurassic 5 fan, I couldn't believe how terrible this album was.  The lyircs got old fast, the beats were boring and like another reviewer mentioned, I got sick of the whole "girl/getting over shyness" type of songs.  This album reminded me of a no-name group that wants to get big fast so their label puts a whole bunch of big name stars on the album to gain more fans and radio play...NOT what I would expect from a solid group like J5 at all!      Power in Numbers was just okay to me, and they totally lost me with this latest release; I will not be buying another J5 album from here on out.  It's no wonder Cut Chemist left the group.. 
 This book, as well as the sequels, contain a few truths, many half-truths and many falsehoods. God has given us free will and would not force someone's hand to write things. This book states there is no wrong and no right. And in one of the sequels, he states that Hitler is in heaven *because he doesn't view his actions as wrong.* What convenient thinking for the rest of us! And what dangerous thinking! The road to Heaven is narrow, not a superhighway. I fear many souls will be lost by following the false teachings of this book. 
 Before you waste your money on this or any other of Breggin's rantings, read all about him on the Quackwatch website. This kind of pseudoscientific garbage is just what stressed parents of ADHD kids don't need to be spending their time on 
 Very exciting journey using the strenght of metaphores. Just be careful that metaphores are a representation of reality, not exactly that 
 I bought this CD because I loved Mediterranea but this is not as good and I'm sorry I bought it. It does not have the depth of the earlier CD & mostly just a frantic pace, as if to be showing off his guitar skills. It is one-sided having no deviation, no slower tunes.  Some I couldn't stand, the others are just okay, if played quietly. 
 Very disappointed in his research.  All of his studies were conducted by a government research group of somekind.   Mr. Piscatella states on page 51 that he recommends Canola Oil.  Really?  Is he not aware that Canola was developed from the rape seed and is thus unsuited for human consumption.  Why?  because it contains a long-chain fatty acid called erucic acid, which under some circumstances is associated with fibrotic heart lesions coupled with a very high sulphur content and goes rancid easily (Nourishing Traditions, 2001).  Not to mention Mr. Piscatella condemns tropical oils which are high in lauric acid which are not only stable at high temperatures but has high antifungal and antimicrobial properties.  Guess where lauric acid also can be found?  Mother's milk and we certainly don't condemn that.........yet!  On cholesterol, he's just wrong.  Or should I say the FDA is wrong.  On page 21 Mr. Piscatella emphasizes the importance of LDL and HDL ratios.  This is a typical FDA propaganda tool.  In the book, The Cholesterol Myths by Uffe Ravnshov, MD,PhD, Mr. Ravnshov states, "LDL-cholesterol is neither centrally nor causally important, it has not the strongest and most consistent relationship to risk of CHD, it has not a direct relationship to the rate of CHD, and it has not been studied in more than a dozen randomized trials..."  Mr. Piscatella is mistaken regarding soy.  He never distinguishes the difference between fermented soy products (tofu, miso) and unfermented soy products (soy milk).  Asians rarely consume unfermented soy products, if at all.  One thing Mr. Piscatella is correct on is the importance of triglyceride levels and margarine and shortening products.  Those products should be banned.    In my opinion, I would take this book and do almost the opposite it says and recommend the book, Nourishing Traditions, Sally Fallon/Mary Enig, Ph.D.   
 Yes, this book is put out by the "Research" unit for political economy, in Bombay, India.  But these folks did not do much research!  Instead, they simply ascribe the most outrageous motives to the United States any time we take action.  It is no surprise that in 1991, the United States took part in a multinational effort against Iraq in 1991.  After all, Iraq did invade Kuwait.  Now, Kuwait was hardly our ally.  In fact, Kuwait had sided with us in the United Nations less often than any other nation on Earth.  Still, the invasion by Iraq certainly provoked and merited this sort of response.  Of course, that's not the way this book puts it.  In this book, the entire liberation of Kuwait was simply an American, British, and Israeli plot!  Israel has never been able to get the United States to so much as put our embassy to that nation in Jerusalem (in the Western portion of the city, no less).  But in this book, we Americans are in a conspiracy with Israel to let Jews "colonize" what it implies is Arab land, and maybe to massively evict Arabs from this land as well.  That's not quite what is happening, of course.  The only systematic and thorough evictions we've seen have been of Jews, from Gaza.  And there may be more such evictions, of Jews, from parts of the disputed West Bank.  The authors say that it was plain to the world that Iraq was about to invade Kuwait when April Glaspie talked with Saddam Hussein shortly before the invasion.  But it seems clear to me that we Americans were genuinely surprised by the invasion.  Was it really plain to the world?  If so, to which world?  Was it really to this one, which happens to include India?  I think it is telling that the authors boast of a French plan to avoid attacking Iraq and instead have a conference at which it would be agreed that Iraq would get out of Kuwait in return for us (in effect) giving permission for Arabs to swipe some Israeli land.  Um, why would that have been a good "trade" for anyone?   There is a section about sanctions against Iraq.  These sanctions may indeed have been a dubious idea, but they were hardly deliberate genocide!  And Iraq could have avoided these sanctions by complying with the demands on it.  In addition, Iraq could have made things much easier on its population even with the sanctions in place.  It's outrageous for this book to imply that these sanctions were simply a genocidal American scam.  The authors come up with even more nonsense when they discuss Arafat, a notorious thug.  Arafat's gang of thugs is considered to be the true representatives of a whole nation, or at least of all the local Arab population.  But that's simply false.  That gang existed primarily to fight against Jewish rights in the region, and that's not the same as being genuine representatives of the Arab people and promoters of the welfare of those Arabs.  And what does the book say about the aggression of Arafat and his gang against Israel?  Oh, to the authors, it is just an Israeli trick to try to delegitimize Arafat!  Once again, I wonder which world the authors think they live in.  Does America want to be an imperialist, colonialist, and genocidal nation?  Obviously not.  In a world at peace, our nation will do extremely well.  The authors of this book ought to have considered the possibility that America's people and Congress (and even our administration) are anything but imperialist, colonialist, and genocidal.  If the authors had wanted to do some real research on our reaction to aggression, they could have.  They could have determined some standards by which to judge what we did.  And they could have pointed out when we did things pretty much properly, when we made mistakes, when we reacted too strongly, and when we reacted too mildly.  But they did nothing of the sort.  Instead, they wrote some cheap and useless anti-American propaganda 
 I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes.  M. Night Shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at Denny's 
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 B.F. is right-on about the missing diagrams.  While Kevin Loney's "Oracle 10g DBA Handbook" is excellent because it is diagram packed, "The Complete Reference" is not complete without them.  I bought Mr. Loney's DBA book and love it, but his Complete Reference was passed over.  I think it would be more marketable & useful if "The Complete Reference" were broken up into two volumes: "10g The Complete Reference: For DBA's VOL. 1" and "10g The Complete Reference: For Programmer's VOL. 2" and published in hardcover editions 
 I previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of House of Leaves, but after some thought, have decided to edit it.    House of Leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances, and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read.  One individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror.  Others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and couldn't put it down.  Now, I love a good horror story, and several people promised me that this was THE horror story to read. After suffering through long boring academic-style descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides, and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist, I failed to find the scary.  I looked and looked, but it just wasn't there.    Thus, I'm disappointed.   It isn't so much that I minded slogging through faux academic literature (although that in itself is annoying - how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project?!), but that I slogged through it looking for something that - for me, at least - just wasn't there.  So, if you want my opinion, the book isn't scary, and it's rather long and dry.  Even the supposedly frightening experiences of Johnny Truant, the tattoo artist, were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over.  Hence my previous title of "A handful of Ritalin and a pot of coffee couldn't make this readable...".    Do I really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses I only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement?  That's what it felt like 
 I tried to read this trash-book, here in Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read book about religion and history.And this is a trash-book.The core's idea of this trash-book is that, Popes were jew's enemies.   Well, even the most fanatic protestants recognizes, that there was a Pope in Rome, since at least 1,700 years ago.The RCC(Roman Catholic Church) claims that St. Peter was the first Pope in Rome an that he was living there in I Century.After at least 1,700 years, there's thousands of jews, living in Rome today.A comparation between Rome and Afghanistan( a country, bigger than France and England together, not a city) is that while there's thousand of jews in Rome, there was only two jews, in all Afghanistan in 2001.Both old, sick and poor jews.    Reading this book, we will see some "terrible" examples of anti-semithism from some Popes.In other words, because of Popes tragedies, came for all the mankind.This book is 100% biased and leads you, to absurds and bigoted conclusions.    The comparasion between Popes and famous jews, at the same times, shows without a drop of doubt, that famous jews were thousands of times worse than any Pope then living.To example, when Lenin(jew), Trotsky(jew) and a jewish-communist gang, promissed that the whole Chritianity will be soon, wiped out from the world, senteced to death tens of millions of christians in then Soviet Union.What "monster" was Pope living at that time?    Mussolini had enormous money's support from famous and rich jews.Mussolini also got power with a decrete from an excomunicated italian king.Mussolini went to eugenics movement, following bad advices from eugenicists (many of them jews) from Italy and also, from the USA.RCC was the biggest enemy of eugenics.In fact, eugenics was a jewish, protestant, marxist and feminist business.    Hitler himself got enormous amounts of money, from former USSR and famous and rich americans.The vast majority of them, were jews or deeply linked to jews.You can read a book about american money to Hitler, on the Book "Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler".The author of this excellent book is Anthony Sutton and this book is available here, in Amazon.    There's nothing showing any money's supply, from catholic church to Lenin, Mussolini or Hitler.At the same time, every serious historian, knows that famous and rich jews gave enormous amounts of money to all of these murders.    In the last century, while famous jews exterminated more than 40,000,000 faithfull catholics, not a single jew was mudered following Pope's orders.In fact regognizing the Pius XII's support to jews in Rome, the rabin of that city was coverted to the roman catholicism.The real title for this trash-book must be: The Jews Against the Popes.          
 This book is horrible.  I learned nothing.  The only points that were reasonable were those that everyone already knows.  Useless and pretentious 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 I'm a big fan of this series, but "Death Dance" is a dud.  First of all, the whodunit itself is a big "who cares?"  I'm still not sure why Talya Galinova was killed.  And the similarities to her death and the real-life murder of a Met orchestra member in the 1980s is just plain tasteless.  The whole mystery could have been set on Broadway (where most of the book takes place anyway) without detracting from the (minimal, far-fetched and uninteresting) plot.  Not to mention that Fairstein is way off in her Met Opera research:  Only twelve chandeliers rise at the beginning of each performance, not thirty-two, there are five tiers in the house, not six, and there are 92 standing room positions at the back of the orchestra, not the whopping 275 she claims.  OK, no big deal in the grand scheme of things, but very sloppy mistakes nonetheless.  One of the great things about Fairstein's other thrillers has been the New York history with which she peppers them, and "Death Dance" is no exception.  There's fascinating info about the Shriners and their legacy in NY, although the character to whom Fairstein gives this knowledge seems to exist for the sole purpose of pontificating about it.  On the plus side, the sub-plot, involving a dasterdly doctor is pretty interesting; and there's a gripping discussion between heroine Alex Cooper, and a couple of colleagues involving the application of a particular legal statute.  But none of that is enough to make "Death Dance" anything more than a long, dull waste of time and paper 
 Walking with a panther 1/2 Star  This is the worst LL Cool J album I've ever seen, I Hated it, Although I Didn't like 14 Shots to the dome, Phenomenon and The DEFintion, but those look like masterpieces compared to this junk, LL's performance is really terrible, the songs are terrible, everything about this album is really bad, Sadly LL Got backlashed and booed pretty harshly in showtime in the apollo in 1989 and what's worse NWA & Public Enemy brought a major change to rap.  Thankfully he made a comeback after this and he blew people away this time with Mama said knock you out.  This is a dreadful album, absolutely dreadful. 
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 Some how my previous review text got a little glitched up.  But suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut.  The manufacture of these knives is well below the quality I expected ....  It's the first time I;ve been TOTALLY disappointed ....  We're returning the knives because they are not worth the money.  Really, they look great in the picutre, but they are very poor quality.  Why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars 
  Ill sum it up quick, the more you talk about panic /anxiety disorder, the more you join support groups and talk about it constantly , the more you make it a part of your life , the longer it will stay and the deeper it will get into your subconscious, which will make it harder to overcome, but overcome and be completely cured you can be and its very easy ,as much hate from other suffer's ill probably insight by saying that, the problem is that these type of books are the last thing you need. search the net for a guy named Charles Linden, the get back to livin 
 The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body.  One of the few exercise videos that does this is the Firm's "Boomers." Too bad it's not available anymore

 Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling "Byzantine" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 There are only four good songs on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money 
 This book is worth reading just to get a sense of the way the American public views business today. The stories of businesses told in this book are one-sided and even irrational, but without a doubt, they reflect the way American business is seen by the public right now.  The problem with the book is that it offers very few ideas on how a business can successfully navigate today's minefield of public perception. As a reader hoping to come away with ideas on how to nurture the public's perception of my business, I instead finished the book feeling that businesses are largely at the mercy of dumb luck and circumstance when it comes to perception. Further, the author admits that businesses are in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation when attempting to let the public know about any acts of goodwill.  This book is well-timed to take advantage of today's anti-business climate, but not of much help for those seeking to find their way through it 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
   I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Just tastes bad, don't know how else to describe it. Sorry, but I couldn't even get through one bag. Oh well 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 If you're looking for a book that was mostly written by someone other than Kendra, has information about housing markets that is outdated, and overall seems like a free seminar at a cheap hotel, then this book is for you.  
 The only thing exciting about the book is the title.  I could not wait to get the book and read it.  I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever.  There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole.  I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off 
 I was not impressed with this book.  Very little technical data, no data on many of the excellent images in the book.  The writting was flowery and arty rather than concise with information to convey.  If your looking for a book to teach you something, I would not recommend this book.    John Shaw's Nature Photography book is, however, outstanding 
 This book is very complictated. One might have a chance if this book was treated as textbook and offered in a university over a semester long class, taking each chapter apart with live examples. Other reviews mention that it takes years to master this method.I somewhat agree. The rules of logic are not clear and that is mainly because if the autor wanted to go to great lenght to explain everything this book would be around 2000 to 3000 pages. So, you gonna have to figure it out on your own and that will take you a lot of time! Get an Elliot Wave Charting software you'll save yourself a lot of headache and time 
 Let me cut right to the chase, there is only really one semi-noteworthy song on this album and it's "Four Leaf Clover". I realize Winger's early works were quite pubescent and lacking substance lyrically, but the music itself did not lack substance. When Winger matured lyrically with "Pull", the band seemed to feel that the music also needed to make a shift. I think the best of both worlds would've been to maintain the great melodies and hooks inherent in Winger's early material with the lyrical substance of the bands latter works.  While I don't think "Pull" was bad musically necessarily, I think it lacked some of the really catchy hooks and melodies inherent in Winger's earlier work to some degree, however there was still a melodic thread that ran through many of the songs. If I were to rate Winger's early works as a five, I'd rate "Pull" as a 3 1/2.  With "IV", gone are most of the melodic elements that made me a Winger fan in the first place. Instead, they've been replaced with grungy / bluesy / somewhat more progressive rock elements. The levels of melodic interest seem (for me) more and more brief with each passing album, in my opinion.  The acoustic intro of "Right Up Ahead" gave me hope that the album was off to a good start, however once the song kicked in I thought, "WHAT are they doing?" It's supposed to sound hard and dark but it really sounds forced and contrived, in my opinion. However, I do like the first part of the chorus to the song.  "Blue Suede Shoes" had a promising beginning, but the chorus drags on and failed to offer the great melodic payoff I was expecting. I'm a fan of Kip Wingers solo work and feel the verses of the song would've fit well on a future solo album.  I didn't like "M16" from the get-go. It has a progressive/hard feel to it that didn't do a thing for me. Filler.  "Your Great Escape" is up-tempo party rock, in my opinion. The chorus has a slight melodic element to it but it definitely doesn't save the song for me. Filler.  Then we get to another, what I consider, contrived darker song called "Disappear". There's a brief melodic reprieve when the pre-chorus comes in but the chorus really doesn't do anything for me. This strikes me as one of those songs that's supposed to draw in modern rock fans, but in my opinion this song wouldn't serve such a purpose.  I do think "On A Day Like Today" would've made a great addition to a Kip Winger solo album. It's somewhat haunting and has a good feel early on. I think the chorus could've been a bit stronger, what with the haunting first half. This isn't filler but I don't think it's strong enough melodically to fit on a Winger album either.  I don't know what the band was doing with "Living Just To Die". It seems they were going for a somewhat semi-dark, dirty rock feel but I don't care for it. It strikes me as another contrivance. It's not a style I care for at all. Filler.  I found more of the same in the track "Short Flight To Mexico" -- dirty rock that tries to be serious. It doesn't work for me. The beginning wants to sound new and dark to some degree but it just comes across as misdirected, in my opinion. Filler.  Another downtuned modern rock effort can be heard in "Generica". I wish someone would tell Kip Winger the downtuned modern rock thing doesn't work at all for him. It comes across as sounding superficial and uninspired. It might work for Saliva or 3 Days Grace but it just doesn't cut it at all for Winger, in my opinion. This is one of those songs that does offer a melodic digression about halfway through the song which lasts for, I'd say, a good minute and a half. I think it's good (albeit somewhat repetitive) although Kip Winger doesn't really take it anywhere. Overall, I'd have to rank this song as somewhat of a filler.  "Can't Take It Back" isn't what I'd expect from the Winger of old but it isn't necessarily filler per se, in my opinion. This song strikes me as a downtuned semi-rock ballad with harder elements thrown in to make it darker than it would be otherwise. Not what I'd prefer but it's listenable, in my opinion. If "Four Leaf Clover" was a steak, this song would probably be the potatoes.  There's just so much that doesn't move me about this effort. If Kip Winger wants to move the band in a more modern rock direction, that's fine, but please make it modern "melodic" rock, not downtuned grunge / dirty rock that tries to be hard and dark 
 I can't really recommend this book. Like many non-fiction books it's very repititious and doesn't really offer insight. Never quite gets to the crux of the matter. He puts together very complex charts for simple concepts  that did nothing but fill pages. I found the techniques so commonplace as  to not be useful 
 This film comes after THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974).  THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) is the third Bond film for Roger Moore and the 10th film in the "James Bond" series.   Bernard Lee returns as "M", Lois Maxwell returns as "Miss Moneypenny", Desmond Llewelyn returns as "Q".  Walter Gotell who appeared in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963) returns as a new character "General Gobel", a role he would play until 1987.  He was also the voice of "General Gobel" in the cartoon, "James Bond Jr" (1991-92).   A Russian submarine has been downed.  Agent XXX is called upon by general Gobel (Walter Gotell), however Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) is in bed with Agent Sergei Borzov (Michael Billington).  James Bond (Roger Moore) is also called on duty and he too is in bed with a woman.  Well off he goes and the woman is working for the other side.  Bond needs his skis to get out of this one.  (Best breath-taking stunt ever filmed, uncut).  Bond has an opponent to find, Stromberg (Curt Jurgens), who likes sharks and feeds his betraying agents to them.  His helper is "Jaws", a giant human (Richard Kiel, EEGAH! [1963].   This film will take you to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx in Egypt.  Geoffrey Keen played "Fredrick Gray", the Minister of Defense.   Robert Brown played "Admiral Hargreaves".  He would later play "M" in 1983-89.   Assistant Director, Victor Tourjansky is the man on the beach drinking wine.  he also appears in MOONRAKER (1979) and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981).   Although the end of this film mentioned James Bond would return in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, that movie project was put on hold until 1981.   The next movie filmed actually is: MOONRAKER (1979).   A new 007 Studio was built so sets could be built at a great scale including holding the submarines.    DVD Special Features: "Inside The Spy Who Loved Me" 41-minute documentary.   "Ken Adam: Designing Bond", 22-minute documentary about the production designer.   3 movie trailers, 6 television spots, 12 radio spots for "The Spy Who Loved Me".

 Nancy helps Mr. Drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building.  The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck.  Ooooooh!  That's so scary.  Yawwwwwwn.  This book is absolutely horrible.  The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery.  It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals.  When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people.  Lots of suspense there.  This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants.  This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 Adler must be given his due for making philosophy more accessible to the average, non-professional reader. He deliberately tackles six classical ideas and gives reasons for their importance. For the non-specialist, these six essays may provoke interesting discussion and dialectic, or perhaps starting points for further inquiry.  Such topics as beauty, truth, justice, etc. often have been lost in philosophy for the narrower, Anglo-American analysis of propositional logic. That doesn't means Adler's ideas are useless or less interesting, but they aren't the type of topics one encounters in most academic philosophy departments, for good or ill.  Of all Adler's books, this is far my least favorite. It concerns itself with essences, something that has given way to Wittgenstein's "family of resemblances." Talking about "essences" is antediluvian, unless, like Adler, you're an Aristotlean. Reading about such abstract concepts -- the six great ideas, is rather like talking about "red" with someone. There's not much one can really do or say about "red," except to point out examples. I'm afraid that Adler has boxed himself into a corner by pursuing such absract concepts like "liberty" as if it were any different than "red."  It's not that I oppose Adler's good intentions; I really wish his kind of philosophy was more visible, tackling some of these important concepts in an intellectually rigorous manner. But ambiguity raises its ugly head, and the student of philosophy is left bereft of very important philosophical concepts.   Tackling enormous concepts without intellectual rigor seems rather useless and pointless. Thus, two stars for effort, but really no stars for success. Yet, if one really wants a place to start his or her inquiry, this little book may be of singular importance 
 I expected more information as to dates and specific predictions for the current time period.  The book was very vague and seemed to be missing much.  I would not suggest this book for reading 
 I love Pete Hamill and was looking forward to reading another of his stories about New York at Christmas time.  This was a major disappointment 
 I couldn't finish this book, and usually I finish books too quickly.  The reviewer who described her book/writing style as tedious wins the prize from me.  I think I would have liked her piece if she wrote differently.  But.. 
 Waste of money... This book is good only for school projects and absolutely not useful for artists, restorers or woodworkers. Very amateur...Featuring stone age techniques, which can only discourage the follower. Don't give any choice of supplies, don't warn about possible mistakes an failures during the process and do not say how to avoid or fix those mistakes.  Anyway... Following this book amateur will only get frustrated: Spend a fortune for supplies and sabotage there treasures... Professionals or semi-professionals - simply don't need it... Businesses  which  selling supplies and gold leaf  offer a seminars and comprehensive guides "how to" for gold leafing. Much more useful... About restoration - still searching for good info... 
 ok, you can stop being intrigued by the whole "produced by a monk from bhutan" marketing scheme.. the main character has  absolutely no depth or personality and the screenplay is painfully shallow and predictable.. im embarrassed for whoever is involved with and responsible for this release.  watch the motorcycle diaries instead for some actual character development, an involving storyline and a REAL glimpse into your soul. 
 Yes, she was Lennon's half-sister. It was necessary for to put a family tree in the back of the book to show how she was related to him. When I bought this book I was hoping for a lot of detail about the early years of John Lennon. There were very few surprises. Take a look at the dust cover of the book.  It is as though she is trying to look like Lennon with her wire-rimmed specs. And you would have expected many more photos of John with the family from someone claiming to be so close. Save your money.  
 Tried this in all my Emerilware Stainless Pans and it won't fit any of them.  I had to send it back 
 How do Michaelson's books keep getting 5 stars? Does he get all of his friends to rate his lame books as soon as he publishes them? This book was great the first time I read it -- when it was called "Sun Tzu for Business."  Please stop buying his books, so he'll go away.  Thanks 
 The dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea.  The only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself.  I wish the case closed more tightly, it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily.  Overall tho, aside from the annoyance of the lid, for the price it was still worth purchasing because as I've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection. 
 FALSEHOODS. Spong's most important falsehood is the book's nominal premise--its title. Christianity won't die if it doesn't change. Religions can remain static, or change minimally, and remain viable for millennia. Islam in particular comes to mind.  Relatedly, the theistic God has not been "cast aside" because human beings have "evolved" (p 54). Positing that humans can/do/will evolve either physically or mentally in the space of a few years is an error made by many, including Marx, Lenin, Lysenko and Hegel. Theism developed due to human nature (pp 51-52), and Spong shows no evidence that the mere acquisition of knowledge changes our nature.  INTOLERANCE. For a guy who seeking to "love wastefully and abundantly," (p 68) Spong has a hell of a long way to go. He commits an unpardonable hypocrisy when he calls his critics peddlers of "premodern literalizations that so frequently masquerade as Christianity" (p xvi). Besides being intolerance bordering on bigotry, wouldn't you agree that Spong calling others' Christian credentials into question is a little ironic?  SOPHISTRY. Why does Spong resist being called a pantheist or even a "panentheist" (p 62)? Is there really any difference between "God is in, but not necessarily the sum of, all things" (panenetheism) and "God is the inescapable depth and center of all that is" (Spongism) (p 70)?  And...Christianity without Christ. Think about that. Sam Kinison would have correctly pointed out that Christianity without Christ is like rock 'n roll without drugs. Spong's Jesus is not Christ. He is a "spirit person" (ch 7). He doesn't save (pp 179-180). He didn't atone (p 84). He will not resurrect us (p 116). I could believe an oak tree is Christ; does that make me a Christian?   CASUISTRY. Spong's phony reasoning is obvious when contrasting his religious and political views. Take a look at his view of Jesus and his favorable view of abortion (p 6). In chapter 8 Spong sets forth Jesus as the alpha-exemplar of selflessness and defender of the defenseless and excluded (pp 128-9). Contrast that ideal with abortion. Abortion is almost always selfish; actually, it's difficult to think of something more selfish. It also is an act that by definition rejects (kills) the defenseless.  TRUTH. Let's be honest. Spong breaks wide open some of Christianity's most glaring problems and fallacies. Among the best explained are: how the Enlightenment and modern science attack God (pp 31-40); how the need for religion comes from our nature instead of an external source (pp 51-52); the illogic of "religious truth" (p 52); the function of guilt as part of religious control (p 95); the inherent injustice of prayer (p 142); the immorality of the law of Moses (p 153); and the contemporary selective obedience to biblical laws (pp 156-158) 
 Requirements for buying this album:  Poor decision making skills, nothing is ever your fault, your genetic destiny is to become a broke and miserable unwed parent with 2 failed marriages before age 30 or your parents took the car keys away because you got a bad report card which makes you want to fantasize fake suicide in your bedroom by landing on top of your Playstation where your cell phone breaks your hip...then yeah, get this album.  Also, you "memorial tattoo" trailer park/apartment complex living mouth breathers might like this one after you've digested Godsmack's first CD 900 times since it's release might want to pick this up as well.  Now...if your mother has crispy 80's hair and goes to tanning beds where your stepsister lives in your basement with her boyfriend and their 2 year old son who wears baby sized basketball jerseys, then Hybrid Theory is a MUST for your collection.  Goes right next to Toby Keith's Shock N Ya'll and the latest from P. Diddy in your assembly-required-particle-board CD storage.  
 These girls suck! They've just redone other ppls songs! The lead girl cant even sing. IF YOU LIKE THESE PEOPLE LISTEN TO "THE VERONICAS" Everlife ripped off 1 of there songs, "I could get used to this". Im not joking "The veronicas" are the best music sister team in the industry. And they've ripped off lillix's song What I like Thats bull.  These girls have no talent! They just rip off other peoples song and do it worse then the original singers! 
 I Have read two books by Rob Thomas, "Rats Saw God" and "Slave Day".  Because I Read the former of the two books, "Rats Saw God" first, I assumed that Thomas was a fairly good novelist.  NOT SO!!  Slave Day follows the lives of several different high school students and one high school teacher over the course of one day.  The book piles too many subplots into too little a writting space.  In one plot, a supposed "rebel" deals with an evil teacher.  In another, a nerd does all he can to impress the "hottie" of the school.  The book's content was very depressing, and the ending was FAR TO ABRUPT.  When rating this item, I seriously considered giving it a "3" because it does have its good points.  Unfortunatley, the good points do not outshine its bad points 
 The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something 
 I am new to web design but am pretty good with computers.  I have been producing and editing music for fun for years.  This book is dicey at best.  There are good points, but overall it is hard to follow and gives a poor explaination of Dreamweaver's features.  Hopefully, the author is better in the classroom than she is in this text or I feel sorry for her students 
 Gaggia used to be the cat's meow in espresso. They have lost the bubble in the last ten years. Many other machines do more, are easier to use, and produce better cups in an easier manner. i still have my old Gaggia, but now rely on a Saeko in my home. The difference is obvious 
 This movie is beyond horrible - cant believe this is the same gang of super troopoers - this is exactly what it is.  A campy movie that looks like college kids had some free time on their hands.  Buy 2 copies of Super Troopers - and wait for TBS to air this about 4 am in 5 years 
 The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 This is probably the worst textbook that I have used in the past two years.  The book makes a lot of basic concepts seem very difficult and a lacks the proper examples to even explain what the problems at the end of the chapter are asking.  The wording is very boring and tends to put the reader to sleep- making the poor explanation of concepts even worse.  The authors jump around and often fail to define terms or use them before they are explained.  The index has proved to be worthless in many of these instances.  There are a lot of problems that I do not believe could be solved by a new edition 
 I am a huge fan of Carlos, and have been for years. Ever since the release of 'Take a Joke, America', I have eagerly awaited the next album. So, imagine my joy when I saw this album.I was disappointed.   Usually, Carlos' comedy is peppered with bits of Spanish, mostly well-known words or stuff you can figure out. This album, I'd say about half of the album is in full Spanish. And it's mostly the punchlines to his jokes. He sets them up in English and then goes into Spanish, with no explanation.   There's nothing on the CD to denote that large portions of the contents are in Spanish, so there was no warning of this. Not even so much as an SAP button.  If you don't already have it, grab 'Take a Joke, America'. It's a great album from one of the funniest men of our time. But not this album.   
 Really, Tom.  Leave your religion out of it.  Religion doesn't mix well with sophisticated philosophy 
 I have read and loved this story since a young girl, I recently decided to purchase my own copy and went with the "Digi---" version because it was the least expensive.  The amazon website says nothing about this being an abbridged book, but it is.  I thought I was just mis-remembering my previous dozen readings of the tale, but a passage at the very end revealed that it was not my imagination- this is a cut work.  I was already displeased with my purchase because there are dozens of typos, transposed words, and even blatant butchering of a Ms. Annabel Bliss' name into an unreadable first name and the last name "Blish".  Now that I know it is abridged I am determined to return the item for a true copy and call Amazon to suggest that they not sell abridged (and sloppy butchered) versions without proper disclosure.       By all means, order this delightful story but do not order the  "Digi---" version (with a plain purple cover), spring for extra money to get a reliable version, the Puffin or "Original Publisher" versions should be better.  Good luck = 
 I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.  It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.    Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.   Gee, what a lovely sofa.. 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 This letter is a summary of my experience with PlanOn for the past 6 months.  It all began innocent enough, I saw an article about the Docupen, and saw immediate possibilities for potential use.  Over the summer of 2006 I was going to order the DocuPen 800 Pro, for I was going to have great use in my teaching environment with Worcester State College as well as Becker College, both located in Worcester, Massachusetts.  From a technological perspective, I was intrigued, so began my research of trying to learn more of the product.  I searched the web for reviews, personal opinions, etc... and well all in all, things seemed positive minus the software interface and the fact the system shuts off after EVERY one page scan.   Anyway, in early August I decided to order a Docupen, even though on the website it said orders were taking 2-3 weeks to fill.  I called sales, and was told that do to manufacturing delays, it was going to be closure to 4 weeks for fulfillment or I could just call back in September when the Docupens are to be in.    I placed my order on September 15, 2006 for a DocuPen Rc800 Pro, standard color $349.00 order number:XXXX.  Now all I had to do was wait.  Two weeks went by and no word from PlanOn in regards to the status from my order.  Now school has been in session for a week now, but that is ok.  When I called, I am told that the shipment didn't arrive do to manufacturing difficulties.  At this point, I am willing to believe customer service.  Two more weeks go by and still not response from customer service about the status of my shipment.  I attempt to call the 1-888-507-3926 and keep getting the answering service.   I tried on-line chat-support, only to find out that an order that was suppose to take 2-3 weeks, is now going to take 6-8 weeks.  The kind lady from customer service offered me a carrying case for the scanner when it arrives.  I really didn't care about any carrying case, I just wanted up front honesty about where the heck my scanner was and when was it going to be delivered.  3 months go by and finally, the Docupen scanner arrives, was it worth the wait, NO!  In total, the delivery time took over 3 months.  In such time I was able to find another product that better met my needs for the purpose of scanning documents.  Even though I had decided to purchase another product, I was still looking forward to using my PlanOn DocuPen.  All I have to say is that I was sorely disappointed at the scan quality, the poor software options and overall experience for PlanOn.  So with no hesitation, I requested to return my DocuPen under the 30-day money back guarantee.  Was that to be the end of my frustrations with PlanOn, NO!  Here is a time line of various correspondences in the attempts to get an RMA and refund issued.  December 4, 2006 - initial request for an RMA December 4, 2006 - I receive standard RMA procedure December 4, 2006 - All required questions from RMA questionnaire have been answered and emailed back December 11, 2006 - receive RMA sheet December 12, 2006 - send back Docupen according to PlanOn specifications with tracking # and signature confirmation, emailed RMA department to inform of status December 14, 2006 - receive email from RMA rep saying that they will be looking out for the package December 18, 2006 - receive email verification (from Post Office) of signature confirmation January 8, 2007 - I email RMA rep to find out status January 14, 2007 - I email RMA rep again to find out status January 18, 2007 - I receive an email from the RMA rep informing me that the package had indeed arrived, and that the credit would be issued in 5 days January 25, 2007 - I still have not received any verification or communication that my credit is being processed January 29, 2007 - I call PlanOn and have the following conversations "called PlanOn today (1/29/07) I spoke with a Harmony from customer service.  I was told that April McKnight is the credit manager.  Apparently the credit manager has been out of the office for the past week.  Though that doesn't explain the email from Nick on 1/18/07 explain that the credit will be issued in 5 days.  Here over two weeks after that email, apparently the credit is still sitting on April's desk.  I was told by Harmony that it will be taken care of this week."  So I have been more than patient in regards to waiting for reply and follow up from anyone from PlanOn.  Every time I contacted someone about the request for an RMA, I was the one that had to follow up (4 times) before receiving a reply to my request.  I have now emailed three times in regards to receipt of my returned docupen.     Needless to say, I find the product not worth the time or the money.  The company has  miserable customer service.  But I should have been aware of this when I first placed my order and was told it would take 2 weeks and it arrived 3 months later, and the product was a piece of junk 
 The scale is everything the manufacturer claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components. I suspect that poor Q&A will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing on it...).   Conclusions: * Scale design is nice--looks good. * Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very strong.  Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is rather poor. * Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies. * Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections.  Hope this helps! 
 i wanted to buy "you the users guide" and perhaps i clicked the wrong one but that is what i was searching for and the covers are similar . did not check the confirmation properly because did not realise author had two books with the the " you " in bold type . the book  is useless to me but is probably my fault " buyer beware " thankyou 
 _State and Revolution_ is a complicated book in the annals of Marxist thinking. Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's "Revolution Betrayed" 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I found the book repetitive and boring.  We were told many things over and over again.  And the set up for the romance with the Reverand is nothing if not ridiculous.  Not interested in reading any more of these for sure.  
 That's right, what would you do if you had all the money in the world? Well Quentin Stowe has that exact problem. If a leprechaun said you could have three wishes and suddenly you only had one, would you pick that? It  may sound like a very good wish, but soon Quentin learns that all that  gold, green and silver in his backyard costs him the loss of friendship,  angry townspeople, and so much more. I was excited to read this book by the  description on the back. It seemed very interesting, but I was very  disappointed with the plot. Quentin couldn't give any of his money away, or  spend it. It stayed in his yard. I would recommend this book to people who  like very unrealistic stories, and enjoy books you can breeze through.  However, I still think those people would get bored in some of the  chapters 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 I bought this unit and was excited to see how it performed.  It turned on and acquired the satellites within 10 minitues initially, all ok.  I spent the next 4 days trying to get it to work with my computer.  After several emails and phone conversations, Garmin finally told me the deal.  No Garmin unit is designed to work with Windows XP Media Edition.  Additionally, their USB connection will only work if the USB chips are Intel. The following chips will definitely not work: ALI, NEC,or VIA.  I am not happy with Garmin.  They could have saved me a lot of grief by stating this in their advertisements or home page technical FAQs 
 I can't help but wonder where the proceeds of this book are going. Does this book help any of the 17 victims of dahmer or just line the pockets of a man who claims to be a man of God? This is simply another book of a long list of others where the author is exploiting his relatively brief contact with dahmer. While Ratcliff spares the reader the most gruesome details of dahmer's crimes it none-the-less adds insult to injury that Ratcliff is profiteering from the pain and misery of this monsters victims. One needs to remember that without these 17 victims Ratcliff has no book. So, again I ask, how is this book helping the victims of dahmers evil acts? While dahmer MAY be saved, and the very thought disgusts me personally, it is Ratcliff himself that needs to do some real soul searching on his motives for writing this perverse "book" and seek repentence for himself when he realizes he is nothing more than a profiteer 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman 
 I bought this for me, but the size ran small and it is not of a very good weight.  I have a daughter that they did fit and she wanted to wear them under things so she became the proud owner.  The shirts are not by any means high or even good quality 
 I'm beginning to think I must have read a different book than everyone else. I'm not sure how anyone could give this book any kind of rave reviews. I've read some wretched literary endeavors in my time and this certainly ranks up there with the worst. Reading it was like trudging up a mountain through hundreds of feet of snow. By Chapter 4 I was ready to weep with boredom. The dialogue is hideously written. Honestly, my 6 year old could come up with more imaginative conversations than E. Lynn Harris. My money could certainly have been spent better elsewhere 
 I ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what I already knew from personal experience; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe. An emergent property that some call `the spirit that moves through all things' and some call `god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science. Typically I pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore. The best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire. If I could I would give it a negative rating -- don't pollute your mind with this trash 
 The nature/nurture debate has been raging since the beginning of Psychology research (and indeed before) and the body of literature on the subject can support both views.  Most experts agree, however, that is MUST be a combination of both nature AND nurture.  This book completely dismisses the notion that parents have lasting influence on their child's long-term development saying instead that peers are the shaping influence.  As both a youth worker and a graduate student, I have seen first hand through academic literature and experience the importance of parents in the development of their children.  To completely reject the notion that they affect their children's long-term development is simply impossible.  Think of yourself as a thirteen-year-old; which would hurt you more:  a slap on the face from your best friend or your parent?  Another important fact to consider is the fact that Harris is not a PhD, not a recognized expert in the field, and not a member of the American Psychological Association.  In other words, she is not in good standing with her psychologist peers.  True, she has been published in both book and journal mediums, but if someone is to dismiss a major claim in the field of Psychology it should be an expert.  Having read the book, I find it to be an easy read and interesting.  I worry that parents will read this book and abandon their children emotionally because the book says they have no lasting impact.  This book cannot be used as an excuse for poor parenting- if so, this generation is in deep trouble.    I encourage readers to also examine the books Hurt (Chap Clark, 2005), A Secure Base (John Bowlby, 1990), and Raising Cain (Kindlon & Thompson, 2000) 
  Do you want to hear great tunes by Peter Frampton?  Do You Want ROCK ? Then don't buy this cd.  Purchase ' Frampton Comes Alive ' You won't regret it!  Unless you purchase this cd of course 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This book was one of the cheesiest books I've ever read.  I actually had to force myself to finish it.  The main character (Ned) in this book seemed to experience everything.. he was frends with Harvey Milk, he was in riots, friends with a porn star, went to the first Beetles concert, saw Sylvester in concert, he was in Vietnam, etc, etc, etc.  Somehow he was every gay event except Studio 54!  It was written terribly, plots were totally contrived and loosely thrown together.  Every time the character moved his residence, I had to think of what gay event the author wanted to cram in the storyline and pretend his character participated.  No true feeling to the book, I couldn't identify with the main character... I can't believe anyone liked this book! Terrible, just terrible 
 Once again Wiesel completes another masterly, tear-jerking hoax. How much longer can this phoney get away with it 
 I bought this book prior to seeing an attorney to set up a will/trust so that I would be reasonably knowledgeable about the issues to consider before the meter started running.  In particular, I, like many others have much of my net worth in IRAs and other tax advantaged retirement accounts and was concerned about how best to pass on these accounts.  To my utter astonishment (and disgust), this book for all practical purposes provides no help with IRAs, 401Ks, etc.  For heavens sake, after a home, retirement accounts are the major assets of most people and an estate planning book of 443 pages ought to be able to squeeze in basic advice on this topic.  Actually, I'm exagerating; they do provide two pieces of advice on IRAs. Their advice on page 179 is to buy a separate book from Nolo Press (whose title I will NOT cite) and on page 181 they suggest you download publications 560 and 590 from the IRS.  Gee thanks.  You don't suppose they intentionally omitted retirement accounts so you'd have to buy another one of their publications?  Could I be getting cynical in my old age?  If you don't have IRAs this book is pretty good (reason for two stars), otherwise you 're flying blind 
 Juana La Loca and her obsessive love for her husband Price Phillip is one of history's more fascinating chapters. Juana apparently refused to be separated from her husband's dead body. She was eventually imprisoned as mad, although it's unclear whether she was simply extremely passionate (...), somewhat neurotic, or actually truly mentally ill. Director Vincente Aranda opts for the first theory. Juana (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) is tremulous and doe-eyed -- when she meets her fiance Prince Philip (Daniele Lioti) the two are so overcome with passion they demand to be married on the spot. Philip then carries Juana off to the bedroom, and from then on (according to the movie) Juana is a slave to her rakish husband. She wants to have sex constantly. Of course Philip's a jerk, and loses interest, and Juana goes mad. There is really only one way to make a kind of movie like this, and that's as an unabashedly enjoyable bodice ripper. The dvd headliners seem to play up this aspect: "Sex so hot the ladies in waiting eavesdrop!" Unfortunately, Aranda is actually quite prudish. He seems to think that this movie is really an impassioned feminist film about how passionate women are punished. Perhaps for this reason, we never actually see Juana and Philip have sex. Thus, Juana's sexual obsession is less palpable for the viewer. The movie also pays some lip service to the political machinations surrounding Juana. Ultimatley, Mad Love loses steam. Part of the problem is the casting of Lioti -- he looks like Fabio, but really cant act. And Philip is such a murkily written character -- is he simply a cad? A Machiavellian monarch? Like many historical dramas the movie is shot in long, uninterrupted takes and a rather still camera. It is never sunny, and no one ever smiles it seems. It's not bad for a film to play fast and loose with history. Juana la Loca's story is ambiguous enough that it can afford some modern revisionism. But for a film that wants to be a bodice ripper, a compelling costume drama, and a feminist statement, ultimately the movie ends up being none of these things. A disappointment 
 My review is basically a review of the reviewers. In particular I am going to pick on the reviewer who wrote "A substantial and objective view of a Latin American Legend..." February 9, 2004, Matthew Dubuque. Because of that review I decided not to buy the book. (I haven't read it but based on the reviews I've changed my mind about purchasing it). Most reviews listed here whether critical of Castro or critical of his deriders, have really missed the point. It's all about ignorance.   Centralized Power What many fail to see is the problem of centralized power found exclusively in the hands of the State. How many times have we heard about how even if Hitler was bad, he had the trains running on time and brought back an economy from the ruins? God forbid something good should happen in a person's life and the government doesn't get credit for it. The friends of Liberty are few indeed. Cuba, at least in our Hemisphere is an example of centralized power destroying life and lying about its success even if it is successfully argued that the individual should take a back seat to the communal good.   Politicians If in fact a "conservative" "appointee of Margaret Thatcher" wrote this book it betrays that even the Hawks like the right in the UK and US are way off when it comes to Cuba. If it was "written by an appointee of the free-market heroine Margaret Thatcher" that gives credence to the view that there isn't much difference between political conservatives and modern political liberals: they go about arguing for different roles government should have in a person's life but they both want government in a person's life. They aren't too far from the likes of Castro.  Castro and Latin America To say Castro is deserving of praise like that given to Simon Bolivar shows how much ignorance there is of Latin America in the United States. The common view here is that all Latin Americans are either lazy, deserve their governments, come from naturally corrupt countries, and can only be saved by the strong man. It is interesting that those who hold similar views in the States don't prescribe such a government in their own hometowns- different rules for special people, I guess.  Further proof of the mass ignorance in the States about Cuba in particular is seen in the reviewer's statement: "Coming from a decisively Thatcherite background, the author's commentary is neither distorted by the hysterical whiners in Miami nor is it merely pinko propaganda." I can assure you that the Miami whiners are anything but: many have recreated their lives as Americans never to return to Cuba (without any major complaint), never involving themselves in politics or in some cases holding very liberal and pro-government views. Those who have complained and taken action (such as attempting to overthrow the Castro regime) the US has dealt with forcefully. Many of those active whiners now serve life terms in Federal prison for their actions (so much for the US's claim that it fights for the freedom of the oppressed worldwide).  The other more peaceful "whiners" in Miami have reasons to protest. Their family members have been: shot by firing squad, drowned by Cuban coast guard, attacked by US coast guard, tortured in Castro's prisons, divided by both the US and Cuban governments, and so on.  Another point of ignorance is the claim that Fidel lost many of his men by massacre during the revolution. This is not the case. The real major bloodletting took place once Castro came to power. Typical of all tyrants, he purged many of his own clan accusing them of conspiring against the revolution (challenging his power, reasoning and/or techniques). Plus, the vast majority of Cuba had no idea who Fidel Castro was. Castro merely appeared stage left, made his entrance and delivered the speeches. The "revolution" against Batista and Cuba's past was largely an action of the political class (those already in power) which of course Castro was not a part of.   Literacy  Literacy rates never are guaranteed by the government. In Cuba there is no way to cross examine the claims of government as the press does in a free society- such as questioning the claims of a government that states another country had a weapons of mass destruction. Just look at the US. Its literacy rates were highest in the world up until after the Civil War. Decade after decade its own government has kept records showing that the more government involves itself in the education of its citizens (increased spending) the greater the illiteracy (at least since the 1950s). Most students here today cannot even point out their country on a map and know very little about economics (a greater reason for their willingness to depend on government and hate the rich).   Blockade? The blockade is another point of contention. The word blockade first of all is a malapropism. There are no war ships blocking the ports of Havana. The embargo against Cuba is a joke. The first supporter of Cuba is Washington. The relationship between Havana and Washington is more that of two former lovers who criticize (directly and indirectly) one another's current lifestyles and actions- calling each other names but also ready to stop the actions of outsiders to the relationship lest it create the impression that the outsider has a stake in the former lovers' relationship- than the relationship of two archenemies. If you don't believe me, take a look at Washington's willingness for regime changes all over the world, its reluctance to take action against Cuba or allow others (the outsiders of the relationship) to take that action and its cozy relationship with Cuban military along Guantanamo base/border.  Prenatal Care, medicine, and homelessness If a mother misses a visit to her doctor in Cuba I wouldn't doubt the doctor visits the mother the next day. Undoubtedly since the State is ever present in such a system in every person's life, either the doctor or the mother have a political role in that relationship. And if either fails the State (list Castro here) the State will most assuredly fail them in respective their natural liberty (prison awaits). I doubt that mother would care about doc's visit knowing that the visiting doctor lacks supplies. (I know, its Castro's fault or the embargo's fault. Why can't it be the people's fault? When will they rebel?) This is nonetheless the case even in the US. Soon we will see our dear friend the Nanny Government knocking on the doors of all poor neighborhoods making sure that mothers get their prenatal care they deservedly need for the nurturing of future robots (I'm sorry, I meant to say patriotic citizens). Keep in mind that the medical doctor in the US is in fact an agent of the government. Try getting some medicines you need without a prescription. Said medicines are approved by the government, tested by the government and monitored by the government.   I am also certain that in Cuba there are no homeless because, well, there are no homes to be homeless from. Take a look at photos today of Havana and you'll see why some Cubans might want to be homeless than to live under the roof of a soon to be condemned structure.   After reading this book and writing all the things Dubuque wrote it is hard to believe that one can honestly state that the book is a "balanced examination...".. The reviewer also goes on to say that he goes to the island twice yearly on licensed visits. (Governments love to help one another regardless of their official declarations concerning one another.) The reviewer explicitly states how government supports his trips to Cuba which in turn create his view of Cuba. He states that his visits are "fully authorized", no doubt, with the Treasury department's rubber stamp, Havana's offering of tourist traps and his safe flight back to the US, causing his rose colored lenses to sit firmly on the bridge of his nose as he tells us what he has seen in Cuba 
 This shows all the hallmarks of another rigging of the review process by shameless spruiker Brad Sugars.  Notice all 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed books by B.S. and .... low and behold they all recieve 5 stars, and most are thinly disguised promotions complete with embellished statements of the undoubted and profound effects it's purchase will have on your business, imploring you to buy it, complete with exclamation marks!  B.S. started Action International Business Coaching, with 700+ franchise holders, it seems to me a portion of those are working overtime through review writing to ingratiate themselves with "The Boss".  I don't doubt Mr B.S. has probably done some admirable things, but the two books of his that I made the mistake of purchasing (Instant Cashflow and Real Estate Riches) were the text equivalent of "Vaporware" with little beneficial content and many tired cliches.  So to summarise, boo to you Mr B.S., living proof that Snake Oil Salesmen never die, they just change industries, you've reached a new low.. 
 Well, this book is filled with lots of interesting stories, but it's so disorganized it seems like it was written by an Jazz age drunk!  Better editing would have done wonders for this book which has great stories about some of the celebrities of the 1920's, but flows sloppily from one anecdote to another 
 Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey 
 In general this is an informative book of ideas IF you are planning on a very hi-tech / upper-class / expensive restaurant. Definately not for the small business entrepreneur wishing to gather ideas for a small intimate casual gathering place 
 America in NOT a democracy.    Why would you title a book this way unless you were a proponent of a democracy.  If there is anyone that wants to know the difference between a constitutional republic and a democracy, they should seek other methods.  Benjamin Franklin was asked by a group of people as he left the close of the Constitutional Convention in 1787.... "Doctor, what type of government did the delegates give us?"     Franklin responded:  "A republic, if you can keep it."  It is no wonder we are in the state we are today.  The students aren't even being convinced to learn what a republic is!  They are told to study books that advocate democracy.  
 Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.  i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.   and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.   acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.  story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go "yeah lets move there" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.  this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book 
 Overemphasis on sexual material.  Would not have bought the book had I known this. Believe Amazon "missed the boat" in recommending it to the general public.  I am very disappointed 
 "You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.  
 Be warned!  This book is not about science!  I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!  
 Am I the only person on the planet that thinks Rent is garbage? Saw it at the National Theater and had a hard time sitting through it. The music is pop bubble gum nonsense. I think it never would have become a hit had Larson not died the week of it's opening. 
 If you'd like to enter Dennett's Fantasy Land of self-satisfied, materialist reduction then this is the book for you.  If, however, you're looking for a work by a philosopher who can critically examine and defend his own theories and presuppositions then this book will probably strike you as a monumental waste of time.  To be sure, Dennett knows how to construct arguments -- the problem is that they're question-begging arguments.  And unless you share Dennett's materialist presuppostions you're going to find almost every page of this book filled with question-begging naivet.  Dennett, of course, has his reasons.  He claims that Cartesian Mind-Body dualism leads to unsolvable problems, hence we should resolve such dualism in favor of the tanglible Body and think like good (that is, consistent) materialists.  (And never mind philosophy prior to Descartes -- especially Aristotle, for whom the word "body" necessarily implies an informing and organizing "soul" or "form".  Such a "form" is, in Aristotle's account, precisely the reason why bodies are organized and not simply inchoate matter.  But never mind all that.  Dennett isn't really interested in the history of philosophy, the meanings of words, or an opponent that isn't a straw-man.)  But, despite Dennett's insistence on materialist consistency, the book is plagued by an inconsistent double-think which brings back the Mind-Body problem in its full force.  We have (or seem to have) immediate experience of our own minds or consciousness.  Dennett encourages us to reductively translate such experiences into neural processes.  The problem is, that we have experiences without being directly aware of the neural processes that are correlated to them.  That is, what we experience is not a neural process.  We infer the neural process and assume its correlation to what we experience.  Hence, the correlation of a particular neural process to a particular experience is purely speculative or hypothetical -- or at least it's speculative and hypothetical when Dennett doesn't simply present such correlation as a dogmatic belief.  Such dubious correlation calls into question the validity of the Mind's reduction to (or "translation" into) the Body.  If such translation is purely hypothetical or speculative, then Dennett hasn't moved one step beyond Mind-Body dualism (his materialist rhetoric notwithstanding).  Or put it this way.  I have an experience.  Someone may use MRI to try to determine what neural processes occur during my experience.  That person is not going to know the contents of my experience (or mind).  For that, he or she needs to rely on my own immediate or immanent account of my experience.  In other words, the observer of my neural processes simply grafts my own immanent account of consciousness onto those neural processes and assumes their correlation.  Dennett apparently fails to see that such a procedure assumes the immanent validity of a Mind's immediate self-experience (contra materialism) and that he himself relies on this assumption in order to attribute significance to the observed neural processes.    Basically, Dennett tells us that ordinary ideas about the mind or consciousness are naive.  He then proposes to replace our supposedly mistaken ideas with his own naive and question-begging ideas about Mind-Body correlation.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with this book 
 I think the director needs prozac to direct this movie, the whole plot is so mess up, junior high student can write better story than this..what was he thinking. don't waste your money buying this movi 
 I'm shipping this book back.  It isn't worth the price tag given the info it provides.  It is basically a regurjitation of pubmed.com research and abstracts.  In fact with some of the entries I can almost read verbatim the abstract that it references.   (In general I find CRC press books too pricey 
 This book bothered me a lot. The author begins by presenting himself and his spiritual quest and accomplishments. He tells us that he attained high states of consciousness. I guess this is done as a substitute to any scientific proof of what follows. Don't get me wrong. I don't deny his experiments or the data collected over years, or the validity of almost anyone of his statements. But generally, there is tendency from the author's part to at least vaguely indicate how he came to some of his conclusions! I think our time is better spent reading something else. Also, I recommend to anybody interested in reading this book to read what wikipedia has to say about the author 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 Numerous occasions of poor writing and some wrong statements of fact combine to disappoint me. Some of the more egregious examples are these. On page 37 we read "astronomically small", which is an oxymoron. On page 68 we read "billions of chemical compounds that were known to exist." There are only about 20 million known at this time. On page 82 we read "...literally picking one's self up by one's bootstraps..." The bootstrap business is a figure of speech, not a literal statement of fact. (It is also a cliché). On page 136 we read "The vice-like grip of the black hole's gravitational field is so great that nuclei are ripped apart..." I believe it is the high temperature, not the pressure, that dissociates the nucleons. On page 185 the aliens are said to reply "We understand what cobalt-60 is. We know which element has sixty protons in its nucleus." Cobalt still has only 27 protons. It's hard to trust a book that has such obvious mistakes 
 Rather than a concise history of the Middle East this book offers only 146 pages of brief summary of outside powers effects on the region.  This isn't a history of the Middle East, it's a history of how Europe, the US and the Soviet Union interacted with the Middle East. Though undeniably important in understanding the region, Western and Eastern relations with the Middle East are not the only reasons for studying it. There is more going on, far more, that Shlaim does not address, and it opens a large crediblility gap.  What is missing? A lot.  This might be a good book if it's only goal were to teach people a very concise history of Western and Eastern relations to the Middle East, so perhaps it is just poorly titled. The information that it did offer though seemed good enough, and it provided a fair overview of US relations with the Middle East, but I expected more and was dissapointed 
 Clint Black greatest hits ? Not much to write home about, sorry to say. It`s realy a downfall his version of the Eagles master peace Desperado. Sometimes everything goes wrong here, especially his voice. But anyway let`s take a look at the bright side on this album. The best songs are Track 15 No Time to Kill, which have a certain sting to it when it comes to  singing capacity and country flavour. Track 14 Life gets away  also is a good listen, an has hit poential. It sounds like belive it not like the The Cure crossover with country music. Track 11 Cadilack Jack Favor also have some charm. Track 8 We tell Ourselves swings a little bit too. Track 6 A better man has quality and "swing along". Track 2 Summers Commin kick a little , but the rest of the tracks don`t make me feel "country halleluja", sorry to say. Clint Black is not up there with Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks 
 I agree with some of the other reviewers - don't get this book unless you want *everything* on this subject - this is written by a person that really doesn't understand the concepts behind why most people get pierced. Also -  you'll get more pics and illustrations in your average tattoo mag 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 I purchased this book based on the promise of its title, a promise not kept.  The book is almost wholly about white-water kayaking, ignoring my  main interest, lakes, ocean, lagoons, and simple  rivers without complicated white-water rapids.  The book title includes the word "complete"  and the book is far from that.  It also limits  itself mostly to one-man kayaks, little helpful  about how to select a kayak to buy.    -Jon Claerbou 
 Too bad, the lowest rating is a "one" star....because I would have given it "0" stars.  Very disappointed and a complete waste of money and time.  I broke the cardinal rule, I bought the book on a 'whim' and didn't even open the book before purchase...my ERROR don't let it be yours!  I skimmed the book in less then 30 minutes, less I actually think, because there is NOTHING of value in it!  Terry Allen wrote strictly of his personal experiences, which were very one sided and lacked ANY substance.  For example, he states, he sold 100 worth of options to his family for $1 each, then sold the stock years later for $100,000 each.  Question is how!?  Why would anyone buy stock from members of his family for $100,000 each?  What did the investors get in return, what was the basis for the sale?  No information is given.  There is just a bunch of incomplete thoughts and ideas in this book.  Sad and totally disappointed with myself for spending any money but mostly disappointed to think that apparently anybody can write a book with absolutely no value in it and still get it published.  Did the publisher even read the book?  Did anyone?  Doubt it because it is a complete waste of paper and ink 
 This book is a terrible representation of the Navajo Indians.  None of the information that is in this book is a valid representation of  their traditions. The information that we are teaching to our children from this book is false and very stereotypical.   It should be taken out of every school 
 Take Eugene Levy (Puhleez!), his former Canadian (R.I.P.)SC-TV alum John Candy and add 'Commando's' Dir., Harold Ramis and (!) James Keach (!!) to the writers and what do you have? An only moderately funny John Candy movie! There are some great bits in here - but this movie is  the greatest waste of space (make that talent!) since Greenland! Robert Loggia and Meg Ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles. And Levy with Ryan?! About  as bad as Billy (Clipper-fan, his only  redeeming quality!) Crystal with Ryan!  Or Tom Hanks! Lester did better here  than with 'Commando',but is that really  saying much!? 
 An unbelievable waste of time.  There's no point in finishing the book. I can't feel for any of the characters or care what happens to them. One of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. 
 Leo the Late Bloomer occupies a dusty, terrifying shelf in one of the furthest reaches of my memory.    To a child who is already depressed and uncertain, Leo offers no solace.  I found him pathetic, and because I was like him, I found myself pathetic all the more.  Leo is the prisoner who escapes while the others languish.  He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about.  It's nice for Leo that he "bloomed," but the child is still miserable.  You think I am kidding.  I wish I was.    I do not blame the book per se, though.  With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.  But read alone, on the floor of an otherwise empty room, with no one to translate the allegory, it only tightens the noose.  
 I was somewhat disapppointed with this. It was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a concise chord chart-I did not find this extremely helpful in returning me to my music 
 The book does not clearly take you from A-Z-beginner to pimp-as your lead to beleive.  The author talks about campaigning and macking, but does not describe how to break social barriers, how to powerframe and condition one's psychie, etc.  There is a lot of useful information about dress. The author basically describes the game and how to recruit prostitutes by using an online escort out call service.  It is often written in long convoluted sentences.  An entertaining read, but not helpful 
 Hi, i got the book to enforce my knowledge about Vb and Databases. People PLEASE DO ME A FAV AND DON'T buy this boo 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 I got this book right after it came out and read it the same day I bought it. It was...to put it mildly..horrible. Several times throughout the book I thought I was going to have to make a run for the bathroom to empty the contents of my stomach. I kept on hoping that it would pick itself up and turn around until I reached the end and found that it would never be able to do so. When finished, I found that this book left me with a nauseated feeling and I could not read for close to 6 months for fear of something similar happening in another book. I do not recommend this book for anyone, especially people of the younger generation. What went wrong that Dekker's writing style changed so dramatically? 
 Even though the author claims to have graduated "magnum cum laude" from Harvard, this work is clearly a work of fiction instead of an "untold true story."  I'm sure it was written to be made into a Hollywood movie, but when you lose all credibility, it ends up in the Amazon Bargain Books section instead of the NY Times Bestseller list.  First, anyone who has been to Tokyo knows that it doesn't look anything like New Jersey upon first glance.  Second, the idea of climbing down the first escape in the middle of an earthquake is ludicrous.  Third, no ultra-hip Tokyo club would have US Marines as patrons.  Fourth, Ivy League schools don't give athletic scholarships (only financial aid).  The list goes on and on.  If it's a fictionalized account based on a true story, then don't be afraid to admit it 
 Stuart Gordon's 1985 flick RE-ANIMATOR is one of the few genre flicks that successfully combines high-camp horror with bawdy sexual humor and comes out with a cult classic.  But where Gordon's work triumphs, Brian Yuzna's 1990 sequel, BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, proportionally fails.  The gore, the nudity, and the sexual innuendo are blatantly gratuitous, and even strong performances from stars Jeffrey Combs (as mad scientist Herbert West) and Bruce Abbott (as Dan Cain, West's protg) can't hide the fact that the humor is no longer as glib and flippant as in the first film and instead seems painfully contrived.  And ardent fans of Gordon's film will be peeved when they see that Yunza has ignored basic plot points of the first, especially in the unexplained revival of a key character killed in the first (i.e., Herbert West himself) and the apparent demise of one saved at the first film's climax (i.e., Cain's girlfriend, Megan Halsey).  The FX work in BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR is a real mixed bag, and overall, FX fans will come away disappointed.  But one make-up worth noting is the Frankenstein-ish body-suit work done for the re-animated character played by the attractive Kathleen Kinmont.  The exposed muscles, tissues, and organs look gruesomely realistic and should delight gore fans and necrophiliacs alike.  The DVD from Artisan will disappoint even the most avid fans of this dreadful sequel.  The original film was shot on 35mm film in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but the filmmaker's intentions were for the film to be "matted" and viewed at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Unfortunately, Artisan caters to the couch-potato mentality and presents the film on DVD in the 1.33:1 format in which the film was shot.  While nothing is missing (it is 1.33:1 but NOT pan-and-scan), the film is still being presented contrary to the vision of its creators.  And on top of that, Artisan doesn't offer any extra parts (i.e., bonus material)!  Herbert West would be mortified 
 Anna Qiuindlen wrote a very jeuvenile novel this time.  Her past books were worthy of praise but this is a silly story. I was very disappointed and need to remind myself not to buy a book from an author that I have previously enjoyed until I read reviews.  
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 The author, Fritz, breaks the most elementary rules of scholarly writing this volume by quoting the same references several times in a row - something even an undergraduate would know to avoid.  It wouldn't be so bad, if he wasn't quoting the contentious and quite probably fictional FORGOTTEN SOLDIER. Fritz adds nothing new to the discussion of German soldiers in WW II, and readers are advised to turn to other material, such as SOLDAT by Siegfried Knappe.    FRONTSOLDATEN is simply a collection of quotes from dubious sources - and all secondary ones at that. Fritz does not appear to have conducted a single interview on his own. How then can he claim to have any kind of grasp on what it was like to be a German soldier, if he's never actually talked to one?   This book is not "scholarly" as some claim, as scholarship generally insists on multiple documentary sources, and a modicum of primary research.  Fritz didn't research this book - he cribbed it from other sources.   Readers serious about the German military in World War Two will have to wait for a definitive book on the Landser to appear in English.  
 I've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time, but they've finally hit bottom.  The bulk of the April 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars.  Yes, todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized, but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops.  PC Mag has been drifting far afield, doing articles on Apple computers, gaming systems, and extensive reviews on cameras.  Instead of PCs, the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it, or is in some way remotely related to computers.  The obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the PC world, so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages.  I find that hard to believe; I think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus, or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about PCs.  The lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent.  What used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of Time magazine.  They now have a "new look", and it's awful.  Their readership used to consist of well educated, technically sophisticated professionals.  These people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph, with cutesy "handwritten" notes belaboring the obvious.  That's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans.  Compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago, and it's obvious that they've "dumbed down" the entire magazine.  I've subscribed to PC Magazine for years, and considered it a "must read" to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the PC world.  But no more -- it's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of Personal Computers. 
 I am a new dad with a 10-week old daughter.  So I am currently living the period of fatherhood covered by this book.  I was also a military officer, so I am pretty well versed on military jargon, acronyms, and humor.  I found this book to be neither helpful or funny.  It was actually so annoying that I started to skip sections trying to get to the end faster, and then I just decided to stop reading entirely.  From an information stand point, you will learn nothing that you won't get from the dozens of random people giving you unsolicited advice and stories of their own experience.  If you want accurate, detailed, and thorough information, this is not the book for you.  [... 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
 In this novel Dan Jenkins is as racist and raunchy and laugh-out-loud  funny as ever.  But the novel failed to keep my interest.  Billy Clyde  Puckett is in search of something interesting to do with his life now that  his football and commentating days are over.  Unfortunately for the plot of  the novel he never finds it. RIP Billy Clyde 
 I received this set of knives for Christmas 2006 and the larger knife came defective. And since they advertise a "limited lifetime warranty" I figured I go straight to the manufacturer for a replacement. Bad idea. I contacted them in early January 2007 and no one got back to me. Then in early February I contacted them again. When I called they told me to email them describing the issue. I did and after a couple weeks and a lot of frustration I called back. This time I was told to send an email. Oh, what a surprise. I explained that I already sent an email and I was told that they were going through some changes and I was assured that someone would respond to my email this time. So I sent yet another email describing the problem. But unlike the previous emails, this one received a response. The email asked that I submit their return authorization form, which I completed and faxed back. Over two months later and I'm still wondering when this knife will be replaced.   So what good is a "warranty" if you can't get in touch with the company so they can honor their warranty? 
 This is total BS. Absolutely nothing grounded in reality. These people or completely mad. Unless you believe in magic and hocus pocus, stay away. Scary!! 
 Sorry, I am confused why and African-American woman would be so docile and unable to defend herself. How could she not get a drop on the the main character's assistant -- Oh Come On. Anyway, sorry this book did not do much for me 
 This book should take a day or two to read...but it took me about two months.  The main character is so annoying that I wanted him to die and that is the only reason I finished it.   George has come a long way from this book...so don't lose faith in him with this horrible start to his career 
 The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 This book de-evolves into a manifesto of what Greeley would like to see in the next Pope. It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker 
 The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money 
 I was happy with this product when I first purchased it but now I want my money back. I used the labels to put my name and contact info on photo equipment (compact flash cards, lenses, cameras) but the text faded making the labels pointless. (And on a few items the labels started coming off) It's probably fine for other uses but the labels don't last on things that are in the elements and being handled on a regular basis. I've used a   more expensive labelmaker in the past and haven't had a problem with the labels fading or coming off (and they looked nicer too). This is a classic "you get what you pay for" situation 
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 ~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it. 
 Yuck.  This book was totally boring.  Well, maybe you'll like it if you're, like, 7 or 8 years old or something.   Not only is it totally boring, but poorly written.  Which surprised me because Ann M. Martin is  certainly not a bad writer!  I'm really glad she left the BSC and started  writing a new series about them.  The BSC books are soo boring and  childish.  Please- a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog  runs loose for 2 seconds.  Don't waste your time reading the BSC books.   They are all pretty dumb 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 This book is a good start for someone that has no idea what to do to take care of their muscles and joints.  As a martial artist, active in the gym (weights) and a therapeutic massage therapist, I found this book to be a waste of time.  On the positive side, it is a quick read and I have reinforced, by second oppinion (the book), that I know more about taking care of myself than the average bear.  In purchasing this book, I was hoping to find something that I didn't already know or something that I didn't think was common sense.  If you have never played sports, never taken care of your body (stretching, contrast therapies, proper posture) then this book is for you 
 Half of these stories I have read before, and the other half I did not like. Everything in this book is pointless. First of all, Sedaris' name in big letters on the cover. Why? Because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection. The reason the book is published? To benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about. Well, I am giving two stars and not one, just because I liked the color of the cover. Kind of greenish salad color. 
 I would've given this book 4 stars, but to link the trilobites to evolution this way is very misleading. The whole unbiased scientific community today advocates the "intelligent design theory". I thought that people who hallucinate darwinist pseudo-science only find room for their pens in commercial corporate pages. Use this book for information about trilobites, but use Harun Yahya's books to read about evolution first. They're legally available online for free even 
 The first thing you should know is that this book is not really intended to teach you the GOF patterns -- read the GOF book for that. That said, it does do a decent job of translating the GOF patterns into C#.  My main gripe, and it is a big one, is that this book is *very* difficult to read because half of the relevant material is in the form of "challenges" whose answers are in an appendix at the back of the book. Please note that these "challenges" are not supplemental exercises that can be skipped -- they contain key information that is needed to understand the implementation of the pattern. Having to jump back and forth on nearly every page make the book almost unusable 
 The description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in "rugged" conditions. In reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber. I suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage, but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling 
 I figure it was Seabrook who began this fad of europeans going to Haiti and while looking around Haiti with racist eyes using terms like "primitive" etc but at the same time, trying to steal knowledge that europeans no absolutely nothing about..knowledge that the west isn't even ready for. Europeans say the things done in Haiti are impossible but there are dozens of destructive eurocentric pale people who traveled there (while maintaining their western mentality towards people of color, also known as relentless-racism) and run around chasing light-skinned Haitian women (like Wade davis and the rest) and learn less than 1% of what African spirituality really has to offer, then come back to amerikkka and write a book about their experiences with the "primitives"....Its funny because they all admit they went through things that are said to be impossible in the west....but yet they still call the Haitians and their ways "primitive". It disgusts me. After going through the mental trauma that the African's in Haiti went through, caused by european slavetrading monsters, they have what is called "Post-traumatic slavery symdrome". Thats the only reason they allow european blood-suckers to come to that island of freedom, or as Seabring called it, "the Magic Island", and exploit African knowledge. Haiti is the true "Land of the Free". Haiti did a statistically impossible deed, the only successful slavery uprise in the course of written history. Haiti defeated the french, spanish and english and kept that little island for themselves. Haiti has had many corrupt governments, due to the mulatto's affect on the government and many other reasons and while they are trying to get it back together some troublemaking good-for-nothing colorless nonpigmented melaninless pale people walk their bony little bodies onto the "Magic Island" and try to steal African secrets while the brothers there are going through hell due to european influence,western politics and inner turmoil started by outsiders. If the europeans didnt have the evil inside them to start the slave trade the Haitians would still be in Dahomey ruling their own Kingdom, they'd steal be in Sierra Leonne counting their diamonds that flow like rivers there, the Haitians would still be Benin contributing to the oldest religion on the face of the planet, if the Haitians werent illegally kidnapped they'd still be in the Congo which has more natural resources than nearly any other spot in the world. All the Haitians went through and moral-less europeans are still bothering those great people....damn shame....well at least Seabrook appeared to have got what he deserved for trying to exploit African secrets...Seabrook went crazy and died in his end...maybe because of something he saw...maybe because of something he said...who knows....but in my opinion, either way..he got exactly what he deserved 
 I still have not gotten it to work. The motor works, but I can't get suction into the inlet tube. The basket that holds the carbon media is very poorly designed; it opens easily, spilling the charcoal out into the canister (where it doesn't belong). I did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place. There is also a "rigid core" that fits inside the basket; my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it (I can see how it would happen). I reordered a replacement, and it was several WEEKS before it shipped.  Overall, I have not had a very good experience with this filter, although if I could get the $@#% thing to work, I might form a different opinion. 
 This book looks as if it went to publishing without editing.  I have read a lot psychology and find the subject interesting.  I am educated - professional engineer and attorney.  I usually understand what I am reading.  But this book forced me to re-read sentences and paragraphs because I could not understand what the authors were saying.  Often I just moved on.  Either the authors were not sure themselves or I just couldn't get it.  But two things were clear, the book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice with high-sounding amorphous words that seem to be intended to leave you either in awe or just completely frustrated.  It reads like a first draft that went straight to publishing.  My wife found reading it painful at best and she never made it through.  The authors also seemed little concerned about citing their authority.  Do they just make this stuff up?  I felt the advice was unreliable.  
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 ...I would have quit after 50 pages or so. Ms. Borchardt successfully created a mysterious atmosphere by not explaining many of the characters' actions. There are many undercurrents and mystical events that are never explained. Perhaps if you are an expert on mythology, some of the mysteries will be apparent to you. I'm fairly well read, but much of the book went over my head. I won't buy another of her books 
 Somehow, author Ted Yeatman has made Jesse and Frank James boring.  One has to admire the depth and breadth of his research into the lives of the notorious Missouri outlaws, but what was desperately needed here was a co-author who knew how to tell a good story.  One bank or train robbery sounds pretty much like all the others in Yeatman's plodding account, and I could not keep the brothers' numerous gang members straight -- the author does nothing to make them come alive as individuals.  The appendices and bibliographical notes are rather awe-inspiring -- Yeatman has done his homework, and then some -- but getting through this book is a hard slog 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a novel writen by Wallace Stegner.  I have heard many great things about Stegner's work, so i picked this up with  much anticipation.  Perhaps his other books are  much better, but this book is not good.  And when  I say that I'm being very gracious.  The story centers around a family of four, Bo,  his wife, Elsa, and their two sons Chester and Bruce. The novel follows them from place to place throughout America, about their poverty, and overall faliure.  The fundamental problem with the book is this:  You're supposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck. But you don't because the author would rather give you  pointless detail (while ignoring important detail) than help you get to know and like the characters.  By the time that their lives are ruined you don't even like any of the  characters.  If the author had spent more time developing a mental relationship between you and this family than the book could pull the right strings.  Then there is also the question of possibility.  Is it really possible for a person (Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutly everything? And pushing it even further is it possible for this person to not be able to make any money what so ever.  In this book It describest this husband as being a great baseball player (yes he's hurt, but why not become a coach or something?), a nearly flawless hunter, and many other things.  Yet he remains broke for thirty years?  Also the seemingly dramatic parts of this book are more funny than dramatic.  Wallace Stegner may have written many other good books. Through his writing i can see some potential.  But in this book his potential even as a good writer only shows when he's "in a groove".  When he's in a groove he seems to have a tallent for writing, but when he's not, his sentences are long and jumbled and often don't even make sense.  If you don't believe me then here is the first sentence of the book just to prove it to you:  "The train was rocking through wide open country before Elsa was able to put off the misery of leaving and reach out for the freedom and release that were hers now."  See what i mean?  I'm sure that a writer such as Dickens or Hemingway never put down a sentence that confusing.  For that sliver of potential i award this book it's one and a half stars, but keep in mind, this may be the worst book i've ever read 
 After reading the other reviews, I am wondering if I have a defective model.  Here is our experience with this machine:  We've had a floormate since 2001. We loved our original floormate, so when it conked out, we bought this model. It DOES NOT clean the floors, at all! The "new and improved" brushes don't even touch the floor most of the time. It doesn't suck up the excess water as well as the older one, so you're basically just pushing dirty water around the floor. We are so dissapointed, we've went back to cleaning on our hands and knees 
       I hated this book!  Or maybe I was just rooting for C.J. to get his stuff together in the third book and have Joe Pickett ready to fly for another twenty years.  It's what I expected anyhow.  Didn't happen.   	    The first Joe Pickett story seemed a little tall and convoluted, but the yarn was spun tightly and with dexterity and wit.  I couldn't put it down.  You knew that C.J. Box and Joe Pickett would be around for a long while.  The second book had me looking forward to more Joe Pickett yarns in spite of exploding cows.  An audience was building.  Word was getting around that C.J. Box could keep you interested.  It was time for Pickett to settle down a bit, ease off the fantastics, and start a long career.  Then he fell off the mountain.       WINTERKILL opens with a humiliating and extremely unlikely scene of a Forest Supervisor's "nervous breakdown" that contributes nothing substantial to the story.  From there, it traverses a litany of extremes.  Our humble, heroic game warden in remote Wyoming is forced down a gauntlet of sociopathology, psychopathology, political aberrations, weather extremes, bureaucratic obstruction and cover-up, and the killing of a carefully developed sympathetic character.  Then, incredibly, staight-arrow Joe Picket becomes complicit in a felony that will never be discovered.  	    C.J. Box is a clever, compelling writer, but I don't see how Joe Pickett will ever recover from this dark detour.    
 My kids (okay, my husband) purchased me a junior cookbook for Mother's Day last year. My 3-year-old and I have enjoyed several recipes out of that book. I decided to try and find another book that we would enjoy as well. After reading the online reviews for this book, I made the purchase. However, when it arrived, I was disapointed to find a lot of recipes that wouldn't fit my family's tastes. I thought the illustrations for the recipes was a clever idea, but didn't like the idea of flipping back and forth from the drawings to the detailed instructions. I'm returing this book and will again begin my quest to find a cookbook that my kids and I can enjoy together 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 I had high hopes when I picked up this book because Styron is a terrific writer and I was interested in the subject. By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room. Admittedly, Depression makes for a tough topic, but that's not good enough.  There's more to Depression than staring at an empty page, unable to muster the courage to write one single word. The dark places of the soul also have their fires, their drama, even if they are played out in secret.   I will grant that the writing is spare and elegant, as you would expect. But I would have traded all the insider literati name-dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt, something that put me there with him. I have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction.   Styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism, but the self-destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego, frequently it heralds the triumph of ego. In Darkness Visible, Styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment, showcasing a carefully polished veneer, never inviting the reader in. 
 I can point out many reasons why this book must never be bought. The main two are  . The review is ridiculously basic. At least, here in Brasil, every high school student knows 70-80% of everything that is written there.  . There are lots of errors through the tests. Sometimes the questions are wrong, sometimes the choices are wrong, others the resolution is wrong. And believe me, there are cases where all three are simultanously wrong 
 This book was compiled with the assistance of many people (p.xi), and makes for interesting reading of these sixty plus cases. You will be educated in reading this book, but do not assume these stories to be complete and accurate. They are the equivalent of a TV show, meant to be entertaining.  The Boorn Case gets a fuller discussion in Edmund Pearson's "Studies in Murder", who does not discuss the story of a "conspiracy". It defies common sense for a poor farmer in Vermont to have access to a man in New Jersey! The main point is there was no proof of any murder, or that the bones belonged to Russell Colvin. The hanging of a Harvard Professor was based solely on circumstantial evidence, a first in America. The Judge's instructions were in favor of the prosecution (pp.105-6). His story about Lizzie Borden is in error. Edmund Pearson's book was shown in error by Edward Radin's 1961 book, and his in turn. There were no bloodstains on Lizzie or Bridget, and no murder weapon found. Neither were a likely suspect, except they alone were present. David Kent's "Forty Whacks" gives a better treatment of this unsolved murder puzzle. The Judges' instructions correctly favored the defendant. Any story about the "Black Sox" and Shoeless Joe Jackson should refer to Eliot Asinof's 1963 book "Eight Men Out" which covers this story better.  The Alger Hiss trial divided America, "but not along class or party lines". Hiss was convicted of perjury in saying he did not recognize Whittaker Chambers. But a picture taken around 1935 shows Chambers (under his false name) to be around 145 pounds, sandy haired, and with a mustache. Compared to the 1948 Chambers, 300 lbs gray and bald, they do look like two different men. See for yourself. Chambers claimed these papers were a "life preserver", but were worth little without his corroboration. And Hiss, unlike real Soviet spies, never left America after his release. There are problems with the evidence (p.316).  The book "Tainting Evidence" has a chapter on the evidentiary problems in the Jeffrey MacDonald case. This is mentioned on pages 435-6. There is no evidence of any payoff to get MacDonald convicted. One of the most publicized and yet unknown case is the OJ Trial. The limousine driver picked him up at 11pm and drove him to the airport. OJ could not have personally murdered his ex-wife and the visiting waiter. The Medical Examiner who did the autopsies testified that the forensic evidence said they were murdered after 11pm. [The red, liquid blood suggests murder after 11:30pm, just before the bodies were found.] These facts trump manufactured evidence like the planted glove and fabricated blood evidence. In June 1996 the Los Angeles Times reported that the lead detective took away blood samples of the victims before the evidence was turned in for DNA testing. O.J. Simpson escaped the fate of Dr. Sam Shepard (or Tom Mooney). Isn't it true that murders by organized crime are rarely solved by the police? 
 how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess.  the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts  of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts.  the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well. 
 Yes, I understand this is not a novel, but it is as dryly written as a computer manual.  It's a shame because the story is compelling, true and quite dynamic 
 I NEVER received this DVD. AMAZON REFUSED to compensate me stating that the retailer had. I just took the hit.   
 It just didn't do it for me.  Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading.  But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story.  He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.   Good writing?  Yes.  Interesting characters?  Somewhat.  Compelling plot?  No.   Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers.  Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with.  Maybe he just tried too hard. 
 Despite the beautiful poetic descriptions of nature which are peppered throughout his books, James Lee Burke falls short as a mystery writer. An author shouldn't concentrate more on describing the environment than developing the plot, which is exactly what he does. And after you've read a number of his novels about the jaded ex-cop Dave Robicheaux, you start to realize that they all follow a very strict, formulaic pattern, so formulaic that I think I can summarize the generic plot of every one of Burke's novels. They all go pretty much as follows:  First, Dave Robicheaux unwittingly becomes involved in some sordid affairs, so he decides to start poking his nose around. He is threatened by criminals to stay out of their affairs, but instead of complying he beats them up and continues investigating. Despite the warnings, he is utterly shocked when the villains retaliate by harming someone close to him. The case having become more personal, Robicheaux begins running from place to place, making obtuse accusations and threats to various people until he earns the animosity of almost every character in the book. He eventually stumbles upon the solution to the mystery, and he never manages to punish those responsible because his hands are tied legally. Ultimately, it turns out that things would have worked out better for everyone had he simply not stuck his nose where it didn't belong, and there is nothing quite as disappointing as finishing a book and finding out that nothing worthwhile was accomplished by the protagonist.  Aside from this, Robicheaux becomes tiresome quickly. Though he is a decent enough guy, it is very difficult to have sympathy for a man who brings all his troubles on himself with his stupidity and unwillingness to stop poking his nose into other people's affairs.  If you feel that you absolutely have to read one of these books, my advice is to pick one at random, read it, and then don't read any of the others. Believe me, they are all the same. 
 I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.  Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring: 1. Added more suspenseful climaxes 2. Taken out unimportant information 3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format 4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail. I popped it in my bose wave radio, turned it up to 85, and listened to the most annoying hissing sound I've ever heard coming from my system. I regret purchasing this cd 
 This dictionary WAS good up until my child was in 1st grade. Ever since then, we are unable to find words in this dictionary!!  It is a very frustrating experience for a child to actually use the book and then find this book does not have the words they need!! Only use this book for the early reader 
 This new 3rd edition is barely decent, not great. In some ways, it's easily worse than the good 2nd edition(!)...  First off: the most obvious change here is in its *size*: this 3rd edition is about 2/3 as big as the 2nd edition- tiny! I'm talking about the overall physical dimensions: mainly length & width, with depth not being radically changed.  Most of the lettering is the same size as before, although a few pages include microscopic printing. These new physical dimensions are *not* an improvement. This whole book has an uncomfortably crammed look & feel, not unlike a packed elevator ride. "Get me outta this thing!" is my honest reaction here.   Maybe it's because I'm so used to the 2nd edition: I consider it to be the *BEST* version, even though I only rated it as being somewhat above average. The 2nd edition is basically good, and I'm glad I have it, but I still don't think *any* version of Rapid Viz has lived up to its real, full potential. My basic complaint with these books is that the illustrations themselves often look a little too unfinished and sketchy, lacking the true detail & depth that a 5-star book might have. At other times, some drawings actually have *too much* microscopic detail. And in an effort to make an already conceptually clear & concise book even more clear & concise, this new 3rd edition eliminates some drawings & photos along the way(!). Even worse: the photos that *have* been included are reproduced poorly, as if they were printed with a cheap, pre-Internet, black & white inkjet printer. I thought new editions of books were supposed to get better, not worse! I give this thing 1 star because it's a completely unnecessary downgrade- at best.  In short: Yes, this 3rd edition has a fancy, new, computer designed cover, but I easily recommend the better 2nd edition *by far*.  **Copy and paste 1560520558 to search for the better 2nd edition here on Amazon. It's still available today!* 
 I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material.  There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live.  All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s).  What a shame 
 We tried this griddle.  It worked just fine ONCE.  After that, everything stuck.  Pancakes weren't turnable, just made a stuck-on mess.  Ditto with sausage, bacon, etc.  Pretty bad hot-spots at the edges, cool in the middle.  Going to buy another brand ASAP 
 I don't know how Out of Sight made the New York Times bestseller list when it came out.  This book could have been written by a high schooler.  The plot is nothing to write home about and Elmore's writing style is sub-par.  The book lacks suspense.  I knew (and you will, too) exactly how the book was going to end about 10 pages into it. The book is also lacking in emotion and description.  It reads like this:  Foly said, "..." She said, "..." He said, "..." The she said, "..."  Get the idea? The book is a very easy read that could maybe entertain you for the weekend, but don't expect to be wowed by "the best crime novelist of our time" 
 I ususally like Deepak Chopra but this time he really let me down.  He is just another one trying to make a buck praying on people who a desperate to find a solution to rind those extra kilos 
 I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost.  Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing.   There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters.  Ugh.  I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard.  The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye.  Get a different version 
 Same old mistakes as previous versions, same old clumsy ratings.  What the hell is "PG" supposed to mean?  Why are the same climbs denoted with an alpha and numerical listing???  If you do not own a copy, it is a "must have" but only because you do not have a choice! 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 The best part of reading this book was finishing it, and turning directly to Jonathan Kozol's "Shame of the Nation".  The Thernstroms bombard readers with "facts", graphs, charts, and a whole lot of stereotypes and dangerous assumption.  For starters, they must have a different place in mind when they describe the "affluent town" of Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Clearly they've never stepped outside the Ivy walls of Harvard Square.  If they did, they would see first hand the gross injustice being done in the shadows of these walls...an urban public high school that is nowhere near the profile that they provide.  They go on to describe, with great confidence, different groups as chapter titles as crass as "Asians" "Hispanics" and "Blacks". Don't bother with this...pick up anything by Kozol, Deborah Meier, Gary Orfield, Richard Elmore, or Richard Rothstein instead 
 Reading this book is like watching TV. Well, if only you know how TV screws up your mind 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
 BUYER BEWARE..Vendor will tell you that the book is coming. They even game me a tracking number from 2005. I sent numerous emails and I was even given a song and dance about the book delivery was attempted when I wasn't home. The problem is that I have been home for WEEKS on a medical leave and have received all delivery's but this one. IMAGINE THAT!!!! No book and no money. BEWARE!!! 
 This guide has a nice collection of pictures (as compared to The Rough Guide to St Lucia), but feels much more general and outdated.  If you don't need pictures, I would go for The Rough Guide!  (I am still waiting to receive one more guide for St Lucia).  I am heading to the Coconut Bay Resort for my Honeymoon in June 
 If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book.  Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters.  There is not an ounce of structure to this.  It's just a bunch of thoughts and "reports" of sightings of UFO's, "mothmen" and other oddities.  I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel.  I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance.  All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!? 
 Current events contribute to the genius of pulp prose. The larger lesson made evident by the Katrina hurricane disaster as well as the recent but already forgotten corporate corruption scandals is that both events had to happen as both meteorologists and economists prophesied they would. Our short sighted judiciary paralyzed but conflicting motives did nothing. So I would say this book proves that, along with staring at the sun too long, money causes blindness 
 This book is a complete watse of time for the educated strength and conditioning coach.  This book does not apply the latest theories and conditioning drills that will aid in your athlete's performance. Programs  are not periodized and relay on outdated principles of reps/sets schemes.  If your a beginner to weight training and conditioning then this book may  be for you 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?! 
 Take this book Back!  That's waht I think. I have taught myself many programs including flash & excell from books but this book stinks!  I am a novice to access and learned nothing on how to create anything from scratch.  All this showed me is how to use an existing database.  Well that does me no good since i can't figure out how to make my own!  Time to find a better book 
 I just heard this album the other day... it had been a while since I laughed so hard.  This is the most absurdly pretentious attempt at opera rock since King Diamond.  It's more ridiculous than Meat Loaf, except Meat Loaf doesn't take himself so seriously.  For a second it sounded like they were trying to harden their sound, which is about as out-of-place as David Spade trying to butch up his image by wearing football armor.  Then I noticed that they had changed labels to Roadrunner, a label notorious for trying to make every band sound the same; so apparently Roadrunner is trying to make them sound like metal.  The slight changes in their sound have nothing to do with growth or maturity, they just got a new producer.  This album is basically just the MTV / short attention span version of their previous albums, it's the exact same stuff but cut up and rearranged into smaller sections (don't worry, those gassy ten-minute songs are still there, they just get diced up a little like someone's channel-surfing)  I guess I should give them a little bit of credit for not trying so hard this time to conceal the fact that about 85% of the album is filler material, but I think their goal was commercial accessability.  Just more smoke and mirrors to try to make a comic book look like an art gallery.  I'd say that if you're into Opeth you would like this album, but actually there's a good chance that you won't, because it appears this is an effort to sell out. 
 [Wince.] Noticing that Reilly had been an international bestseller, I bought these audio CDs for a road trip and subsequently found myself embarrassed as I listened to a book that seemed to borrow all its plotlines from G.I. Joe cartoons. Listening to the audio version, I was amazed at Reilly's nerve in magically saving his hero time and again. Reilly even pummels the reader with the same language in the sentences preceding the countless near misses. The hero is about to be squashed, when just at the last second -- his friend uses a magnet to suck him back out of the way. The hero disappears off the cliff, when just before he hits the ground -- he manages to activate a parachute. The hero is about to be decapitated, when just at the last moment -- his friend comes back from the dead to shoot the brains out of his foe.     While Reilly no doubt did research to write this book, the flatness of his characters uncovers him as a grownup child still obsessed with battle action cartoons, good vs. evil comic books, action figures, and wham! pow! action scenes, but who never learned to relate emotionally on an adult level. The author himself writes in a book interview that it devastated him to have to cut off the life of his hero's girlfriend, an undeveloped character that's about as flat as my niece's stick figure drawings. As I listened to him talk about it, I felt sorry -- not for his character but for myself. After all, if he had wanted the reader to care, even a little, he could have taken the time to create just one conversation between the hero and his girlfriend 
 Unless you are looking for a way for your husband to get a new higher paying job or get a pay raise, this book is not for you.  I am currently a stay-at-home mom and absolutely love it, but am looking for a way to boost our income a bit.  The whole book is about techniques to find your husband a better job or to ask for a raise if he is underpaid.  There is one chapter on small jobs for extra income, but that's it 
 So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.   Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.   If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.   If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....   Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????   Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.  Hopefully, someday, there will be 
 As a fan of detective fiction, I am often amused by the sub-genres that develop; gourmet cooks, fly fishermen, lesbians, you name it.  So as a student of Spanish and a lover of Spain, I was pleased to discover a modern Spanish private detective.  Pepe Carvalho is a hard-boiled loner, a gourmet cook, a former communist and a former CIA spy.  He lives in Barcelona.  He has many sexual adventures.  So far, so good.  Unfortunately, there is very little detection in this book.  A crime occurs. Carvalho wanders around getting hit on the head.  He meets two beautiful women.  A past conflict with a police inspector is hinted at.  The criminal is revealed in an unconvincing way.  Carvalho goes home.  I kept waiting for some sluething, but it never happened.  The best part of this book was some very slight references to modern Spanish society and some probably accurate references to the history of the Spanish Communist Party.  The author is a prize winner, highly regarded and very successful.  I'll try him again, but this is not an exciting detective story 
 I don't believe that all of these people giving such rave reviews of this book have really used it for long. I also would tend to rate it very highly, except that there is a glaring typo, like the entire description, of hexagram #15. I used to have a copy of this book, and used it, and for the most part loved it, but I find it difficult to believe that an author of any integrity would not have done a revision by now, and corrected the error.  If that was done, I would happily buy and use another copy of this boo 
 I have been unable to get the software to work on my Dell computer with WINDOWS XP.  Although I have been in contact with the technical team at SBT on many occasions, my initial problem has never been resolved.  I am unable to use the Test & Improve Your Memory software 
 how can i write a review if i can't see the book.  you are telling me to review the book, but it is not available for review 
 Key points:  1. One should read Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) before reading "Ready for Anything" (RFA).    2. If you've read GTD, you can probably skip RFA.  It reinforces some core GTD principles, often in a mind-numbingly repetitive fashion (which can be a good teaching style), but also tries to fill in some of "The Vision Thing" content absent in GTD.  Unfortunately, Covey is better than Allen in addressing "The Vision Thing."  Together, GTD plus Covey's "7 Habits" and "First Things First" (FTF) make an interesting collection.    3. RFA suffers from the same design and layout issues I found with GTD: the "inspirational quotations"  in the margins destroy the reading flow as they push into the space occupied by the main text.  The quotes distract the reader from the main text due to their intrusion into such and a lack of white space. IMO, there are too many inspirational quotes.  Allen should have simply started each chapter with one relevant quote, ala Covey's "7 Habits..."  I've noticed that some of the inspirational quotes are recycled from GTD and are sometimes better than the associated essay in RFA.  To see how to place quotes or references in the margins of a book's pages, Allen should review any of Edward Tufte's books, such as "Beautiful Evidence."    4. There are obvious parallels throughout RFA to ideas in Covey's "7 Habits" and "First Things First."  However, there's no mention of Covey in the book (and he's only cited once in GTD via an inspirational quote).  Both Covey and Allen have interesting things to teach, but it seems Allen eschews any reference to Covey despite the obvious parallels to anyone who has read both authors.  In some cases, it seems Allen is taking pot-shots at Covey ideas, such as his reference to the "quadrant matrix" on page 22 of the paperback edition of RFA, an obvious reference to Covey's Urgent/Important matrix in FTF.  5. RFA makes no attempt to indicate when the included essays were originally published in Allen's newsletter.  It would be interesting to know when the original essay was published.  I'm sure they've been edited and updated for the book, but some connection to their stated original publication dates might be helpful in understanding where Allen was in his personal journey at the time he wrote the essay.  6. The "By the way..." items at the end of each RFA chapter may be valuable for readers who've not yet asked themselves some of the deeper questions or who are struggling with their GTD implementation.  7. IMO, the GTD Workflow chart, in a revised form in RFA, still needs work.  Perhaps they should not try to fit it on one page: use a two-page spread or, even better, a fold-out that one can also tear out.  The chart would benefit from the help of someone who knows how to draw flowcharts.  8. The paper in the paperback edition of  RFA is of a cheap, inferior quality compared to that used in the paperback edition of GTD.  To me, it feels like cheap newsprint.  9. RFA lacks an index.  A book like this, without an index, is most unfortunate, indicating perhaps a rush job to capitalize on GTD interest by recycling old essays.  Recycling content for additional profit is a good idea, but any book like this should include an index 
 Pigs at the Trough brings up all kinds of problems that present serious complications to American democracy and to the honest running of the market system - corporate corruption, conflicts of interests, tight connections between business and politicians, the lack of a tie between executive compensation and company performance, the malfeasance of the big four accounting companies.  Unfortunately, rather than analyzing these problems in a serious manner, she has written a harangue, full of name-calling, insults, and anger.  She seems to hope that inciting a listener's outrage will inspire action.  In this sense, she seems to have underestimated her audience - as though she'd lose their attention if she toned down her arguments and delved into the substance.  The audio CD was read in a breathless and sarcastic manner, which quickly became tiresome.       Everyone seems to be evil in her opinion - from politicians to lobbyists to corporate executives to pharmaceutical companies to mutual funds - the big and rich against the rest of us.  The suggested solutions, which take up a small section near the end, focus on what should be done, without little depth on who should take the steps and how this can be made to happen.    The benefit of the book is the bringing to light of issues that affect many Americans but are not often discussed in depth in the general media.  One can hope that someone else will pick up where Huffington started and provide a more sober analysis. 
 Have you noticed that anyone who writes a negative review on Amazon gets dinged more frequently??  Well, I'm using one of Maggie Mahar's take-away points who wrote about Gail Dudack and Jim Grant (market contrarians at the peak of the internet boom) to say this book is a not worth buying... I can almost hear the ding'ing now.  As the title suggests, this book is mostly about the market's history between Reagan to George W.  Within that space, its a narrow assimilation of 6-9 books, 4-5 market contrarian interviews, and mostly financial news articles.  For example, the stock market crash of '87 is very narrowly described as a cyclical and/or over-advancement of prices and over-exhuberance by buyers. Obviously, arguments such as these support the theme of the book.  However, stock market fluctuations are fantastically complex and influenced by broader economic conditions and triggers. Several interlinked elements contributing to '87 would have been helpful to learn about: the Fed strategies at that time, post-Plaza Agreement aftermath on the dollar, intricate problems from UAL failed LBO, Milken's problems with a number of restructings, why gold was down, Real Estate syndicates boom in Texas, S&L liquidity, etc. And I'm just a novice writing this from memory.  Mahar is no economist, statistician, nor trader.  Her style of writing and context of her arguments are similar to that of a financial journalist -- not unlike how "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" was written. Moreover, her tone towards the latter half of the book turns noticeable negative as she constantly applies (dare I say "manipulates") certain events/information to support her argument that the Bull market was soooooo clearly overvaluing stocks and everyone was stupid to be caught up in the frenzy.  Hind sight is 20/20.  Sometimes her statistical analysis is weak. For example, on pg 318, she writes about how insider stock sales/buys are incorrigible, were almost frauds, and how the public ignored the street signs: "... from 1995 through the end of 2002, the Tribune's analysis showed that in 25% of all cases, the share price of the company in question tumbled by at least 20%-and sometimes as much as 50%- in the six months following the sale.  Insiders were equally fortunate in picking their spots when buying their own companies' stock: more than half of all purchases preceded gains of more than 20%, which several well above 50%."  Her use of the Tribune's 2003 Dow30 study to support her argument lacks insight and analysis: (a) 75% of all cases conversely mean that insiders were wrong to sell, (b) about half the insiders who bought were dumb, and (c) during that same period, what were company-specific fluctations (ie knowledgeable to insiders) vs. simply relative correlations to the DJIA.   If you are a casual reader interested in a chronicle of the markets, this book provides an overview of the times.  However, if you are an investor with a medium-term memory, you may find that this book is not for you, as you invariably compare your recollections with her version of the chronicles; thus making this book questionable advice for the future.    In that regard, I was disappointed and could not help but to feel that this book represents not a "history" of that bull market, but rather "her history" of that bull market.  A good history book should give you confidence in your education's integrity and thoroughness, particularly if you were living back then and remember things (unlike "1776").    In summary, I didn't so much disagree with the writer's points, but rather hoped that it would have been more broadly educational and analytical in order for it to be helpful as we move thru the 21st Century.  -- P.S.  The above reviewer Mr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb is the author of "Fooled by Randomness" and complemented/cited by Mahar in this book. FYI. 
 Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.  Compared to this album, his follow up Powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser.  Find him working at a McDonalds near you soon!! 
 I am a huge fan of Lee since 1979 and have bought every album since then. contrary to what you read above this album is a disappointment for me. Lee is into 'african' at the moment so lots of tribal beats in background if you're into that. There's a great line-up of musicians but unfortunately even they cant do much with the music. The african girl sings Lovely Day - pretty good - makes it her own song. Lee's son plays drums but can't hear any drumming(!) - maybe on the final master they cut out his track? and supposedly co-writes one song. Dave Grusin and Lee plays in Lovely Days with some glimses of Harlequin album - well almost. Patrice Rushen background sings her song Forget me nots - but unfortunately not memorable unlike her original hit in the 80's. Overall nothing memorable and no tunes you can hum along. For this listener, I'll go back to listening to the truly great music from the earlier albums. 
 What a painfully boring book!  I was really looking forward to reading this book, as I normally love biographies and had heard some interesting things about Gellhorn.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be soooo boring!  What a waste of my money.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did 
 I read On the Road over 30 years ago in college. I was hooked and within two years I read everything JK had written. I bought a first edition of Visions Of Cody some years later and found it a monumental bore. While I'll nod to the readers that get off on the experimental nature of the prose, for someone like me, who thinks On The Road and The Dharma Bums are almost perfect, Cody is not much more than the rough cut...very rough...for On The Road 
 I can't believe that people are comparing Novembers Doom to Opeth. To put them both in the same sentence is heresy in its most profane, I feel bad even putting both their names in this same sentence.  First of all, Opeth are far more talented and craft epics that shatter and defy what we know of modern music, not to mention their contribution to the re-defining of Death Metal/Melodic/Doom. Novembers Doom are average at best, there is NO stellar musicianship or amazing epic songs on this album, or any other Novembers Doom albums I have heard.  The Pale Haunt Departure has its moments, though far and few between. Every song is marred with the horrid singing and cheesy Doom talking of the singer. Seriously, his singing SUCKS! His screams are decent though, and you can hear his lyrics(which suck and repeat about the same concepts through the whole album ie..not being good enough, is there a tomorrow, blah blah blah), but he sounds like a cheap immitation of the Amon Amarth vocalist.  I will admit some of their guitar riffs are pretty good, but they repeat the same parts over and over, as if they could not conjure up decent change ups and variations, and besides a few gems mostly sounds boring. The drummer sometimes sounds like he just started drumming, he uses his snare drum way too much and doesn't seem to know how to use it. There are a few decent drum parts, but nothing spectacular. There is virtually no bass at all, heard once in a while, when you can hear it, its average. But overall, the song structure and dynamics are horrible and poorly put together. I don't see why everyone praises these guys. Maybe I just don't get the whole Doom Metal genre and its fans, but this album is weak weak weak. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the intros are the best parts of the album, but after you get past 30 seconds of each song, the song turns into garbage. People are so willing to give out 5 stars to every album. The Pale Haunt Departure is not worth 5 stars at all, more like 2.  The Pale Haunt Departure makes me realize that anyone can make an album and get signed to a label 
 Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common)  Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment. So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring 
 The author is guilty of repeating a lot of bad science.  The is ABSOLUTELY no difference between table salt and sea salt as far as the body is concerned.  The same goes for natural vs artificial MSG, which is recognized as "generally safe" by the FDA.  I imagine a lot of people have taken to using sea salt on this bad advice.  It's just as likely to give you a stroke or heart attack 
 lousiest 10 dollars i spent. the tips are already bent and thats at maybe 10 minutes or so of fooling around with it. ive tried it with multiple guitars and the effects and theres no such thing as this thing getting a "bow" effect. i dunno. scratchy. i dont recommend this at all. ive been playing the guitar for about 13 years now. 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read...Diana Palmer needs to buy a Descriptionary so she can broaden her terminology and quit using the same words in different ways...You can only have so many 'wicked smiles', 'smiling wickedly', and 'he said with a wicked grin.'  By the time you are a quarter of a way through the book you have already put two and two together and know who the bad guys are...Maybe I need to move to Texas and become a Ranger because the very CLUELESS Marc Barron and his girlfriend that works for the State Attorney couldn't figure it out until the woman was in front of him pointing a gun....DUH!...Maybe if the Ranger spent more time trying to work the case instead of dipping his wick into his former girlfriend every 3 pages then it would have saved everyone a lot of time and maybe some of the characters in the book would still be alive and well...He more or less  sexually assaults his former girlfriend every chance he gets, when she says no he says yes (can you say rape?)and then makes comments that scream SEXUAL HARRASSMENT LAWSUIT FROM HELL...The characters aren't very well written, the former girlfriend is far more forgiving than the Virgin Mary at the Crucifixion...I would love to meet a woman like her that forgave me after I treated her like the main character did....Bypass this book, don't waste your time on it...A soap opera is more intelligently put together than this book....Talk about someone typing out garbage just to make a quota...Woof!...I have read better prose on the back of a shampoo bottle while taking a crap...Burn this book if you ever get your hands on it and save the world from this kind of tripe...If I could rate it lower than zero I would be in negative 7 digits...I think you catch my drift.. 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 this is perhaps the worst read I have experienced in a long time in fiction as an art form.  Yet, sadly the misuse of the fiction form was dressed up as an attempt at human rights activism.  And even so, one wonders why this author is doing it, in this form, with this substance, at this juncture.  While the plights of ethnic montagnards in Southeast Asia are both a touchy subject and a worthy cause, this book seems to take this issue back to more than 30 years ago, thereby distracting our attention by diverting it from the present time to the past.  What we need to look at is their plights now, not what their plights were decades ago, in a context of a war that has become jaded with too much talk and not much understanding.  What do we learn, if anything at all, from this book regarding the plights of these forgotten people?  But what bothers me deeply is the obvious fact that the supposedly "deep" novel reads like a jungle one is forced to travel -- the "novel" defies every good sense about fiction as an art form -- the basics of gbood writinng -- character development, plot, movement, climax, showing-not-telling, etc.etc.etc. are all disregarded.  No wonder this book is a self-publishing endeavor...The fact that it allegedly on some prize decades ago in a war-torn country adds to the mystification as to how literature was judged at such time, in such place...And then there is the issue of the translation -- very good in some parts, quite naive and jaded in others... One is lost in trying to assess the art form and the worthy cause it allegedly carries -- is it a problem with translation, or is it a problem with this writer not knowing how to write fiction and taking too much of an effort at self-importance?  What I would even venture to say:  a matter of disingenuous intent?  I glanced at the previous reviews -- didn't help me a bit.  Everybody seemed to be from some same camp with the author -- People also seemed to be talking about the plights of the forgotten people of the mountains rather than the novelistic art, or the book itself...A very worthy cause indeed, but does this book do any justice to it, or does this book simply attempt to elevate itself by using the worthy cause to make up for its obvious short-comings in the matter of the art, and the craft, of writing?      
 The only way anyone would give this book more than 1 star is if they are a close friend of Snepp. The rest of the world wouldn't read it. How can a book be about so important a topic, get banned, taken to the Supreme Court, and remain so forgotten? Because the book sucks, it is pedantic, overwritten, and all about what a superspy Frank is. Most controversial books sell, even if they are crappy. This book is so crappy that it doesn't even sell, and thus it will remain a footnote to history 
 A beautifully complicated plot gets shortchanged by characterization that made me grit my teeth, especially that of the main character, Joe, who seems too much of a pale imitation of Robert Crais's Joe Pike character. The pacing is also a little uneven, and I found I couldn't suspend my disbelief for the action scenes. 
 This is a poor exegetical work by Tony.  He doesn't do his best.  There are far better works to consider 
 Why, oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of Crime & Punishment with John Hurt, using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime John Simm. I would download the 2002 version all day, everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair. Either offer me the version I want, or get the pictures right 
 By the time you see the ending, you'll already be wishing that you hadn't watched this movie 
 i love the ultimate fantastic four, i think it's the best ultimate book out there (ok tied with ultimate spider-man). the vols. 1-3, and 5-6 are great. but this one sucks. you really don't need to read it at all, i think maybe they were in between writers/artists at the time and just got someone to fill in on issues 19-20.  the annual isn't that great either, it just introduces the inhumans (basically johnny meets crystal). 
 I agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good.  OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying.  I love Charlie Murphy and the Ashy guy and I think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny.  Dave, come back to TV 
 This books has lots of detailed information. However, I felt that it lacks code examples, explaining the textual descriptions 
 Amazon should know better. It is possible in the whole world that 2 writers share the same name ! You shoud not list Viggo Mortensen's works of art : poetry /photography/paintings/and movies  with Viggo Mortensen's writings about theological concepts. The former is the actor, artist,  and the latter is the theologian. Please, be consistent ! A little clean up is in order (no pun intended!) 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 The Cat in the Hat By Dr. Seuss	 			By Shawn Hinz, 			 	This book is about a talking cat and two kids. Two kid's parents are gone for the day. The furry talking cat just comes in to there house and takes over the kid's house.  	      Sally and her brother try to talk the cat out of making the house a mess all of the things he is going to do. The cat is trying to entertain the two kids inside the house because it is raining. The cat is tall and is wearing a tall hat with stripes on it and is walking on his two feet. At the kids house the cat messes  everything up in the house while the kid's mother is gone. 	      The more trick's the cat pulls the more the house is messed up. They did not trust the cat because he just walked through the door and takes over. But the cat has two friends and they help the cat mess up the house. 	    People should not just let any buddy walk in there house. You need to trust people when they come in your house when your parents are not home. The mom of the two kids did not find out that the cat was in the house.	 	    The two kid's house was really messed up. The kids where thinking that to never let the cat in the house when there mom is not home or ever again. The mother of the two kids never found out that the cat was at the house and that the cat messed up the house.   
 This book basically puts forward a theory that the founders just established the Constitution for their own personal economic gain. This book is well-researched, but its premise is totally flawed. Moreover, it tries to portray all of the founding fathers as self-serving and looking out for their own economic interests. It doesn't really explain why some of the wealthiest colonists and statesmen such as George Mason and Elbridge Gerry refused to sign on. Moreover, I'd recommend that any student of the Constitution, study the writings of the framers and the Constitutional debates to answer these charges. I also recommend _The Founder's Constitution_ set, edited by Phillip Kurland and Ralph Lerner. It is an excellent tool for examining original intent. The renowned constitutional scholar, Forrest McDonald, does an excellent job introducing this book and debunking its controversial charge towards the Constitution 
 I read this book on the suggestion of Thom Hartmann, author of "The Prophet's Way", "Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight", "ADD Success Stories" and several other Great books. B. M. Hubbard has some  really good ideas, but rarely speaks from the standpoint of authority. She  uses quotes from other books an average of two times every three pages,  which gives the impression that she isn't comfortable just saying  "what is so", or she isn't sure that what she KNOWS is right. So  while the ideas are of the same caliber as other books of this kind, the  writing left me feeling like I just finished a discussion with a  proslytizing religionist, who attempts to convert other people as a  stop-gap measure for her own insecurity. I am not so naive to suggest that  no-one should read this book, as I am sure that my own personal filters  have something to do with the bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps I have missed  something that you will find 
 Really disappointed in this offering from HBR.  I was tempted to give a single star rating, but feel that someone just looking for a few cases to amuse themself may find this book suitable.  While I often purchase cases and articles from HBS, these selections are outdated and lack in shedding light on contemporary branding issues; you can get a better cross-section of cases by going directly to the case site.  I guess HBR just wanted to cash in on the 'branding' buzz- unfortunately this is no way to steward their own brand 
 If you expect another shootout-fest like ABT2, you're in for a big disapointment. Tsui Hark took over from Woo alright, but unfortunately he overdid the family values thing. This overlong film is more Drama than  Action. That would be OK for any other film, but definetely *NOT* for the  ABT series. If you want to see Yun Fat kick major behind in Vietnam, chose  the superior "Bullet In The Head". And btw, Tsui Hark did much  better with "Peking Opera Blues". Come to think of it, this is  probably his worst movie ever as a director. Still, it is not a bad film,  but 25 minutes too long and somewhat overwrought 
 This DVD set is just plain awful.  Obscure, bottom-of-the-sewer episodes replete with authentic 1950s television broadcast quality.  Avoid this purchase like the plague 
 I would give this book a zero, if it were possible...  Anyone that wants to follow this book is more than likely screwing up their child. I would consider "Doctor" Ezzo's philosophy a form of child abuse. This thing is the most awful, upsetting piece of parenting literature I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand, WHY would parents not want to go to your baby at night when he is crying?  WHAT is wrong with loving your baby, cuddles, and attending to their needs???  Oh, yeah I forgot....American parenting seems to given way to the form of training your baby like a puppy, fitting "convieniently" into your lives, with alot of distance, no empathy, No trust, little to no communication, little emotional bonding, and in the future, this results in children who have attachment problems in later life, trouble regarding relationships, and practically seem to be teaching them to be independent and self sufficient from the time they are brought home from the hospital....  How heartbreaking.   Sorry, I don't beleive in the form of abuse as this book is about. and I wish more parents felt the same as I do. 
 I can't figure out what is so special about this rice cooker so I am irritated by the price which is making me wonder if their whole product line is over priced  
 What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money 
 This book is one long whine. While I always enjoyed Bob Colacello's column in "Interview", this book, completed after Andys death (naturally), is a case of someone who, while they've outgrown their job, resents the fact that they're still there. Colacello started out worshipping Warhol, then, as often happens, began to feel he wasn't getting quite the recognition he deserved, at the same time forgetting why anyone knew who he was in the first place. Maybe the label "disgruntled employee" is too pat. But, for all his acknowledged ability to manipulate people to do things for him, it was Andy who retained the fame that many around him coveted.  Bob C. sounds like any employee of any company who complains incessently about how his boss doesn't appreciate him. The little man who feels he'll make a better big man than the big man himself, but, remains in the shadows, un-acknowledged. Wanna-be's can get ugly, but his remarks against Warhol, while hardly slanderous, are more of the nit-picking variety, revealing fairly transparent resentments right below the surface. While there are certainly two sides to every story, I always find it fairly loathsome when someone decides to cry of the injustices against them by one who can no longer reply to the accusations. Especially when said injustices are so trivial, but manage to make up a book the size of Gone With The Wind , with money, OF COURSE, just being an afterthought to the cathartic process. I also found the title, "Holy Terror", a trifle exaggerated, but I guess the alternative title of maybe "Complex Famous Artist With Contradictory Personality Flaws Just Like Everyone Else" would have been too long, not to mention that it probably would have sold less books. I certainly would'nt want my eulogy to be an exposed inventory of all the products I have in my bathroom (or BEDROOM!!), yet, the only thing Colacello can conclude his memoir with is a list of the contents of Warhols bathroom beauty products,(if he detested Andy so much, what was he doing in his bathroom, after his death??) patronizingly suggesting that these were the props that poor, shallow Andy needed daily to face the world. (Imagine image-obsessed America WITHOUT all our props...YIKES!!!)This book says more about Colacello (if anyone cared) than it ever could about Andy. If you want a perhaps more balanced view of that time period and its events, read "The Andy Warhol Diaries."  ANDYS honesty might surprise you 
 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.  This "mother" should be ashamed of herself.  So she didn't like being pregnant, so what.  I saw her interviewed on a televisions how and she was saying how she hated being pregnant because she couldn't go out anymore and got fat and that "soon after" giving birth she started going out again to try to get her old life back.  News flash, you'll never have your old life back, you're a mother now.  Why have a baby (even if it was an accident) if you're just going to keep going out and get a nanny to watch the baby?  How about talking about the joys your new baby has brought you?  Has your new baby brought you no joy?  What's the point of scaring other first time moms with your nonsense about how horrible it was being pregnant, but giving no real reasons why other than you got fat.  WAH WAH WAH!  If you didn't want to get pregnant, you should have kept your pants on!  She's a disgrace 
 I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.  Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be "sexy", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).  But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so.   Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase "your breasts are wonderful"?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties "up her crack" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).  More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a "turn-off".  Bottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is "advanced bedroom skills" (Gray said that!) that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.        
 I really liked Suzanne Summers. I've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video. When I saw her on the Today show advertising this book I couldn't wait to get it.  She promotes the Schwarzbein Principle which states that being a vegetarian is unhealthy. Suzanne has an entire chapter dedicated to someone named Wendy who after 10 years of being a vegetarian was convinced to start eating meat again! Just because Wendy's particular diet was unhealthy, that doesn't mean that all vegetarians are unhealthy. There are meat eaters that have unhealthy diets. Look at all the Hindus in India, they're lifetime vegetarians and are healthy.   I know that soy has been a controversial subject recently, but it's the pill form of soy that is questionable, soy it it's natural form is healthy for you. How can you say that soy is bad for you when millions of East Asians eat soy as part of their daily diet? I've read countless books and research that supports the benefits of soy.  I eat a balanced vegetarian diet and get all the nutrients my body needs.  Just because one doctor doesn't believe that a vegetarian diet is healthy, doesn't make it a fact. Suzanne you've really gone too far to tell everyone to stop being a vegetarian. With that misinformation in your book, I have a hard time believing that anything else is true and fact. 
 well i brough the movie 2wice the 1st time after the 1st time i seen the movie during mothers day 1 year i brough the tape 2 notice like every1 else some parts of the movie was missing then i brough the dvd yesterday and i was so upset i figure since it was the dvd that all da movie would b there and on top of that the dvd barely works its keep skipping i've cleanin it so many times only 1hr of the movie dosent skipp the movie iz good i read both the book and watched the movie i think oparah did a great job despite what ppl think i loved the movie i rather tape it off of tv then buy the movie i wonder what oparah thinks about it or does she even kno about how the dvd is i think she should all gives us working dvds with all the extra stuff once again great movie bad editing and dvd so i hope this help u out   Victoria G  Greensboro N 
 I found the  Betty Crocker cookbook for kids was limited in actual recipes. I had thought of it for my 11yr old granddaughter but when I received it I was very disappointed in fact I returned it because even for my 7 year old grandson it was too basic. The recipes were things they already cooked. Way too much reading and too little recipes. Not a great job from Betty Crocker 
 If you are looking for a "feel good" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues. For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most "Do what you love" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick apart other chapters in the same manner 
 Band Camp was funny, but not as good as the first two American Pie movies. It was, however, on par with the third movie in the series. There were the usual silly, outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies, but not the main characters. This movie was fun and worth watching, but probably not really worth watching again EXCEPT for the the language features. The movie comes dubbed in Spanish and French, plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language. SO, this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills 
 The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds.   My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you 
 I am an Ismailli and totally offended by Lewis's book.  He is no doubt a total anti-Muslim racist.  For greater information on the Nizari ismaillis read Farhad Daftar 
 I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER.

 Preparing cow brains and eels might be simple for some, but most will find this a very impractical guide to French cooking. "Pretentious French Food," would be a more appropriate title 
 I am a big fan of non-fiction adventure stories, and bought this book based on the advice from this board.   The book is basically a yawner.  SPOILER COMING:  Nothing happens.  I kept waiting for either the adventure or the humor.  Needless to say, I played the part of the jilted reader.  If you read this book, your response will be:  "what's the big deal, I could have done that."  I think Tim's motivation for this book was solely cash (nothing wrong with that - just warn me first).  It was clearly written out of contractual obligation and not because he truly had something to say 
 The authors of this book touch on many subjects, giving very little detail in any of them.  The legal and accounting loopholes are very basic - and they keep referring you to other products and sites they've written/published - making this book one big commercial.  In one area, when talking about the benefits of real estate investment, the fail to even mention costs associated with using equity, cash flow, repairs, etc.  I am a new entrant to real estate investing, and would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is no different than the get rich quick schemes you see on tv/internet 
 I had to struggle to keep reading this book. The plot is good, but the writing is so overdone, it was hard to get through. Every utterance is characterized by the author, rather than letting the character's words let us know what's going on with them. People never just "say" or "ask," they "philosophize," "blurt," "snap." It seems they are all over-caffeinated and under-medicated. It also seems that somewhere along the way, Nussbaum heard of the Ciceronian Triplet. Unfortunately, he didn't learn to use it sparingly. He often ends a sentence with three adjectives to provide emphasis. The effect works once or twice, maybe. Also, the whole "fate" theme is a bit heavy handed, but I've never been much into that idea 
 I disagree with one of the other reviewers that we didn't want to learn more about Micah. I was really hoping that we would see more of Micah than his werekitty persona and hair.  Alas, this book uses Micah rather than discusses him. I really like most of the Anita Blake books, but this one is tedious; don't buy it; gosh, don't even borrow it from the library. Too much bad semi-porn, too much formula writing as though Ms Hamilton had left her computer on auto and returned a day later to mail off what the computer had prepared.  Let's put it this way. I don't even remember the plot. Hmmm. maybe there wasn't one?  Micah COULD be an exciting character, but the non-dimensional descriptions of his trauma and  problems are not it. Let' hope the next book is back to the fun "trash" we've grown to love. Sorry, Ms Hamilton 
 Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience 
 I found the book heavy-going. Points are hammered home and I could not help wishing the book were much shorter. I do not think I as a reader would have lost much if there had been less detail. 
 Suffice it to say, this text is awful, an arduous task to understand and conceptualize.  I'm taking a lower level geography course with this book as the primary text and find myself ready to punch a wall when attempting to read 
 It's not quite fair to describe Rosenbaum's latest book as a novel.  It actually reads much more like an essay.  This is a message book...Rosenbaum has a rather heavy-handed message that he is bent on delivering.  There is a tremendous lack of depth or realness in the characters and the plot is overly contrived and uninvolving.  The reason is simply that the characters are only devices Rosenbaum uses to further communicate his message.  Indeed, the characters are anything but fully fleshed out (no pun intended)...they as well as everything about this book exists for the sole purpose of preaching.  Very uninvolving.  The message itself is educational and somewhat interesting, but buyer beware - this is an overlong essay...not a novel 
 This Scooby-Doo VHS is ABSOULTY HORRIBLE!! It lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the Scooby-Doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises...too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like....Plus its higher cost I paid 9.95 TRUST ME BUY Scooby-Doo 2 or Scooby-Doo Cyber Chase Those keep the kids glued to the T.V. very exciting Just the way we want Scooby Doo to be!! 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked "Of Human Bondage."  I know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature?  Not only did I find it dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women!  I'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways.  "Yellow teethed"  "Sallow skin"  "Dirty Hands"  "Tear stained over powdered face", it goes on and on.  I wondered if the author was uncomfortable women?  I looked online for some information about Maugham.  To my surprise I found out that Maugham was bisexual.  He did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.    Instead of this book I'd recommend the following classics:  Beautiful and Damned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Madame Bovary by Flaubert.  At least in these books, maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.   
 I bought this CD without having first heard it. I was shopping for some new music so I decided to take a chance with "Life in Dreaming." I was quite horrified while listing to this CD. It's quite awful. The worst.   In the 1990s I used to dog Bush (the band) and Creed for being unoriginal. But at least Creed and Bush could write good, catchy songs, even if they were posers and trend-followers. Hidden In Plain View has no good redeeming qualities at all. The music is not only totally unoriginal, it's boring and uninspired. The album is one big mess of totally bland, recycled riffs and dull solos. The album is quite redundant and monotonous. But what makes it completely unlistenable is lead singer Joe Reo. He has no vocal ability and his delivery is quite whiny and irritating.  Hidden In Plain View is so awful it makes me nostalgic for the days of Creed and Limpbizkit (and that's saying something!)  This band represents everything wrong with music today. They are poster children for the generic crappy rock that dominates radio today. They are like the Winger, Slaughter or Trixter of the 00s 
 This book could easily be cut in half. It rambles in so many areas -- going into mind-numbing detail about unimportant subjects. Don't waste your tim 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 I thought this book was fine. I like the book. This book is a neat book 
 I was expecting a book that showed me where phi exists, not one that shows me where it doesn't exist.  I agree that Dan Brown must not have read the book before endorsing it.  There are some interesting points and the last couple of chapters are the best, but all in all I'm disappointed 
 Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.  I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.  It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.  Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did) 
 I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA.  AFTER READING DR. MOLDWIN'S BOOK MY HUSBAND DROVE US TO SEE HIM IN NEW YORK BECAUSE I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN I JUST WANTED TO DIE. IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT 2 MONTHS TO GEY AN APPOINTMENT.  HE EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME EXACTLY WANT TO DO TO GET BETTER, CAUSE IC PATIENTS ARE ALL DIFFERENT.  I AM 100% CURED.  MY OTHER DOCTORS CANNOT BELIEVE IT. 100% CURED.  WITH PRAYERS AND FOLLOWING WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO AFTER A YEAR IN PAIN 24 HOURS A DAY, I AM NOW PAIN FREE! 
 This book was dreadful.  The author fails to flesh out the premise of the book--the title--and instead goes off on a series of tangents and non sequitirs.  Perhaps this book wouldn't have been so unsatisfying if the author had been more honest with its contents.   This is hardly a story of some great gamble taken by Jefferson.   Jefferson is at best a minor character in the story, and his infleuence is never credibly substantiated.  Even the "good" parts--those dealing with Livingston--seem to lack any sort of conviction.   Basically this book is series of partially interesting character portraits sandwiched by completely misleading introductory and closing chapters.  I can find no other way to say it than this book was very poorly written and was a huge disappointment 
 If you're a big fan of the Frank Peretti novels such as "Piercing the Darkness", you might enjoy this story of evil, demons and semi-Biblical themes. As a Christian, I found the parallels to the Bible to be interesting, but not compelling. In fact, these parallels were the only thing that kept me reading. In creating this work of fiction, Meyers goes well beyond the biblical descriptions of events-and this is fine. The problem I found was that Meyer's writing style is a bit annoying. It seemed like everything was measured in yards-the truck was getting closer and closer, 20 yards, 17 yards, 13 yards, and so on. It just didn't ring true with me. Meyers is fond of telling us that tears "burn" the eyes of his characters. And there are elements of the plot that seem contrived to add to the story. Sarah, a research scientist at a parapsychology lab drives an old car with a bad carburator. A single woman with a high-paying job would fix it or replace the car; she wouldn't put her safety in jeopardy. But Sarah is "too into her work". Even after the bad guy attacks her and her car fails to start when she tries to run away, she still drives the thing. In fact, the very next day she's giving her boss a long ride out in the country in it-even though her boss has a fancy car back in the parking lot. Another nail in the coffin is that even though Sarah's attacker's identity is known nobody calls the police. This leaves him free to commit more crimes that add to the story. And it goes on.   I'm afraid that Christians desperate for this kind of literature will artificially inflate the popularity of this book. It's really not a high-quality work 
 Douglas Trumbull had a very good idea and a clever way to maximize his uber-expensive FX shots with the mousetrap that is Brainstorm. Unfortunately, the film is anything but brainy and doesn't follow any compelling storyline. In fact, it turns into a new-agey 1980s lovefest by the end.  Basically the first third of the film does a fairly competent job of portraying the drama of a corporate lab that has just reached a tremendous technological breakthrough. Notice how I do not say scientific -- for there is woefully little of that in this film. The second third dances around some metaphysical issues related to tapping into the brain but none of these episodes goes anywhere or tackles the issue philisophically. It evinces a mock-luddite cautionary stance instead.  But where things really go bad is when the film decides to turn into a thriller in the last third -- with of course (as always) the United States military as the evil villain. Christopher Walken's motivations become increasingly muddled and the entire film just falls apart in front of your eyes. As usual with Trumbull, the optical effects are jaw-dropping fabulous, for the 2-3 minutes they are on screen. Just keep the guy away from a typewriter 
 I realize that by writing this review I'll probably have a fatwa issued against me by the comic book fan community, but this graphic novel was a major disappointment.  I came to it because I liked the movie so much.  I found it to be misogynistic and tedious to read (entire paragraphs of text repeated, as if the writer couldn't think of enough to fill out his story).  The artwork was ugly.  The plot lines were sometimes hard to swallow, characters' motivations not believable.  It was the spark of a great idea that the movie producer(s) turned into something excellent 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 The stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner. Though it is well organised it lacks clear representation. It looks like linux man-pages are explained in an organised manner. Could be used as a reference book, but not for learning 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope 
 It has been several years since I read this, but there are many small problems in this book. Most people will not know the difference, but I will not recommend it to anyone who wants to portray accuracy 
 This film does not come close to the quality of Once Upon a Time in China. First of all, the plot is weak, it does not have the kind of power that the original of this series did. The characters in this film seem like they are out of a comic book, while the characters in the first film were interesting and complex. The kungfu is mostly unrealistic wirework, and while Once Upon a Time in China had some of this, the emphasis was on realistic martial arts. In the original, the main characters were trying to resist the influence of the West which was destroying their culture, but in this version, the main characters are actually on the side of the Westerners and they are fighting their own people! There is no explanation of why Wong Fei Hung and his crew would side with the people who were their enemies in the last film. One of the reasons the original film was so good, was because it was about brave Chinese patriots trying to protect their culture, but in this film is seems as though they have switched sides 
 The Buddha didn't want to be worshipped and no reliable historical account of him exists. The whole book is speculation. If you want to study buddhism read a book about buddhism not this book 
 If it were possible, I would give a negative star rating for this book.  To sum it all up in one sentence, Carol (an extreme left-wing animal rights/environmentalist/Feminazi propagandist and a New Age crystal-squeezer to boot) actually claims that eating meat is equivalent and related to abusing women!  I can just see the eco-cops outside my kitchen window with guns drawn "SIR, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE CHEESEBURGER!!".  Never once in her book does she consider the obvious fact that meat has always been a normal part of the human diet in the vast majority of cultures, and that maybe, just maybe, people (including women) eat meat simply because it tastes good.  But then it's typical for the more extreme feminists to be so out of touch with reality that they see nefarious male-oriented political motivations in even the most innocent of human behavior 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 This item is billed as "The Best Of " Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word"Best"here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word"Best" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the"best" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like..."Best"...as in The"best"manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's "Best" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe "best" as in IT WOULD BE "BEST"TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word "best"that is appropriate.... 
 Disclaimer:  I only read selections from this book!  I was interested in looking through this book because 1.) people have told me it is good and 2.) I thought Blue like Jazz was terrible and cannot understand why people like his writting so much.   With that in mind I purused a copy of my friends and not surprisingly found it just as underwhelming.    The writing is getting better.  The "insights" into life, while highly personal and occationally compelling, are shallow and obvious.  It is like being at a Sunday sermon where the pastor preaches a moving speach, but upon reflection you realize it was just another homily.  Spend the time you would be reading this book doing something much more constructive - like reading and reflecting on the bible itself 
 I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera. It takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. It is quite compact and has a nice screen. The software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface.  Why 2 stars? Ok here's the bad stuff:  1) In the first shipment I got, the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. The images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. The ultra-wide images were fine. I attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. The second V570 I got from Amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. So, I don't think it is just a random problem. There appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that I would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. My V570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and I use a Casio Exilim EX-Z70.   2) The stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. You have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. Also, since you have to charge the battery in the camera, you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. For comparison, my new Casio EX-Z70 has a USB cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. So, if one battery is dead I can leave it behind in the charger while I take pictures with the spare.  3) The movies that you take with this camera are stored in MOV format instead of AVI or MPEG. While it does play in most PCs if you have installed Quicktime, it is not supported by my streaming media player (D-Link DSM-320RD) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/DVD creator SW I use (Sonic MyDVD). I can't say how widely MOV is supported compared to AVI and MPEG, but that format created problems for me.  So, I applaud Kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. But I think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
  I do not recommend this book!!! I took so long to finish it. Do not read it. You will fall asleep in minutes!!!!!! 
 Please don't confuse this Read To Me series with other Thomas the Tank books.  For instance, Catch me, Catch me is called a Pictureback Reader, and although it is meant for 4 or 5 year olds to learn how to read, my 21 month old loves it--the extremely simple text is all her attention span can take.  The Cranky Day, however, has a lot of writing and is meant for the longer attention spans of 3 or 4 plus year olds.  I don't like the tiny photos for pictures where the text takes up just as much room as the photos, and I agree with another reviewer that the photos are dark.  The full page drawings in Catch Me Catch Me are much better, as are the simplistic drawings in Thomas the Tank Engines Big Blue Treasury. Depends upon the age of the child I guess, when it comes to selecting Thomas books!  
 I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.  It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.  The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.  Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.  This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.    Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.     
 NO REAL ANALYSIS, UNSUBSTANSIATED, TOO MUCH HYPE AND SELF PRAISE. NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE TRADER KNOWS ALREADY BY EXPERIENCE. JUST A INTERESTING OBSERVATION, NO RIGOROUS PROOF, OF NO REAL PRACTICAL USE 
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a huge Munch fan and likes this one well enough, but it's my least favourite.  She tends to memorize books and quote them constantly, and I'm not thrilled with the "hey, you dumb...." mantra.  This is kind of minor, but how was it that the pigs showed up at school after Megan locked them back in at home? If you're wanting to add to your Munch collection, he's written better.  Alligator Baby and Thomas's Snowsuit are fun without the insults and a little more logically consistent 
 While life may not scare me, the pictures in this book did.  Perhaps had I been familiar with Basquiat's work I would not have ordered the book in the first place.  But I also thought the poem was a bit oversold by some of the other reviews I read. The poem itself is only a few lines long, while the book is more like 20 pages or so.  Several more pages are taken up with bios of Angelou and Basquiat. Mainly, the pictures are ugly and seem to me to be completely unaccessible to a child 
 Holism and Evolution by Jan Christiaan Smuts, originally published in 1926, is one of the great and authentic visionary classics of the 20th century, and I highly recommend to anyone interested in the subject of holism, evolution, and integral philosophy. This book is not only one of the harbingers of today's holistic and integral movements but also continues to provide us with deep insights and powerful inspirations.    However, this edition with Sanford Holst's editing is an insult to the original author and an insult to the intelligence of the readers. Holst adds subheadings and summaries that are utterly unnecessary while changing some words to make them "understandable" to the contemporary readers, which is insulting to the intelligence and linguistic knowledge of the readers.     Therefore, my recommendation is to read the original book sold by Amazon.com, but not this edition by Sanford Holst, if the reader wants to enjoy an experience of reading a book by one of the truly great minds, without a contamination by the hubris of a mediocre mind.    
 This book is good for a quick overview of some valuation methods, but I found it to be a little too simplified, although it's not bad for mom-and-pop retail and service businesses. If you are actually don't going to do the calculations and want more professional results, take a look at "Unlocking the Value of Your Business". 
 okay, I know some readers gave this 5 stars but I was rather disappointed with the photo's in this book considering the price.  The pics to me were quite small generally. Additionally, there are only photo's for a few of the plants described. Most of the entries had no illustrations at all. In other words, let's say there are an average of 4-6 plants described for each 2 page spread, {left and right}, there might be one, very infrequently two, very small, washed out looking photos for only one out of all the plants listed on that page. Also, I have to say that the pictures in general were not only small but they also seemed like they were very old; ie.. rather like drab pics from someone's 1964 honeymoon in Hawaii. For what are incredibly colorful and dramatic plants, these small pictures seemed almost monochromatic! {and considering the subject matter I would consider this an almost criminal offense !!}. Sorry to be so critical but there it is; this is actually the first book I have ever had to return that I bought from Amazon and the first book put out by Timber Press that I was not utterly thrilled with. Normally Timber Pr. can be counted on for really fantastic stuff.  In fact they have a few other titles that cover the same material much better than this. I highly recommend you take a look at those before you fork over the $'s for this one. My apologies to the author 
 Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU 
 I bought this CD completely on the back of these rave reviews without previewing it, and while I don't regret the purchase, I cannot see what the fuss about it. Back in the early 90s, this stuff may have been quite amazing, but in 2004, it sounds plain dated. It has the production, but no energy. 1st track is great, but the rest of the album pretty much washes over me.... I am big fan of this genre of music, and really gave this album a try, but to my dissapointment, it just bores me 
 I spend top dollars for this piece of crap. Wanted something to save weight, and time, so I don't have to carry everything around with me to school. But it was DOA (Dead on arrival) Should have spend the money on a cheaper notebook cooler. But as always Amazon was there to the rescue. And Tiger-direct refunded my money the next day. 
 Piece of junk.  I used it for 4-5 months without incident, but it always ran hot, not warm, HOT.   I came down one morning and the KVM switch was so hot it burned my hand.  Went to check my computer and found the KVM literally fried my MS keyboard and MS optical mouse (on PS2 adapter) - keyboard dead - MS mouse had a MELT MARK underneath (no joke!).    Thier tech support is overseas (ergo: terrible), I sat on hold forever trying to get an RMA.  All I really wanted was to make them aware that this switch is possibly a manufacturer defect, and quite possibly a fire hazard.  They claim no one ever called to complain about it before.  Amazon's review section proved them wrong, and I told her so.  I went with an IOGEAR KVM switch at half the price.  If that one dies I'm going with a hard wired KVM box for more money intead of these 'all in one' switch units, I think it'll be worth the piece of mind since I use my computers for a living at home.  I can't take the risk some junky cable could destroy my livelihood while I sleep.  Linksys claims they never heard any issues with this unit overheating or melting down components, but if you search the web you'll find lots of "my computer will not post, connected to Linksys KVM switch."  This thing is overpriced garbage and a fire hazard as far as I'm concerned.  Avoid cheaply made overpriced junk like this 
 I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP 
 I saw the Blue Lagoon when I was 13 it was risque, the acting was not the best but Brooke was a top model and Chris was gorgeous,I didn't even know that a second movie had been made. I was shopping came across it and bought it thinking, "wow part 2 maybe they survived and finally made it do san frocisco". Boy was I disappointed, Milla is gorgeous she makes Brooke look like and ugly stepsister, Bruce although not as handsome as Chris looked ok. But the acting just like the first was horrible. This movie was made just to show off some young hot bodies. It's a rip off of the original but done with less artistic integrity. At least the first movie was gorgeous, pure you felt as if the two kids were truely discovering themselves and each other. This one they are just reading lines from a page. Why was this made 
 This film tells a story about LaSalle Parish in Louisiana (and by extension the rest of America). Sheriff Darryl is shown handling the rigors of his job. Oddly, he carries no pistol - a symbol of lacking something? A truck overturns on a curve, and spills its load of shoes. The poor people show up to carry off their free shoes, recalling that scene in Charles Dickens "Tale of Two Cities". Then a dead body is found, and this scandal should be censored, says the political boss and judge. Sheriff Darryl is visited by an exotic dancer who reports her husband is missing (after dancing at a private club). The rest of the film tells how the murder was solved.  The language and contents of this film would have been banned prior to the 1990s. While "realistic" about the lost souls it portrays, it seems to have no redeeming social values. Yes, it gives a view to politics and personalities not usually seen in films, and which can educate the viewers. The film does not mention the corporations (like Big Oil) that dominated the politics of Louisiana, and other states. We see how the Twin-Party System meets at the top to accomplish its missions. Like in a small county, the heads of the opposing parties meet to divide the spoils. In this film the Governor loses an election. Was he too clean? So a new Administration takes office, and life goes on unchanged. There are some winners and loser, but that's the way the ball bounces. Blaming a small businessman who has a claim against the county seems too cynical. 
 This movie suck...first the comedy is not even funny, they'll do anything to make you laugh. The acting is horrible, the fight scene suck, none of these actor know how to fight. Princess Phoenix is the most annoying person in the world. Avoid this movie at all cost 
 This book is very small and the text is very tiny. Don't really simplify solution to get a better understanding 
 Dit 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 I am a professor at a school in Indiana, and I checked this book out with the hope of using it in my class. But this book is utterly loaded with error and blatant non-facts. For example, all one has to do is open the book to the first page of chapter 1, and you see the authors informing the readers that vaccines are required by government law. As most anti-vaccine researchers know, this is a blatant non-fact, and there is no such law, and not a single state in the United States has such laws. Rather, it is schools that give the false impression that there is such a law, and schools are used to badger parents into getting vaccines, and they incorrectly state that there is such a law, which there is not. There are numerous other problems with this book also. First of all, it is a pro-vaccine book, recommending that parents merely wait (until after toddlerhood) rather than reject vaccines--as if vaccines might hopefully be somewhat safe enough later on, after toddlerhood. This book plainly does not properly address the severity of what vaccines do to people before, during, and after toddlerhood (through adulthood and old age). And regardless of age, this book overlooks the fact that vaccines are filled with poisons harmful or lethal to anyone, and which have been verified to cause all sorts of ailments and diseases--anything from early onset Alzheimer's to eczema to allergies to numerous auto-immune disorders to diabetes to cancer, and that is just the very beginning of what vaccines do.  Reading this book gives the impression that vaccines may work, could be safe, do not necessarily cause epidemics rather than eliminate them, and that they are not seriously dangerous for kids after toddlerhood. All one needs to do is research the data that other doctors, such as Viera Schreibner, have uncovered from the professional journals, to see that this is simply incorrect. Parents should be very careful whether they want to trust this book, rather than a different one. I recommend the scientific research by Tenpenny, and her book, titled: VACCINES 
 Heidi Klum has so much personality and spunk and none of it found its way to the pages of this book.  I was mildly disappointed, I was hoping for the best.  Her current job - as host and executive producer of Project Runway on Bravo networks is brilliant, where is any of that in this book?  I was so bored I ended up reading her book in less than thirty minutes.  The pictures are fun to see and her lists of what to do in order to be a model may be helpful to those looking for that type of insight.  I was looking for a refreshed interpretation of a model's life. On the bright side, it is  better than Paris Hilton's book 
 I first picked up on the Anita Blake series a little over a year ago. I was absolutely enthralled. Not only was the main character witty, intelligent, and kick-butt, but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through. Who can forget Zerbrowski's antics (even in the worst of times) or the cold-hearted killing of everyone's favorite bounty hunter? After reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on Amazon, I am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are: what happened?  I just finished Narcissus in Chains. Normally when I finish a book, I'm left with a sense of fulfillment, like I've accomplished something. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I've always found this series to capture me from the get-go, but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard. Not only was the plot rather weak, but Anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over. Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, and even Asher seem to plague her thoughts. And although she will do anything to save a member of her pard, or anyone else for that matter, her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys. And did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing? Hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book. Unlike the earlier part of the series, the writing in Narcissus in Chains is less imaginative and less memorable. On top of it all, come the end of the book, we have this bad guy who I can't even remember where he came from in the first place!  My favorite part of the books has always been Anita's police work. I am honestly ten times more interested in her career than I am in her love life. I miss having a tight, intense plot that flows, instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span. And as pointed out in the book, the charming Anita Blake we used to know and love really has become a monster. A literary disaster of a monster.  Although the reviews for Cerulean Sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for Narcissus in Chains, I plan to go ahead and continue the series. I can't give up on something that has such great potential, and from the sound of it, this next one has a more recognizable plot. I can only hope. Unfortunately, I believe that Obsidian Butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
 It's very rare a book is so bad I cannot even bring myself to finish it. 100 pages into this clunker, I thought, "Life's too short to force myself to finish this book."   The premise is ridiculous [even though as a lawyer myself, I actually ended up dating my opposing counsel near the end of a law suit]; the dialogue is worse than people in my first year fiction class came up with; and the characters are forgettable.  I have read other Brad Meltzer books, and usually they are a fast, entertaining read. This is a real loser. I bought it thinking it was relatively new before I realized it had been written a few years ago, early in Meltzer's career.  For those looking for a thrilling, well-written read for the beach or an airplane flight, I recommend you check out the author Harlan Coben, who I recently discovered, and just love. 
 I seriously hope that the price tag I am seeing is ($7,000+) is a mistake.. 
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!   
 I saw this movie in the mid-80s at a porno theatre on a double bill w/ The Decline of Western Civilization.An interesting experience-all through the movies middle aged men would furtively enter,watch the screen for 10-15 minutes and go to the other theatre.I'm not sure that they didn't have the right idea. There are,indeed, wonderful clips of live Clash,a wonderful band. But most of the movie follows the mind numbing adventures of a moron who somehow falls into a job as a roadie for the Clash.The band members themselves later largely disavowed the movie and it isn't hard to understand why.I am a rabid Clash fan,but there's no way that I could justify paying the price for this movie just to watch 15-20 minutes of the Clash.It is a tragedy that this band,one of the most exciting bands in the history of rock,doesn't yet have a good concert film. Joe Strummer's death may cause the surviving band members to go through the archives to put together a documentary that shows the band performing live.Until that happens I guess this is better than nothing, but not much. Mick? Paul? Do you read these reviews? Your fans deserve better that this! Whip out a real concert movie 
 Okay, I'll admit that by the time I got around to reading Winter's Tale, the book was already suffering from a fatal dose of overhype; I must have heard twenty or thirty fairly literate people wax rhapsodical about the thing over the years, several of whom claimed that it was the greatest book they had ever read.  Still, hearing rave reviews of Shakespeare, Dickens, Ellison, Grass, Vonnegut, Hemingway, etc. never stopped me from appreciating genius when I experienced it for myself.  Helprin, while clearly a gifted writer (a phrase that most reviewers use to describe him), is no genius, and the best thing I can say about Winter's Tale is that I get the sense that it took him a long time to write it.  The main problem for me is that the lengthy descriptive passages always feel overwrought and pretentious, like a hammy performance by an otherwise talented actor.  I dislike being aware of the writing process while I am actually reading someone's work, and Helprin never lets me forget that I am in smack dab in the middle of a book that insists it is a magnum opus--that is an unpardonable sin, as far as I am concerned.  Gunter Grass, whose genius I mention above, somehow manages to convince me that all his outrageous stylization is actually some sort of stream of consciousness, and via translation, no less.  Shakespeare is famous for making blank verse sound like natural dialogue.  Helprin, as his admirers are fond of pointing out, is intoxicated with language, but whatever his skills, he isn't capable of passing that intoxication along to all of his readers. Hey, I love energetic verbal ingenuity as much as anyone I know, but I am not a language whore.  So, while I do acknowledge that Winter's Tale is capable of captivating a huge audience, it nevertheless lacks the universality that I expected it to possess based on its reputation.  And, after reading some of the other reviews here, I can see that I am not alone.  If I had to rate it strictly on my own appreciation of its merits, I would give Winter's Tale a half of a star.  That I give it two stars is merely my acknowledgement of the fact that appreciating fiction is largely a matter of taste.  But true literary genius is not 
 Harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be, and I was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end....and found out there was nothing.  Just a worthless rant 
 This book is mediocre at best. It offers invalid practice tests and too broad of a summary on each thing. It doesnt pinpoint what is on the Ap exam very well at all. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. The best resource is the textbook by Miller. When i bought this book, it took 3 weeks for delivery and is more expensive then other publishers such as barrons and princeton review. I knew that these small unknown publishers would not meet up with my expectations and         i though i was proved wrong with these miraculous reviews. Trust me, you wouldnt be a "smarty pants" if you buy this book. 
 Curious about how a biography of Anna Nicole could hit the shelves even before the body got cold, I flipped through this book at a local store yesterday. "Oh my god" comes immediately to mind, and stays there. I came away with the distinct impression that "Train Wreck" -- although it lamely pretends to portray the life of Anna Nicole -- is really a thinly veiled autobiography of her stupid and incredibly self-aggrandizing half-sister. Donna, take it from me... nobody even knew you existed before you cranked out this foul piece of offal, and now the people who know, hate your guts. The ONLY value this book has is as a reminder of how shallow, insipid and self-centered some people can be 
 This(and other Cooking Light books)definately need a better way to organize the recipes. The book doesn't even follow the order of the monthly magazines recipes. It is severely lacking in photographs. Most of the beautiful photos from the magazines are not used in the cookbook. The photos would be helpful in selecting recipes...especially because the book is not organized by food category.  The recipes might be great, but who has 2 hours to search through a cookbook to find something to cook? 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 I liked Ocean's Eleven but this movie was just ridiculous.  Someone seemed to think that if you get enough big celebrities in one place and try to make it "stylish" you'll have a good film.  Unfortunately, the plot, dialogue, and even the internal logic of the plot is just poorly done.  The clever banter isn't clever.  The plot is slow and dull.  And without giving too much away (although you really should pass on this movie!) there is a plot twist involving the Julia Roberts character that is so ridiculous as to be arrogant.  Overall, a terrible film and a terrible waste of everybody's time 
 I am disappointed to have bought this book.  More judgmental than analytical, the author clearly has an agenda and presents many one-sided arguments in support of it, resulting in numerous rhetorical fouls (e.g. completely ignoring the important distinction between statistical correlation and causation) in addition to complete dismissal of basic economic tenets.  The statistics presented are quite unidimensional and are given with opinion frequently presented as fact.  After conventional attacks on the very real problems of CEO salary levels and increasing gaps between our nation's very rich and very poor, the book takes a turn for the surreal.  To whit, while questioning salary differentiation between different types of medical specialists: "While we allow ourselves to be entranced by the mysteries of medicine, none of us really knows whether orthopedic surgery is any more complicated than overhauling a transmission.  We know that police officers deliver babies with no ill effects, and on at least one occasion, a submarine corpsman has performed a successful appendectomy.  Much of medicine now depends on high-tech equipment, which most of us wouldn't know how to plug in.  As it happens, doctors are just as baffled by it."  The author offers this passage and many like it without trace of irony, satire, or devil's advocacy.  If you are the type to argue that we will run out of a natural commodity in XX years by linearly projecting today's consumption rate into the future while ignoring the impact of increasing scarcity on prices and economic viability of substitutions (and therefore decreased demand levels and consumption rates), then this book is for you 
 I am 40 years old and have been a sci-fi fan for at least 24 years. I read an average of 2-3 books per week (not all sci-fi). I held off reading Sirens because I like to read humorous sci-fi on vacations (just my quirk). I can honestly say I was extremely dissappointed in this story, and I think most real sci-fi fans will be as well. I think people are afraid to criticize this book anymore because it is so widely praised, but if they were honest, it's a mixed bag at best.  Some spoilers ahead...be warned.  Vonnegut makes a lot of promises early on in this novel that he never fulfills. The experience becomes much ado about nothing. I understand some people are absolutely engaged by Vonnegut's exploration of the human condition and the pathos involved, but it all came off trite to me. There are other novels by Herbert and Heinlein that do it much better. Deserting main charachters on park benches to die isn't really exploring the human condition as much as admitting you led the reader down a path with no destination.    His fade-in, fade-out antoginist really is lacking in depth. He's a stereotypical WASP we are supposed to like because he is destroying all those dogmatic religions by creating a new...(suprise) a new dogmatic religion. It's like Vonnegut thinks he's the only one to ever conclude that religion might be holding back humanity, but then has no idea how to fix it and in the end sticks to convention. This plot point ends up a huge wash to me.  Of course the most annoying plot point right on top of the cake is the promise of this magical destination Titan and the title's Sirens. We are shown their picture, which is supposed to be beauty beyond compare, but never a description. In the end they are just statues on a barren landscape, yet another cop-out.   In the end we discover that the point of humanity's entire maddening history has been to provide a part for a broken alien spaceship. Of course, one would expect that part to be complicated enough that it required such manipulation and effort. One might even suspect that it was too hard for a single alien to make. Not here. It's hard to suspend disbelief about a piece of ribbon steel 1 inch wide and 6 inches long with a square hole punched in it. It apparently required 20,000 years of human history to produce it, instead of the alien using a coke can or some analog on his elaborate ship.  There are some creative bits to this story. The trip to Mercury definitely was well done. Unfortunately the humor and creativity feel like unrelated bits strung together along one of the worst plot lines ever created. I really wanted to like this book. I really wanted to recommend it. I can't. If you like books with solid plots, some sci-fi, some religion, some philosophy about the human condition, and interesting charachters, go read Stranger in a Strange Land again.  
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 I have read and enjoyed many Cussler books, and though this one was mildly entertaining it was way out there as far the plot goes. If you haven't read Cussler before don't let this be your first, there are many more that are much better 
 Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, "Talk of Angels" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest 
 It puzzles me why this book got published in the first place.  Maybe it holds some interest for the digital photography historian who has twenty bucks to throw away.  Every single bit of information in this book can be found, for free, at dpreview.com.  You can also find all the information at dcresource.com, imaging-resource.com, or pcphotoreview.com.  (Any one of these sites would do, so you don't have to dig among all these sties.)  This book is meant to be a survey of the current crop of digital SLRs.  (Fixed-lens digital cameras are not covered.)  Even though the copyright year is 2005, it's already way out of date.  To be fair, any such book will have little current value as the state of the d-SLR market changes rapidly.  For example, the very important Nikon D70 is NOT covered in this book.  Nor is the smallish but capable Pentax *ist DS.  (The websites I listd above do cover these cameras, in lots of details.)  The omission of the D70 is a HUGE mistake, as that camera is important for being a full-featured d-SLR that sells at a consumer price point (unlike the feature-crippled Canon EOS Digital Rebel).  This book is totally disappointing and holds no value whatsoever 
 This is perhaps the worst book I've ever read. Dershowitz is a fundamentalist when interpreting the Bible. Therefore, he assumes that each and every story happened just as the Bible relates it. Since this is a severe improbability, if not impossibility, the whole premise of the book is incorrect. From this, Dershowitz makes the argument that God is not omniscient, omnipotent, or even capable of making just decisions. He argues that God is fallible and that it is our responsibility to "call" God on His injustices. Had I understood this was the angle of the book, I would have never picked it up in the first place. Overall, it was a monumental waste of time because the book does not contain any new or useful information, much less any interesting viewpoints 
 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates.  For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers?  When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?  This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.  This book is supposed to be a "Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.  I was VERY disappointed with this book 
 I'm a student at Williams College and I previewed what the book said about my school, through the "Look inside the book feature." This book says Williams has 1,200 undergrads which is completely wrong. We have about 2,100 undergrads. Being 75% off about a school's size is not good. I dont know if there are other factual errors but based on the Williams entry, I would assume so 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it. 
 A CRITICAL REVIEW OF RICHARD WHITE'S  THE MIDDLE GROUND  By Jeff Hendricks  Richard White. The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991.     Richard White's The Middle Ground is a detailed and extensive study of the inter-relationships between various European colonists and the Native American tribes they encountered in the Great Lakes reigon of the current United States from 1650 to 1815. The study traces the development of what Richard White argues was a "middle ground" of cultural accomodation that was created as a result of  these encounters.  The whole of White's book is dedicated to proving his "middle ground" argument.    At the beginning of White's study, he creates a category that lumps together the Native Americans of the Great Lakes region, known as the pays d'en haut, into a grouping that he refers to as the Algonquins.  The Algonquins were an assortment of tribes from various areas surrounding the pays d'en haut who had been forced together into the region due to warfare in the east.   White's study begins with descriptions of  the brutal and murderous situation taking place in the pays d'en haut as the various factions of the Algonquins engaged in inter-village warfare amongst themselves, as well as war against the Iroquoi federation, which had been attacking the region from the east.  In addition to these inter-tribal wars, the Algonquins living in the region were also forced to deal with the French colonists, who had begun to enter the pays d'en haut in order to profit from the fur trade.  The entrance of the French traders into the region set in motion the events that would eventually lead to the formation of White's "middle ground."    White argues that the middle ground begins to form slowly, as the French colonists insert themselves into the day to day happenings of the pays d'en haut and work to achieve a position in the area that will allow them to carry on trade with the Algonquins.  White shows how, in order to achieve a profitable trade situation, the French quickly realize that they need to bring the inter-tribal warfare to a hault - or at the least reduce it enough to permit trade to occur. In their attempts at building a trading realtionship with the Algonquins, the French realized that the Algonquins' social system differed greatly from their own.  The French were products of a hierarchal society, and from that society they had been conditioned to see obedience and respect as things that were gained through force.  When the French tried to impose their own notions of social order on the Algonquins, who lived in a collective based non-hierarchal society, they soon realized that they would have to accommodate and negotiate with the Algonquins to form a profitable trade relationship with them. Simply brutalizing the Algonquins into submission was not going to work.  For the Algonquins, brutality did not breed submission - it bred resistance.     Another obstacle that the French encountered in their trade with the Algonquins was the differentiation between their respective economic systems.  To put it simply, Algonquin economics were based on need, whereas French economics were based on excess accumulation and profit.  The Algonquins were not accustomed to exploitative economic relations and thus resisted any type of trade that they did not view as meeting the needs of both parties involved.  The French, on the other hand, could not understand an economic system based on mutual aid and cooperation.  In order to push past this cultural/economic barrier to relations, the French had to create a system of trade that the Algonquins could view as a mutual exchange of gifts rather than a purely economic exchange of material for private profit.      The story of the formation of the "middle ground" was based on these and other mutual agreements and accomodations that were developed between the French and the Algonquins.  To facilitate trade, the French singled out individuals from various factions of Algonquins to mold into trade emissaries, whom they referred to as "Cheifs."  The French instituted a system in which they bestowed gifts to these Algonquin Cheifs, who in turn would distribute the gifts amongst their own village population.  In time, these Algonquin Cheifs developed a degree of authority within their villages due to their distribution of goods, as well as their ability to communicate with the French.  The European goods that the Cheifs distributed to members of their village soon became objects of  status in the Algonquin world.  As the Algonquins developed a want of these European goods, they began to spend some of their excess time hunting fur animals for the French which they could then trade in exhange for items such as rum, guns, knives, cloth, and various metalic utensils.  Soon this system became cemented, enabling trade to take place in a somewhat peaceful manner.      Once the French had created Cheifs within the villages who could weild some degree of authority amongst their own people, they began to use their economic control of these Cheifs to press them to pacify the warriors of their respective villages.  In this way, the French were able to help bring about the cessation of hostilities amongst many of the villages of the pays d'en haut.  Soon, according to White, the various Algonquin peoples came to view their relation to the French as one of  a child to its father.  The French became the only people who could bring about an end to the bloody fighting amongst the various tribes that was occuring in the area.  With this positon of negotiated power, the French were able to pacify the pays d'en haut long enough to build a profitable fur trade.    By 1701, the French had managed to help negotiate a peace between the Algonquins and the Iroquoi federation and thus had succeded in creating an atmosphere that would be favorable to their own economic exploitition of the region.  A period of relatively peaceful French / Algonquin interaction existed on the "middle ground" for the next few decades as the French and Algonquins engaged in trading relations.  However by the 1720s, the English had begun to inch in on French economic turf and by 1728 warfare had broken out between the English and the French/Algonquin alliance.  Although White continues with his "middle ground" hypothesis throughout the remainder of his book, the war of 1728 was, in reality, the beginning of the decline of the "middle ground."  Shortly after the  French/Algonquin alliance succeded in driving back the British, the Algonquins broke apart into pro and anti French groupings. By the 1740s, many of the Algonquins had turned against their French-made village cheifs, who preached peace and conciliation, and joined a republic comprised of various Indian nations whose purpose was to disengage from the "middle ground" and regain their traditional pre-European lifestyles. As it became increasingly apparent to the Indian villagers that the the French and English were engaged in their own imperial struggle and were only really interested in using the villages as pawns towards their own ends, the middle ground laid down on its death bed.    From this point on, many tribes, including the Iroquoi, developed an understanding of the true imperial nature of both the French and the English and refused to fight on either side.  Those tribes/villages who did decide to continue to fight on the side of the French in the Seven Years War (1754-1761) were doing so only as a part of their own strategy to rid the pays d'en haut of all European invaders - once the English had been driven out, the tribes had planned to turn on the French and drive them out as well.  Although there were still short lived re-births of  "middle ground" relations between the Algonquins and the French, these were not the norm.  Concerning the English, there was almost never any middle ground of cultural accomodation between themselves and the Algonquins.  After the defeat of French in the Seven Years War, the British occupied French positions in the pays d'en haut (in violation of a promise not to)  and as White himself states, "[the British] vision of the pays d'en haut was a simple one:  the British were conquerors; the Indians were subjects.  It was a view that abolished the middle ground."    The problem for the British was the fact that the Algonquins had never actually been conquered - they still retained village cohesion and the ability to resist British incursions with force.  As the Algonquins began to resist the British with force, the British cynically tried to bring back a policy of cultural accomodation with the Algonquins in order to normalize trade relations.  This transparent attempt to become "fathers" to the Algonquins was quickly scrapped in the face of Algonquin resistance to what they came to realize were British attempts to occupy their lands.  By the 1760s, open warfare had once again broken out amongst the Algonquins and against the British.  This pattern of short lived peace followed by rebellion and war became the norm in the pays d'en haut for the remainder of White's study, as the various factions of Europeans encroached upon Algonquin lands. By the early 19th century, at the conclusion of the book, the French traders and English traders had, for the most part, been replaced by American frontier squatters who, along with the implicit and explicit support of Washington, embarked on a campaign of removal and extermination.    Thus, a major flaw with White's analysis is the fact that the "middle ground" of cultural accomodation, which White describes throughout the book as being of central importance to the relations between the tribes of the pays d'en haut and the European invaders, was in fact already dead before White had even progressed halfway through his study.  Although White's descriptions of the various ways that the French and English developed methods to facilitate cultural understanding with the Algonquins were interesting and insightfull, it really should not have been the central theme around which the book was written.  The over-the-top focus on the "middle ground" argument found throughout White's book also leads one to question what political effect White had intended his study to have on the previous and current historiography on the subject.    White's book has been described by many historians and reviewers as a refreshing and intelligent attempt to tell the story of  Native Americans in a way that it has never been told before.  Colin G. Calloway, upon reviewing, The Middle Ground,  stated that he believed it to be a success because it altered from the established norm:  "most studies of Indian-White relations [are] too simplistic in their story of conquest and assimilation or of cultural persistence in the face of tremendous odds."    This speaks to what seems to be an attempt by White to frame his study as the real story - a story that attempts to avoid taking sides, either by resorting to romanticization of the Algonquins or slander of the Europeans.  However, the overall attempt at fairness and objectivity with which White seems to cloak his study in seems transparent at many points.    A major symptom of this problem lies with White's research materials and his interpretation of them.  White's study relies very heavily on documentation produced by the colonizers themselves.  This reliance may be a result of objective circumstance, as the Algonquins did not leave written documentation of their own activities, however when one is forced to rely on one-sided documentation to make a historical argument, it should be common sense to understand that documents cannot always be accepted as factual interpretations of past events. White runs into deep trouble when he incorporates, sometimes word for word, the writings of those Europeans whose economic and religious intrests rested with the demonization and slander of native populations.    In the case of European/Native American interactions, historians such as David Stannard in his book American Holocaust, have shown that many of the European accounts of interaction with Native Americans were deliberate exaggerations, if not outright fabrications.  Stannard has shown that it was common for European Army officers or Priests to exaggerate accounts concerning  violence, spirituality, and sexuality in order to justify to themselves and their superiors that their conquests and conversions were of necessity.  Continually throughout his book, White relays descriptions from military officers and priests that portrayed the Algonquins as savage, brutal, cannibalistic, drunken savages.  Attacks committed by Algonquins against Europeans are continually described in bloody detail while European attacks against Alqonquins are most often only stated as dry numerical fact.    There are other problamatic factors with White's choice of event descriptions in his study.  Granted, no historian can include everything in one historical study, White makes a few profound ommissions of historical occurances that would have had great impact on the overall cause and effect cycle of his study.  As was stated earlier, White begins his study in the midst of a brutal war beging waged against the Algonquin refugees by the Iroquoi federation.  White takes great time reprinting the descriptions of this warfare written by French colonists such as Allouez and Priests such as Nicolas Perrott. Page after page, White allows descriptions of extreme, bloody and canibalistic brutality being waged by the Iroquoi Federation against the Algonquins to enter his narritive without so much as a single remark about the possibility of exaggeration on the part of the colonizers.  The worst offense of these opening pages is the fact that White fails to even mention at all the fact that the Iroquoi were only in the pays d'en haut because they had been pushed west into Algonquin lands by the British.    White's opening pages paint a picture of the Iroquoi as brutal imperialistic invaders out to steal land and kill off animals for profit - White calls the Iroquoi Federation "an engine of destruction."   All of this in the first few pages really begs the obvious question: what then were the Europeans?  White shows his carelessness, or possibly his sympathy for European conquest, when he continually describes effects without refrence to their origin.  Why were the Iroquoi fighting with the Algonquins?  Why had Indian on Indian violence become endemic within the pays d'en haut region?  Why were Native American village structures falling apart? Why was there rampant alcohol abuse? Why did some of the Native Americans succumb to killing animals for profit?  White is only providing the symptoms while ignoring the root of the problem.      The debate over victimization and agency is one that is needed and correct for historians to involve themselves in and this debate is especially important when writing histories that deal with the European invasion of the Americas.  However, White's The Middle Ground has vastly over-emphasized the agency at the expense of the tragic victimization of the Native American peoples of the pays d'en haut.  White and his supporters are correct in appluading the fact that White's work has moved away from a Turnerian paradigm in which the Native Americans were marginal and inconsequential barriers to progress which were quickly overrun by Manifest Destiny.  To its credit, White's book is an execellent resource for researchers, and his extensive documentation of dates, places and names makes his book important as an encyclopedic refrence.  However, the analysis and arguments contained within The Middle Ground cannot lead to a realistic interpretation of how the events of the pays d'en haut actually played out.     Native American historians such as David Stannard, Ward Churchill, and others of the victimization with agency school, come much closer to a realistic portrayal of what the cirumstances were when it came to the interactions between the European invaders and Native American Tribes.  Their success stems from the fact that they make a concerted effort to get at the Native American perspective on the colonization of the Americas wheras White makes absolutley none.    Although in many ways White's book moves away from the classic Turnerian framework, it remains fully within it in at the same time.  White fails to move away from basing his analysis on primary sources written by the colonists themselves and in doing so he has produced yet another one-sided account, in line with the Turnerian framework.  White's book may not be Eurocentric, as it does involve the Algonquins as central players in the narrative, but it still remains entrenched in European bias and, because of this, it fails in its attempts to make a legitimate argument or to provide a realistic view of the actual events that occurred in the pays d'en haut from 1650-1812.

 I am a junior student at Computer Engineering major. I am taking a computer graphics course and unfortunately, the instructor chose this title as the textbook.   I am not saying it is a bad book or something, but it is targeted to people who have some experience with computer graphics.... (e.g: for people doing graduate studies in computer graphics) As for me, my first encounter with computer graphics in this book made me hate the topic so much. The book makes you feel that graphics involve so much mathematics, especially analytic geometry. It is so hard as an introduction to the topic of Computer Graphics.  I would not recommend this book at all as an introduction to computer graphics, it may be good for those who have some (actually a lot) of experience in this so advanced topic 
 This is a book club choice so I wished to be conversant for the discussion.  However, I could not force myself past 100 pages.  I found the style to be disjointed and just plain boring.  I am not a fan of British lit in general, the plodding, prim, takes forever to say anything, much less happen style. But this novel was just painful for a reader  to try and care about any of the characters.  My time is too valuable with other great reads to pursue rather  than this book 
 This is a self-serving justification for exploitation during the worst period of capitalism in history. It's the functional equivalent of Shell Oil claiming to be environmentally conscious.  Aldrich forgets that from those to whom much is given, much is expected 
 I bought this map, having read the previous reviews. And am returning it because it gives a much too limited view of Paris. It literally cuts out whole neighborhoods -- the north end of the 18th, most of the 19th and 20th, the 12th arrondissements(including Belleville, Menilmontant), most of the 13th, 14th, 15th arrondissements including Montparnasse, the Cite Universitaire, etc.   Fine if you want to get only to the hottest tourist spots, but totally inadequate if you want to visit the "tout Paris".   
 50 cent is one of the worst rappers to hit a recording studio almost as bad as Webbie. I see some people wrote "I bet people did not even listen to the album they just heard the singles and thought it was soft". Well i listened to the whole album and my IQ dropped 83 points it was that retarded of an album. The only reason this sells is because white people think their cool when blasting this in their vehicles. I will never purchase a G Unit affiliated album ever again even if I like the artist because I know 50 will be on it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 I was really looking forward to reading "Ever After" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  Larry Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1) Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about "Carrie," perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop: "Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude." Does that really tell us very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show? You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I wonder, makes King's novel "notorious" or the movie "even more notorious"? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time. 
 I feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here.  I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back.  I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out.  It's not easy to pick up the flow.  He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name.  I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once.  I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead 
 Yet another fantasy novel where everything is resolved by magic.  Magic is so prevelant that one scene requires a location in a "no-magic" zone - but of course magic is needed there to resolve the conflict of that scene, so the no-magic zone includes a magic zone!  In book two, of course, Anok meets a priest who may as well have stepped out of an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. It is Kaman Awi Urshé, the high priest of Set who somehow lacks arrogance, but comes across as an old, bumbling, cordial, tinkering busybody intent on learning modern science - like the old guy in The Scorpion King or the old teacher in Young Sherlock Holmes, the guys who can create anachronistic gun powder or airplanes. I have seen this type of character in so many movies/TV shows that he bored me from the get-go.  His descriptions are wonderful, though.  It is easy to read and easy to visualize.  However, I was hoping for a stronger plot and stronger characters (Anok is supposed to be falling into darkness, but he isn't; and the supporting characters do nothing and add nothing to the storyline) 
 first like alot of folks I know I was Stunned by the sudden passing of John Ritter.I have always Been a Big Fan of His.this film was pretty basic but thanks to John Ritter it had some real funny moments.it was corny in spots but John Ritter saved it as He usually did whenever he was Performing.He had that Gift.the film is pretty average but John Ritter made it worth seeing 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 If you're looking for the text of the Gospel of Judas, you want the one edited by Rudolphe Kasser, Marvin Meyer, and Gregor Wurst and published by National Geographic, under ISBN 1426200420.  Robinson's book is a narrative that was written without seeing the manuscript of the Gospel.  Apparently, he tried to jump on the Judas bandwagon with very little to go on.  So don't be deceived by the title... 
 Eve Bunting seems to hold the opinion that breaking the laws of this country can be justified.  I would not read this book to my third graders.  In the case of illegal immigration, the end does not justify the means.  In  her book, Ms. Bunting portrays a family fleeing a Cuba-like country for a  Florida-like destination. After enduring a harrowing journey in a rickity,  leaky boat, the family arrives in America and is greeted by their fellow  countrymen in time to celebrate Thanksgiving.  Sorry, but this book does  not warm my heart.  The problems and responsibilities  thrust upon the  United States by uncontrolled immigration is too serious an issue to gloss  over 
 Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there 
 Why did my eyes fill with tears the first time I read this book? Every one of us has parts of ourselves we are cut off from, parts we sometime even try to be rid of. This wonderful story, so charmingly illustrated, simply reminds us to embrace ourselves, even those troublesome parts that can sometimes redeem us 
 This book was boring to me.  The author went on and on with detailed descriptions of the principles of diving, repeating himself many times.  It was very hard to read the story through all this extra detail.  It seemed as if the author needed to add the detail to make the story longer but it actually greatly took away from the story.  I do not recommend 
 Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase.  
 Granola was very dry and not too sweet.  Need milk.  I prefer Costco's granola -- it taste much better.  I would not recommend the purchase of this product.  Now I got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages.  Also bought the fruit and nut one.  Hope that's better.  
 Buyer beware.  Great chair for one year then the motor died.  The warranty is one year so I am out of luck.  If you think $600 is a good deal for one year's use of the chair then this is the chair for you 
 I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days.   I'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money, time and effort. 
 I bought this book because I read other customers' good review comments.  I have to say "Don't buy it"!  The book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test.  With your common sense, you will be able to tell your child all about it.  Plus, the price is really a rob.  ...  I was fooled.  I hope you won't 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 Author Kevin Murphy, of course, was a writer/performer on the cult TV hit, "Mystery Science Theater 3000." As such, you'd think he'd have the sort of insight and humor that would make this book a great read for movie fans.  Unfortunately, though, Murphy spends most of his Year whining about contemporary moviegoing. Okay, so we know that multiplexes suck. We know that theater food is both bad and overpriced. We know that most modern movies suck, too. Murphy is right to point these things out, but he dwells on them page after page with little of the wit one might expect. And in his eagerness to knock even the better aspects of American cinema (dissing both "Pulp Fiction" and Jerry Lewis, for instance) while singing the praises of the most obscure of foreign documentaries, Murphy comes off as more movie snob than movie fan. To top it all off, there's an air of political correctness in much of Murphy's writing that turns up the smug factor. This was a great idea for a book, but it's neither as funny as you want it to be nor as definitive a comment on the current state of cinema as Murphy may have wanted it to be. A disappointment. 
 I purchased the Garmin Forerunner 201 but when I received the watch it would charge so I have not been able to use it and now it is back with the manufacturer.  Garmin warranty is for 1 year so everthing should work out but I have not received it back yet so I do not have too much to say.  
 I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it. 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 It is tough to rebut a work like this. It is a rambling, incoherent series of stream of consciousness, conclusory mish mash. The authors believe that we are supposed to believe their arguments by authority.   The arguments involve children's fairy tales about spacemen. There is medical quackery that the cause of black hypertension is the White race. The entire work is a mess and a hate speech tirade, of crucial omissions, and of racist lies. Rebutting Mein Kampf, barking back at dogs seem more productive use of one's time.   What is useful, is that this book lays out the theoretical jusitification for PC speech codes and other constitutional torts. If any plaintiff is injured by such, this book is worth perusing for specific guideline makers, and potential co-defendants. As guideline makers, and the inspiration for these violations, the relevant author should be held accountable, to deter. You may think that the authors are unlikely to have assets. However, whom do they work for, and under whose auspices and for whose benefit were these articles written? Most of the authors are law school or college professors, hired by schools with big endowments.   It is not clear that the guideline makers are shielded by the First Amendment.   Otherwise, every article should be challenged by any intellectually honest student forced to study this book.  
 I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but this is an awful book, which might not be the writer's fault, since it's based on a terrible song.  The activities along the way are fun enough. But if a child's book is supposed to be fun, it's also supposed to teach little life lessons.  What does this one teach?  My 3 year old is terrified of the book.  He says the bear is mean.  I say, "Why?"  "Because he looks big and scary."  So my kid has learned that big, scary-looking, unknown things are mean (if you haven't read the book, the bear does nothing "mean"--he's just hanging out in his cave).  More--if they're provoked and they chase you, it's because they're mean (not because a bunch of kids provoked them).  At the same time, my kid loves Shrek, and I love the fact that it teaches him to look beyond surface appearance, to face a big, scary thing and learn about it--not to call it mean when you don't know it, not to bother it and run.  The book's just screwy.      
 I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables.  They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged.  The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table.  These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster.  
 I could not stand this book. It used verbs like it was going out of style. It tries to make you believe that you're about to embark upon an amazing adventure of learning where discoveries will lead to ultimate fulfillment and success :) . It's 75% fluff to make you believe that all life problems will be solved if only you could learn how to learn. It was like Anthony Robbins wrote it. Motivational B.S.. Some of it was good, if you siffed long enough you could get a couple gold flakes out of this one, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a deserving 1. But it was so anoying in how it was written. It was so bad I had a hard time paying attention. Awful motivational and persuasive [stuff]. Do waste you money buying this. .. 
 "...the authors rightly see the need to get over the rigid literalism of classical-revised dispensationalism and to work with extra-Biblical materials for proper hermeneutics and exegesis."  The above is quoted from one of the reviews posted.  This implies that we must go beyond God's Word to find the truth...does that really make sense?  God's Revelation to man is complete...as it says in the end of the book of that title.  Progressive Dispensationalism, and Covenant Theology, do not adhere to a grammatical, historical, contextual, and literal hermeneutic.  If you do not do this...then you can make Scripture mean anything you wish.  The best books on PD and Covenant Theology would be the ones that illustrate this 
 I haven't enjoyed the boom box because the antenna couldn't find a signal, after moving it to every possible south facing setting, to send to the boom box. I used this xm receiver in one of my trucks and it worked fine. not the case with the indoor set-up. 
 When the time came to read this year's Halloween book, I chose Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night by Nicholas Rogers. I was looking for an interesting, scholarly treatment of the holiday. I didn't find it.  That's not to say that I didn't learn anything. According to Rogers, Halloween, as it is celebrated in the United States and Canada, was basically brought to the New World by Scottish and Irish immigrants. In those countries, Halloween apparently grew out of Pagan autumn festivals and the Christian holidays of All Saints and All Souls days. The Day of the Dead had a similar origin in Mexico. What began in the US and Canada as a celebration of Celtic pride evolved into a night of teen and adult rowdiness, which was in turn tamed into "trick-or-treating." In the last few decades, the commercial engines have behaved like a positive-feedback loop: Because Halloween is popular, there is money to be made, so it needs to be hyped and marketed to make it more popular, so more money can be made, and so on.  See? That didn't take 170 pages. The remaining space is occupied by the author supporting his conclusions with data and argumentation. The data generally amounts to lists of single sentence anecdotes gleaned from various Canadian and American newspaper editions published in late October and early November over a wide range of years. There are also a number of illustrations, including festive holiday snapshots taken by the author. The author's argumentation is based on induction from these published data points -- as well as stories from his colleagues and dentist -- to explain their significance as only an academic could. For example, this gem is put forth as part of the discussion of the relevance of the Halloween movies by John Carpenter to the actual holiday (p. 121):  "For it could be argued that Myer's murderous interventions are facilitated by the collapse of Halloween as an inclusive family holiday and its transformation into a set of generational consumer rites in which family mutualities are neglected."  What?! The plots of the six Halloween "films" are discussed and their commentary on the holiday is "explored." It is hard to take this kind of scholarship seriously when it takes slasher-flix so seriously 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 A few months after reading and thoroughly enjoying Hey Nostradamus, I picked this book up, thinking that it would be good. Okay, I can  see why the book might appeal to some.. it raises a lot of questions that young adolescents often ask themselves about life while struggluing to find a true identity, making the reader feel like they relate to what the narrators(as there are six in the book) have to say. But come on, what is this book even about? It seems to be full of pointless ramblings of worried and depressed characters (all seemingly sharing the same personality) that don't even establish anything. Nothing is accomplished as these narrators babble, and it seems that each character is right back where they started at the end of each story, or else the story seems incomplete somehow. Some things that are said in the book do make the reader think or laugh because they know that they've asked those same questions to themselves, but in the end... this book has no plot and is quite a waste of time 
 Rarely have I seen such speculative extra-Biblical theologizing in a purportedly Christian book.  Several things are commendable, such as references to the death of Christ for sinners, evangelical truths like God's sovereignty and man's accountable agency, the Trinity, Jesus' Deity, reality of the afterlife and God as Creator. There is a definite evangelistic appeal to readers to consider the claims of Christ and the abundant evidence in Scripture (Primary Order) and nature (Secondary Order) of God's powerful existence. Also evident is the author's sincerity in embracing scientific interpretation of physics data.   He is Persuaded, but alas not Persuasive in this arena.  String-theory seems to be the flesh and blood of this book's plot. Unfortunately, it is a highly hypothetical, still-in-protoresearch-phase area of physics bordering on metaphysics. It has but scanty observational, scientific-method data and a few creative equations to bolster the rare physicists who consider it even to lie within the bounds of 'True Science'. Unfortunately, the author seems to consider it well within the realm of plausibility, possibility, probability, preponderance. His pronouncements throughout the book give the impression of fait accompli. For him, String-theory is the sine qua non that is the long lost rapprochement and Unification Factor bridging the gap between physics-metaphysics and theology.  And here lies the main troubling aspect of the author's faith opinions: trying to enlist a speculative-at-best physics novelty to unravel knotty theological problems in Christian Doctrines without resorting to the Bible itself first and foremost. His extra-Biblical approach gets him deeper and deeper into hypothetical extra-dimensional realms of imagination.  For those interested in a more thorough rebuttal of the Beyond-the-Cosmos notions postulated here, check the web for the article by William Lane Craig reviewing this book pointing out the manifest errors and mal-interpretations of Scripture.  
 Although I believe this book helps enlighten one to the reality that our soul and deepest longings as women are interconnected with the Creator and His passionate love for us...MUCH of it's "theology" is flawed.  I felt an appeal to self exaltation and a humanizing of God that is clearly anti-biblical.  I would guide any of my fellow Christian readers to remember that all false doctrine is effective because it is dressed up in truth....but it's heart message is false and usually self exhorting.  
 The very cover of the book yells out "ignoramus"!  As anyone who has learned classical Jewish texts (ie Talmud, Midrash etc. or any text for that matter) will tell you - context is everything. From the very cover and throughout the book the author misquotes, misinterprets and distorts classic texts as he tries to pull together the weakest of threads in order to make a case to malign Judaism and its adherents 
 Contrary to what some other reviewers have stated, I do not believe Service goes out of his way to humanize Stalin.  However, Service glosses over huge and momentous events, such as the Great Terror.  We have all heard of the monstrous acts committed by Stalin but none of the details are given, other than numbers and names.  It seems inconceiveable that a 600 plus page book would be superficial and lacking specificity but it does.  One gets the feeling Service felt previous biographers had already provided the dirty details and therefore left them out.  He also does not tell Stalin's story in any chronological manner.  He jumps around endlessly.  I cannot recommend this book 
 Have you ever tried to tell a story to a friend or acquaintance, some personal epic filled with twists and turns, comedy and drama, thrills and chills and all sorts of gut clenching climaxes only to be met with a blank expression and a vaguely rhetorical "I guess you just had to have been there?"  That was my reaction to this book.  It's an interesting insight to gambling culture and one woman's take on it, but after a while the two threads of the book (chapters alternate between her autobiography and her experiences at the World Series of Poker) begin to feel schizophrenic.  Her history begins to read more and more like a recitation of rote facts while her descriptions of the hands she played in Vegas become more bombastic, which makes for an awkward reading experience.  One chapter is a description of how she met this guy and they hung out and he moved back west and then she married him and followed him and so on while the next is a breathless explanation of how exciting it was when the three of clubs came up!  Given that this book is essentially focussed on her experiences in poker, this dichotomy is perfectly understandable, but towards the end of the book I was worn out by the constant yo-yoing of the narrative that I was simply relieved to be done with it 
 This book is not clearly written.  Many terms are used incorrectly or in a very questionable manner.  The answers in the back of the book for all odd-numbered "homework" problems and all test questions is very helpful and convenient.  If I were chosing a textbook, it would not be this 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 The "bad serial number" routine as the first reviewer. I'll try Adobe Customer Service when I stop fuming 
 I did like the Three Cheers album, in fact I liked every single song on the cd.  The Black Parade is basically the same thing.  In every song I find myself being reminded of a song on the previous cd.  This cd is extremely similar but has less diversity.  If you already own Three Cheers, I wouldn't waste the money on Black Parade 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I have to agree with the previous reviews that this dispensses honey way too slowly.  Additionally, it is much too difficult to fill without making a mess, since you cannot have the top open without having the bottom open as well.  This dispenser is just not worth the trouble and mess, no matter how great the idea 
 Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original 
 In the future, antibiotics have become mostly useless and large portions of the population are dead from outbreaks of disease. Janie Crow, a surgeon who is retraining to be a forensic pathologist, is on a research trip in England. One of her soil samples turns up a deadly surprise that sends events spiraling out of control. Janie quickly finds herself running from the all-powerful Bio-cops with the help her old friend Bruce.  In the past, physician Alejandro Canches is dealing with the dangers of the Black Plague in the 14th century as well as the peril of being a hidden Jew moving in a Christian world. Both Alejandro and Janie find romance in the midst of disaster, but will they each find a cure for the plague?  This book has a lot of interesting concepts, and I wanted to like it. However, in the end, I just wanted to be done with it. Most of the characters are one-dimensional, and they all make frustratingly irrational choices. The introduction of a mystical element halfway through jars with the science-feel of the rest of the book. The ending is tacked on out of nowhere - I actually had to check to make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped any pages.  The chapters alternate between the two stories, and this works fairly well, but there is a tenuous connection between the two at best. Both plots rely heavily on the reader's suspension of disbelief - in the end the coincidences that drive the plot twists are painfully obvious and approach the absurd. Alejandro's story is more logically consistent than Janie's story, and Alejandro is an interesting and sympathetic character. Regrettably, I had a very hard time sympathizing with any character in Janie's tale. 
 Everyone knows Eminem. We know what he's like, we all know about his marital problems with Kim and his other problems with his mother and we know of his evident love for his daughter Hailey. Personally, I've heard enough about all of them, but Marshall Mathers thought there was more to say. This album was a serious mistake on his part simply because the SATIRE of his previous work has simply been boiled down to PARODY. Take Just Lose It for example. Eminem has a string of successes for his albums' first singles. Take the now legendary My Name Is. It was insightful to pop culture hypocrisy and still gave insight to his life. I loved his first album. Every song on it was brilliant. Now I feel robbed. Just Lose It is a shameful stab at Michael Jackson and homosexuality. He has aslo adopted a new way of rapping and "singing". It is nasal and it pisses me off. His song Puke is an immature low blow to Kim. If you hate her so much why don't you pretend she doesn't exist? Mockingbird does not have the same quality and sensitivity of Hailey's Song. Rainman is the only song I listen to on this album. It in itself deserves about three stars out of five. Some of the beats are catchy, some of his words are still funny. But if you have to get his albums, buy The Slim Shady LP or The Marshall Mathers LP 
 This book is as worthless for research as "The Da Vinci Code." I was particularly shocked at the authors' decision to ignore the fact that Tycho was an unbearable snob, a petty despot and a complete boor in order to portray Kepler in the worst possible light. If Tycho was indeed poisoned, it may have been by one of the hoodlums in his family or one of the many powerful nobles he snubbed. Although it is common to sacrifice the innocent in the interest of sensationalism, this pseudo-historical account, with its extensive bibliography, truly sinks to new lows in selective revelation. The cynical allusion to Kepler's religious ambivalence is the product of the post-modern approach to religion, where, for instance, Catholics get divorced and hope for the best. It is clear from his writings that Kepler took his religious commitments seriously and was genuinely hurt by what he called the un-Christian attitudes between the brothers in Christ.  The decision to overlook this along with other well documented information that calls Tycho's character into question (for instance the horrors of his treatment of the Hveen population or his routine snubbing of Christian IV) and reveals Kepler as a man of conscience falls somewhere between irresponsible and slanderous. 
 This book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won't heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy. 
 I just watched Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner on the Dennis Miller Show, and she trotted out the trusty "women only make 76 cents for the same work a man gets paid a dollar." This is another of the patently false statements used to divide men and women. It has clearly been debunked by multiple studies which block for age, marital and parental status, and years on the job. But even if the proof weren't there, I challenge you to put this to a simple logic test. Most businesses operate on a very thin margin. CEOs are given huge bonuses if they can improve the bottom line by 1-2%. What do you think they would get if they could save 24% on labor costs just by trading their male employees for female employees? If this canard were true, males would NEVER find work in this country 
 There is no question that this book is the product of an unbounded thinker of possibilities. Lee Smolin's opening description of the history and current state of theoretical physics is highly understandable and makes a  more compelling (albeit unconscious) argument for Intelligent Design theory  rather than his one of "Cosmic Natural Selection." What is interesting is  professor Smolin's rejection a priori of any answer lying outside the realm  of human observation.  He then summarily proposes to describe our universe  as "naturally selected" to maximize the quantity of black holes; they of  course being the "wombs" of new universes with their own black holes, etc.   I have to ask, "Why must they create universes; why not leprechauns or  fairies, for both of which we have minimally far more observational  testimony"?  To quote Davies & Brown from their "Ghost in the  Atom", the many-worlds interpretation "introduces a preposterous amount of  `excess metaphysical baggage' into our description of the physical world."   Rudolph Peierls, formerly at Oxford, dismisses such a theory with a simple  question: "Since we have no means of seeing or ever communication with the  other universes, why invent them?" It is easily more probable to believe  that 10 space/time dimensions really do coexist than to buy into a theory  composed of: an infinite number of ever expanding (non-colliding?)  universes, created by some unknown mechanism, in some unknown space, for  some unknown reason. Who says faith is outside the realm of science? If a  new theory is truly needed now, this seems an unlikely candidate 
 Okay, someone writes a book to attempt to prove MacDonald innocent.  The writer makes lots of money just as McGinnis did with the first book Fatal Vision(which by the way is more entertaining to read.)  But the facts of the matter are that MacDonald's appeals have all been turned down and every bit of new evidence has been rejected by the courts.  And now his attorneys are trying to get a new trial based on what they say was a threat to MacDonald from a prosecutor.  Sounds like grabbing at straws to me.  The courts decide and they have found him guilty.  Of course there are people who will cling to their belief that he is innocent.  But then there are people who  believe that Scott Peterson is innocent too.  But they're not the courts so it doesn't matter. Skip this book, it's boring and nothing new is spectacularly revealed.  
 I recently purchased this book to strengthen my momentum skills. Being somewhat new to TA, it is has came easy having a extensive computer background. I found Prings explanation on oscillators complete but lacks  application to daytrading/investing. I met him at a recent show asking him  pertinent questions as they apply to the market and trading and he  replied...."I need to buy another book". This book is good on how  oscillators are made....NOT HOW THEY ARE USED 
 I purchased the book believing by the title and the description that I was purchasing a cookbook featuring generally healthier recipes. When I received the book I was surprised to learn that they are all low carb recipes only. 
 The Good Neighbor explores the relationship between new neighbors: a gay couple (hypermasculine Will and sensitive Rory) and a married coulple (Meg, a tough, career obsessed lawyer and Austin who takes care of their two sons between jobs). Rory and Austin are at home most days in their beautiful gated community in Southern Florida. Nature takes it's course & repressed Austin falls for Rory.  As with Quinn's last novel,"Back Where It Started," the main characters are totally defined by their sexual positions in the bedroom. Will's nickname is bruit; Rory is sexy and refined; Meg is too bust working to entertain thoughts about sex; Austin falls for Rory, plays the sexual dominate role & gets his old job back.  The most depressing news came at the end: Jay Quinn is "at work on his next novel." I gave this novel two stars (rather than one) only because I was able to read it all the way through. You can guess the end within 75 pages or less 
 If it were possible to give this movie zero stars, i would have. Although it may have won an Academy Award and been considered great in it's day, it is now outdated and boring. Unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you, then maybe you will find it interesting. When i say anyone, i do mean anyone. The main chracter, Sonny, who is a teenager sleeps with Ruth, wife of his footbal coach and the young girl, Jacy, sleeps with her mother's lover on a pool table. The film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted. You would think a movie called "The Last Picture Show" would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie. There is some nudity which was huge for the time of it's release since it was practically unheard of. The film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period, 1950's. This movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country, making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing. If this movie would have been made in present day, it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an "award winning movie" and not a porn. Also if you think the movie was bad, try reading the book it was based off of, much worse 
 What's remarkable is how much gall and bravado it takes to defend a failed economic perspective AFTER it's been tested and proven wrong. Bartley, of course, was one of the chief proponents of "supply-side" economics, an extreme right-wing attitude toward economic policy that had little to do with solid economics, or indeed economic theory at all, so much as an attitude toward government and capitalism.  Even Milton Freidman, who had many valid initial points about the constraints on growth resulting from excessive taxes and over-regulation, or the delayed effects of federal monetary policy, never went this far... and non-economists like Bartley and Laffer were pretty much alone in their claims about the "magic of the marketplace" generating increased revenues by lowering taxes.  The sad thing is that, even though serious economists never bought into or supported the "supply side" concept, it didn't really matter to cranks like Bartley: their purpose was superficial populism and public-opinion essays to drum up right-wing support. And, of course, that resulted in the great Reagan-era "experiment"--which was (let's not forget) an unqualified failure by any measure.  Bartley would like to pretend otherwise--understandably, since he was largely responsible for this era of economic catastrophe. But to claim with a straight face that the supply-side policies of the 80s resulted in faster growth is simply ludicrous. Supply-side tax cuts generated a hideous and unprecedented peacetime deficit, a loss of federal revenues, a widened gap between rich and poor, and _slower_ growth. These are indisputable facts. If anyone had suggested this experiment with a full awarenss of the inevitable consequences for our society, they would be condemned as inhumane sociopaths.  But like any crackpot, Bartley isn't impressed with mere facts. You can always tell a far-right crackpot by their willingness to ignore not only the knowledge of those who've actually made their careers studying the field (i.e., "that darn ol' academia"), but also the real-world results of their tested and failed policies.  Supply-side was a disastrously bad idea with no intellectual foundation (not even among monetarists of the Friedman/Chicago school). It proved to be a complete failure. That alone should be enough to ensure that no one ever listens to Bartley again, let alone takes seriously the idea that these policies should be tried again.  But like the Evil Dead, the old supply-side notions of "tax cuts for growth" have never died in the minds of the frenetic faithful at the Wall Street Journal. So we're still dealing with this idiocy today, long after a trial run should have discredited this foolishness once and for all 
 Booo -- its a stinker. Leland is a good writer, he does a good job historically contextualizing Hip, and some of it is enjoyable to read. But I still say "Boooo."  I really don't like the way Leland makes marketability a necessary trait to hipness. He concludes that Hip and Capitalism are locked in a symbiotic relationship. He makes it sound like in the New Economy (though he doesn't use that term) working at a huge multinational corporation is hip.  Nothing could be less hip. He turns a blind eye to the economic ravages of capitalism and the exploitation it causes around the world. What is hip about a bunch of Americans living it up at the expense of the rest of the world that makes our "hip" designer brands and high tech toys?   The only thing hip about Leland's idea of "Hip Capitalism", as he likes to term it, is if you don't have a conciense and are on the top of the heap. For the rest of us, "Hip Capitalism" is a pain in the a$$.   So I think the book is well writen and he makes a powerful argument, I just don't agree with him. So I give the book a big "BOOOOOO. 
 For anyone who has any basic familiarity with using a computer (viz. using EXPLORE to navigate the file system and some program to defragment the drive and determining how much disk space you have available) this book is useless.  It really doesn't present anything other than designing a disc label that you won't get with the instruction manuals with the hardware/software you buy for burning a CD or DVD.  It's "worth less than nothing" because it costs time and postage to return the book.  But, I'd say it's better than "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Creating CDs and DVDs" 
 I have an older wafflemaker that has the removable plates.  When I got ready to purchase another one for a second home, I found that choices were limited.  I found this wafflemaker and I thought the small size would be convenient for storage.  I tried it today and after 20 minutes and a house full of company, I still didn't have one waffle ready to go.  There is just not enough heat to brown the waffle, no less cook it.  I would take it back if the paperwork had not gotten misplaced.  This morning, I was ready to just throw it out the window 
 If you are buying this book and are over 35, you probably already know you are too old to have good eggs, waited too long to have kids, or marry the right guy, and were selfish by focusing on you and your career during your 20s.  These two seemed to want to just chastise you for not grabbing the first guy you found at 18 and starting to have kids.  I also found them a little pompous (as in yea - I had fertility problems but now look at me I have two kids, ha ha).  Any woman who is going through infertility does not need this sort of info.  I found it almost cruel. However, I could have ignored the stupid criticisms if there was any really useful info in the book.  There wasn't.  Most of it was very basic.  If you are actually dishing out $25 for an infertility book you have probably already discovered cycle days and cervical mucus and the fact you need a fertility specialist.  Try another book.  This one is a waste of money 
 Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it.  He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines 
 As a stand-alone story (not a "prequel"), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!   As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower "re-telling" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than "space dust" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more 
 I read this collection of life stories and events with an admitedly negative attitude toward it because of my dislike of the first book of this collection.  Nevertheless, I thought that this volume was even worse than it's predicessor.  I don't believe that this book has any literary value to it at all.  It most certainly didn't make me feel better about my life.  Personally I believe that these events are things that happen to everyone in their lifetime.  Merely reading about them AGAIN had even less appeal to me than it did the first time 
 There really is one very good thing about this novel. It is the last one. With no EEEEVVVILL France left, Sir Percy must find a new hobby. Perhaps he will take up bottle-cap collecing. Anyways, I harbor particularly averse  feelings to this particular episode of Pimpernel antics because of its  sickening portrayal of Robespierre. Orczy sure outdoes herself in terms of  historical laughability this time. Actually, I would laugh but I'm too  scared thinking off all the poor misguided people who take the Baronness'  word on this. OK, tell me...is there something wrong with this picture.  Robespierre, that EEEVVVVILLL man, dreams of beheading all of France.  Saint-Just, who anyone who knows anything about the Revolution at all knows  was more radical than R and who supported Robespierre in everything, is  described as "one of the most romantic figures of the entire  Revolution." This is enough to make one's head ache, if one were  inclined to believe that it is of the least importance at all. Fortunately  for me, I am saved from that unhappy predicament. Like all the rest of the  Pimpernel novels this is a series of unlikely adventures rescuing  aristos...to heck with the common people!....with very little grace of  writing and an absolutely deplorable grasp on reality 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 No earth shattering or interesting receipes here.  You can find most of the party ideas online 
 I adore the books written by David Grossman. This is, to my mind, by far: the worst he's ever done. It was panned in other countries for good reason: It's absolutely juvenile and puerile and all the run on sentences that worked in See:Under Love do not work here, in a story about Nothing, one lonely guy's neuroses. So, I think it's his name, a great writer's name, that is selling this book. Not the content. It's awful 
 Let me just start by saying that I thought the first book was brilliant.  I really loved it.  I just couldn't get into this book though.  The main character was too whiny and depressing right from the start.  She irritated me so much that I stopped reading 
  The book does contain usefull information, but it left me with an awkward feeling after reading. It describes the 'typically Japanese things' from a personal western point of view, without explaining why, how, what, etc. -Japan is a weird and silly country, but there are nice temples-   Or is it the writer that is the culture shock ? If you want an objective book about Japan, keep searching 
 This book was really a waste of time. When I was done reading, I was no better off than when I started. The beginning is really interesting in that it describes what kind of feelings go on inside the mind of a shy person. I thought I was the only one in the world who felt these things, and it was interesting to see them expressed by someone else in a book. So I continued to read on to the parts where they tell you how to get better. It said to try stuff like writing in a journal every day and to "think positive", "be assertive", and "practice making small talk". Like I didn't consider that on my own! This book really did not need to be written. What they could have done was just take the beginning of the book and sell it on its own as a short story or something, since it is the only useful or interesting part. After the first part of the book, it's basically telling you to go see a psychiatrist or get medication or both. It starts to get repetitive and is basically filled with the same useless suggestions that any person could have thought of, but they keep re-wording them throughout the book. So save yourself some money and don't buy this book. If you're interested in reading the opening part of the book, see if you can find it in a library 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 Muybridge's "The Human Figure in Motion" is a classic.  The frame by frame photographs of figures (male, female, athletes, children) are vintage photos from the latter half of the 19th century. They document action: carrying objects, a man jumping, child crawling, etc, as well as activities common to the time that are not evident in everyday activity now, such as discus throwing, fencing, woman pouring water from a jug, etc.  These photos, although small, are still of major importance to the artist who tries to understand muscle groups for drawing the figure.  Great resource book 
 Using this book is like driving without peripheral vision - you can't take the slightest turn off the single path chosen by the authors. Sure, this book will walk you through making a stateless session bean and deploying it on JBoss. But what if you want to make a client? What if you want to use the Eclipse IDE provided by JBoss? Suddenly, you're left on your own. This book may be helpful to someone making a first pass through J2EE, but if you want to use JBoss for any practical purpose, this book is practically worthless 
 Hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on Fox news time after time. Move over OReilly 
 This book should be called "Johnny Depp" because it is more about her relationship with him than about herself. I expected a biography on her life but it's about how this super-waif got famous and then those who made her famous turned against her. Then the rest of the book was about her unhappy relationship with Johnny Depp. I really like Kate Moss and would like to have read a book about her...not her ex-boyfriend. 
 I thought this book was one of the most depressing books I've ever read and I'm an avid reader. If this was the first Hamilton book I picked up I'd never read another. However I do know this is not the norm for her. I was left unsatistied and very sad about the fate of the characters that you had come to care about by the end (charachters were well written, just not the plot). Please don't waste your time with this one 
 What a rip-off....I agree it is the first comic..but sure is not the best value for your money.  
 My question for the Morons at Paramount is why do possibly glue the sticker seals the container with such strong stuff that you cannot avoid ruining the container when you remove it. May I remind that this a COLLETOR'S ITEM!!!!! Therefore if you damage it is WORTHLESS 
 I've read this book and it works if you use it but its nothing new.  If you want to save yourself some time from buying it drink water eat a well balanced meal, and exercise.  Everything Oprah touches turns to gold.  If only I could get 14.95 for my advice 
 This software does NOT support the Explorist series from Magellan. For that you need Magellan DirectRoute v3.0, which is part number 980654-04. Amazon doesn't currently carry that version. If you have an Explorist, do not buy this, go elsewhere and get the correct version.  If you have an older Magellan GPS, this should work just fine

 Jim has been in the business for a long time, but has the particular knack of using plain language, logical reasoning, and clear warnings to explain the methods and pitfalls of an esoteric art - boat building. He has that in common with Philip Bolger, Harold Payson, Thomas Jones, Parker Ruel, and Karl Stambaugh.(and others, including "Mister" Chapelle.) A generation bent on making things not simple, but straight forward and practical. You can really build a good serviceable boat straight from the book without either agonizing for months nor busting the bank. You will not end up with a statuesque ocean racer, but you will obtain a useable, user-friendly, nautically sound, so cheap to use that you will use it often, that you "made it me-self !" and even looks good 
 I read this book hoping that it would be "exercise enlightening."  I found, however, that it is nothing really new. It all comes down to the number of calories you put into your body and the number of calories you use per day. With a combination of strength training, cardio workouts and moderation in eating, ANYONE can lose weight. And, I am here to tell you that running does help you to lose weight.  
 I was so excited to see another Noam Chomsky film, but terribly disappointed with this particular collection of snippets.  The editing was so distracting and disconnected that I stopped watching the piece.  There are silly cut aways just for "art's sake",  the cameras go in and out of focus and shift angles for no reason, and the order of the lecture bits didn't make any sense to me.  Chomsky's ideas are hard enough to follow if you don't have background info. on his subject, but it is fun and challenging to try to follow him as he explains the agendas behind our news, our reporting, our politicians, etc....  This film makes that kind of challenge almost impossible.  (at least for me) Chomsky is, in my opinion, a genius and this film did not convey his coherent thoughts and eloquent speeches.  I recommend Manufacturing Consent if you are new to Noam 
 I think one of the other reviewers said it best: this book is for unapologetic elitists.  It completely turned me off from the first chapter.  
 I give Morgan props that she does her best to banish preconceived notions of Wicca in the minds of readers who are constantly told they'll "go to hell" for following the religion, but for beginners, I would recommend Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practicioner and Earth, Air, Fire and Water by Cunningham. I'm just starting out, but I can tell a credible resource by how much bias is in it, and Morgan seems to give mostly opinions 
 This reference work is invaluable in finding mystery series by woman up to 1999 or so, when I bought my copy.  However, it is now very much out-of-date and of little use on newer series/authors/titles.  I keep checking to see if there's a Detecting Women 4, and can still hope, but possibly this one is the end of the line.  What a shame 
 With the "New Yorker" magazine article publication, it felt like Homes finally consummated numerous compelling revelations about her adoption and subsequent events. It's nonspecificity made her thoughts cosmopolitan and alluring. Her wretchedness seemed intolerable. Her fiction works had authentication.  Her book is the antithesis of sophisticated essay. The more explicit her details, the less the essence of her chronicle rivet the reader. Malevolence supplanted empathetic humanism.   Indubitably, Homes's adoption lacerated her intellect birthing her fiction.  A thank-you note will suffice.  30 years later, trying to ferret out the cipher from strangers & promiscuous documents is absurd. Her "imagining my mother" (page. 130, etc.) is fiction, not memoir. It diminishes the book 
 Really only for someone who knows nothing about computers. Very basic information 
 Not to take anything from the authors experiences which were pretty fantastic, but they weren't anything that I could relate to, or very little.  I wish the description of the book had been a little clearer about that and I probably would not have bought the book.  If you want to read about a man whose life was an adventure, I would recommend this book. If you are looking for tips on simplifying your own life, not so much. There were some things, but not many.

 Don't buy this book, unless you are heavily interested in literary theory, linguistics and/or semiotics.  This is not a history book nor a book on history, but rather a linguistic and literary interpretation of some accounts of the conquest of America.  Further, the book is biased.  It does not discuss the truth of the matters asserted in the early conquest accounts and there is barely any criticism and analysis of the reliability of those sources.  Get instead a Prescott if you want to know what the conquest was all about 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 I never found  Persepolis to be anything more than a curiosity. For me, the unrealistic artwork prevented any emotional reaction whatsoever  to the material. This is definitely not because the book is a graphic novel.  I learned to read by devouring Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, etc.  But for me, non-fiction requires realistic artwork to be effective.  I found my reading experiences of the two volumes  to be mirror images of each other -- in volume one, my curiosity as to what happened next increased with each story, whereas in volume two each story was less interesting than the one that came before.  I found the stories after Marjane returned to Iran to be banal, even trite.  It was a struggle to finish.  The only thing I came away with from these volumes is that Marjane's family and circle of friends are very westernized.  Is that reflective of the country as a whole?  Who knows. But the narrowness of the book's focus -- and I know it was a memoir and memoirs are very personal and therefore very narrow -- made for a very claustrophic reading experience. I learned a fair amount about Marjane Satrapi, but I'm not sure I learned anything significant about Iran. 
 Picked this up based on a "Oh, you like China Mieville, you'll like this" recommendation.  Big mistake.  The prose is bland, the characters are universally one-dimensional, the plot "twists" are stunningly obvious throughout, and the whole thing feels like the quality of writing you expect to pick up at a 4th grade bookmobile stop.  I read through the first story, "Victoria" with rapidly dwindling interest.  Only because I felt it unfair to judge the book on less than half of the read did I bother reading through the second story, "Hottentots" which is no better (and in many ways worse) than the first.    Steer clear of this one.  I'm sure you could find worse things to read, but it'd take effort 
 You want the cold-blooded truth about this album? Okie dokie, how's this: it does not amount to much (if anything) more than a rehash of the hardcore scene and all those involved in its upbringing since the late Eighties? (Two of the most obvious bands Throwdown repeatedly and unabashedly cop are Biohazard and Hatebreed.) And, unfortunately, it's a lot worse than it sounds.  But even if this album didn't cop innumerable bands' sounds before Throwdown's time, "Haymaker" (the band's third full-length) would still sound as boring as it did when it was first released back in 2003. See, the hardcore/metalcore popularity explosion in recent years has both helped and hurt Throwdown. On the one hand, they formed in 1999, so they beat fair number of bands to the music scene, which just happened to become very popular only a few years later. Thus, nowadays, groups like First Blood and I Killed The Prom Queen look like a Johnny-come-lately so Throwdown don't have to. But then again, it's partially because groups like First Blood have since debuted (with material very similar) that "Haymaker" sounds so faceless.  It's indisputable that Throwdown don't even hold a candle to the groundbreaking hardcore groups of the past two decades, but it was very alarming to learn how well this album was received when it was released. I read one review that said it was among the best metalcore records of 2003. Sheez, was I the only one who was paying attention that year? There were so many hard/mosh/metal/tough-guy/breakdown-happy/whatever-the-heck-you-wanna-call-`em-core bands that released albums that year, there's no way that reviewer's opinion should be taken seriously. Maybe "Haymaker" had a tiny bit of novelty upon first listen, but I'll die before I say this C.D. has aged well. To compare this horribly unoriginal "music" to the quality of music produced by the likes of the previously mentioned Biohazard, Hatebreed, Terror, Chimaira, Devildriver, Black Dahlia Murder, and especially the almighty Lamb of God (all of whom released new music that year), is beyond silly.  Throwdown are, at best, interchangeable and negligible when compared with any one of those said bands. Even the worst of those above-mentioned bands makes this So-Cal quartet sound laughably amateurish. They can shred the pants off Throwdown any day of the week; they're so much smarter, more mature, capable, meaningful, advanced, complex, creative, unique, and easier to take seriously.  Aside from lacking any identifiable trait, "Haymaker"'s biggest flaw is that it is simply, well, simpleton. Hardcore has never exactly been a thinking meathead's forte, but listening to this might actually make you lose I.Q. points. The songs may sound fairly loud, but in all truthfulness, there's nothing "brutal" about these four twentysomethings. One could even argue they're not real metalcore -- because a true metalcore band would SOMEHOW be related to actual heavy metal. These guys are not. And that's a shame, because they're not much better at hardcore, either. All respectable bands who currently reside under that genre's label know how to riff somewhat well. Yes, some bands (Terror, for example) are better at it than others, but these guitar parts aren't even "riffs" at all. Tommy Love, the guitarist at the time, clearly has only a very rudimentary understanding of his instrument. But the band jumped to a major label (Trustkill Records), which supplied him with a polished, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-production to help hide his lack of skill. Now all he had to do was downtune his axe as much as possible, and voila! His ginormous, grumbling, sometimes grinding power chord patterns have a crushing effect. Too bad there's no disguising how mind-numbingly uninteresting, basic, and repetitive they really are. As a result, the music is thunderously loud, but the songs don't ever go anywhere, and the momentum is permanently stalled.  The group's frontcrybaby, Dave Peters' vocals are equally as bad. For starters, there's only so much of that throaty, "I'm a tough guy" yell anybody can listen to. But surprisingly, this band's vocal style can't even match that of their peers. Take Unearth's Trevor Phipps, for example: the guy's a pest to listen to, but his vocal style has at least some believable emotion, urgency, and personality. By comparison, Peters is completely empty, lifeless, lazy, uncommitted, and apathetic. It's like he doesn't even bother trying to sound remotely real or decent.   Furthermore, his lyrics...my, oh my, his lyrics! On "You Can't Kill Integrity," the listener is treated to such intelligent, touching melodrama as "That's all there is left to say; but I've got one thing left to say...'you're dead to me!'"; but he cheers up by track twelve, "Step It Up," so he can try to be supportive of his fans (by bellowing a command--"You've got to believe in yourself!"--at them). Props for trying to be positive, but it's a very cliche (how many times have we heard Jamey Jasta say something like that?), and it still falls way short of being powerful, heartfelt, inspiring, and intelligent, and memorable. Finally, "Declare Your War," we're forced to sit through an episode of Peters hurling unamusing gang shouts of "F you!" back and forth between some other nameless knucklehead. (That shouldn't be suprirsing, though, because pretty much the whole album is littered with completely-out-of-place and inappropriate expletives.)  Put simply, "Haymaker" is a pitifully lifeless, fake, hollow, pointless, and heavily flawed piece of music. It's the sound of the music-industry putting a group of unqualified losers in the same room to create a "metalcore" band, all just for the sole purpose of raking in a few bucks while the iron is hot (while this type of music is popular). Throwdown have almost everything they needed to be successful: a group of angry young men and a big record label to market their product. Problem is, they have never had any kind of talent, creativity, intelligence, heart, spark, chemistry, personality, and a soul. This album is almost--but not quite--good enough to merit receiving insults like   "pathetic," "generic," "unnecessary," "boring," "grating," "exhausting," and "hopelessly uninspired."  The members of Throwdown might as well be robots that punch in for work at the recording studio at 9 AM and finish recording the whole record by 5 that afternoon. They're always really livid--that much is obvious--but since the lyrics are so terrible, you don't know why, and thus, you couldn't care less that some ridiculously over-dramatic, attention-grubbing clown feels the need to yell his head off for over 50 minutes. After all, when even he can't he doesn't seem to know what he's talking about, why should anyone take this album seriously? This is a hollow shell of a real band: no personality, just fabricated emotion that was made up in order to be as popular as the rest of today's metal bands. The album may try to interest (or intimidate) first-time listeners with a massive wall of mind-numbing guitar crunch, less-than-one-dimensional vocals, and idiotic lyrics, but once you get passed these things, all that's left is a harmless, useless, instantly forgettable piece of garbage. Even the band don't bother getting excited about their own music, so why should we? Why should anyone take them seriously, is a better question? Throwdown get by on overwhelming volume, corny, inoffensive anger (neither of which will appeal to any well-adjusted person over 13 years of age), some decent hooks (which vanish from memory ten seconds after hearing them), and an overall decent performance by the drummer (which alone prevents the album from getting a zero-star rating from me). It makes for a tolerable listen while you're listening to it, but it becomes painfully clear that you just wasted the better part of an hour as soon as it stops playing.  Stay away. For the love of all things good, PLEASE tell everyone to stay away from this at all costs 
 As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity 
 I read the original BFL and found it to be fantastic, so when I saw a BFL for women I was thrilled, without a second thought I bought it.  It has good concepts like dividing women's life into phases, but that's it.  Even though the author tried to appeal to women, I found the original BFL much more motivating.  Maybe this book is OK for women who have not read other books or who have not followed a single program, but for me it was dissappointing, I felt much more involved with a male author than by a woman!!! Program lacks stucture, I can't  imagine what a man would think about this book!! 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 If you are buying this video because you are in love with the car commercial, or have seen the Bose promotional video, don't buy this KODO because that is not on this video. The video begins with a nice intro, then goes into a very long sequence where two very athletic and talented fellows play the largest drum for a very long time. Just when you think you can't possibly stand to watch them play the same sequence any more, they switch drummers, and start the whole thing over again. Then they do the same thing again. Just when you are ready to turn this video off, then another nice sequence comes on with some girl drummers. Unfortunately, that sequence only lasts a very short time, then they bring out the big drum again. I loved the commercial and would have loved to have had that on the video. I intend to resell my copy of this DVD as it was very disappointing to me 
 This book starts off well enough, with the author buying a house that has some oddities about it.  But then, the book fails to gel, and becomes progressively disjointed. After several chapters of recounted dreams presented as occurances, I gave up and didn't finish it.    My impression is that the author really wanted to write a book, and she was also into ghosts, so she decided to start with a true life ghost story. The only problem: her material is thin.  She starts off well enough,  moving into a house with some creepy atmosphere.  But what follows is mostly dreams, anecdotes about noisy pipes and other settling noises and accounts of people who 'felt something'.  I never became convinced that the house was really haunted, or just that she really wanted it to be haunted.    Borrow this, if you have a lot of patience for amateur writing and efforts, and want to explore every possible ghost story.  It's too insubstantial an effort for me to recommend as a purchase.  
 This was on the board approved list for my school and I read it in hopes of teaching it to my class.  Sex, drugs, cheating, stealing and alcohol...there is a good  message, but it is hidden pretty deeply.  I would let students read this if they are advanced in maturity and had a good set of values, otherwise I would not want my teens to read this. 
  Only reading the first page is enough to understand where this writer comes from. Things were simply not as clear-cut as is stated here. The truth is that there was no legitimacy in the Spanish government way before February 1936. The author ommits (which in history amounts to a distorion of the truth) the October 1934 Socialist coup, where whole towns were sacked and destroyed by the -previously heated up with propaganda- masses of the Socialist Unions, the Socialist Party and the everpresent Communists.   What all this book amounts to could have been reduced to the typical one or two socialist insults: "Death to capitalism", "Fascists!", etc. It would have saved people some money. These anti-system lunatics out of fancy universities don't dupe people anymore.   God save Americ 
 VERY DISSAPPOINTING,HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KICKBOXING SAGA,A PRODUCTION THE COULD OF DONE WITHOUT,DAVID SLOAN DIES.........LOL.COMMON REALLY EVEN I COULDNT BELIEVE IT,SEE THE MOVIE FOR A GOOD LAUGH,NOTHING ELSE 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 I think this book was over written with a lot of fillers to make the book seem longer.  There was a lot of unnecessary off the topic information to read that did not help to convey the lives of the autistic adults.  I don't believe that the author has autism because he skips so many parts of his own childhood to only express what has happend to his classmates.  Its amazing that the 4 autistic adults have successful careers and yet no one talks of the struggles they should have had to make it through elementary, high-school and college. The most informative information the author could have given parents like me with a child with autism is truely how where they able to learn to read and write and speak.  It just doesn't happen overnight without a process.  All the adults seemed to have been mainstreamed by middle school with no explanation of their struggle through school. I question if this book is true 
 In this book, the lives of four people intersect and are woven together.  The initial descriptions of the four people--two recently released convicts, a woman whose husband has committed suicide, and a police officer--are interesting and promise an intriguing story.  Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there.  The characters are manipulated in an artificial manner, and the interactions are forced and wooden.  I agree that the writing is surprisingly amateurish at times and a good editor would have caught the awkward phrasing and helped improve it.  This is not Danielle Steele's best work 
 This second part of Xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part, regardless of what anyone says.  I no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes.  The game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non-intuitive battle system.  Annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy, including the very first one.  Battle result and saving screens are a painful chore.  Battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets.  The game has very few items, weapons, or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies, which are stronger than expected.  The skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy.  Battles with main enemies are long, which isn't such a problem.  However, they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle, just to frustratingly finish off a battle-weakened party.  Voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying.  I don't remember any music from this game, so plain it is.  Some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first Xenosaga.  Very noticeable is the use of swearing, which is the main reason I don't enjoy or watch Hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore.  New, meaningless characters have been introduced into the story, and the focus shifted far away from the main characters.  The cover character hardly says or does anything this time.  There is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment, but if you blink you will miss it.  This game is far more frustrating than challenging, which is not a good game trait.  I don't recommend even playing this game before reading the above, to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits.  If you're looking forward to anything that made the first Xenosaga great, you will be extremely disappointed.  The second Xenosaga is better completely avoided. 
 This book is awful.  I had it for a DOE course.  The professor and the text were useless.  There were lots of useless derivations.  It was difficult to quickly look up equations or main points.  The author just blathered on and one.  USELESS!  I learned more from using google.com 
 Although I've never picked up a Mickey Spillane novel before, I wanted to give him a try. After reading Something's Down There, I have to assume that his earlier works are a lot better, because this book couldn't have built his reputation.  Mako Hooker is a sailor (or is he) who seems to want a quiet retirement in the islands. When a mysterious creature begins attacking boats in the area, he's forced to contend not only with the beast, but a film crew that wants to capture it and some shadows of his own past. The biggest problem with this book is that Spillane doesn't seem to know what he wants this story to be. Sometimes it's a detective story, sometimes a crime drama, sometimes it's a Hollywood farce and sometimes its a godawful monster movie. Hooker is cut right out of the tough guy handbook, as is his love interest, and his sidekick (who, in nearly 300 pages, never stops calling Hooker "sar" despite repeated protests both from the character and the readers to knock of the bad accent) is just plain annoying.  I want to give Spillane another try. Maybe a Mike Hammer book or something. I can't imagine that his normal style is like this -- overwritten, boring and completely without excitement 
 I have not yet to see how it looks like in the inside. Not all products show the inside of a book or baby book. And i would like to look at it before i buy. Even if the other costumers liked it 
 This book is easily the most insulting thing that I have read in a good long while. The author is curiously espousing feminism with one hand and slapping it in the face with the other.   Married? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Gay? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Disabled? Make a joke of it so no one has to feel uncomfortable! Children? Should be unseen and not heard, especially on campus! Fat? Lose weight or you'll get discriminated against! Attractive? Make yourself unattractive so your students won't hit on you! Huh?   Sorry, the academy needs to change certainly, but the only effective way to do that is to become the change ourselves and not hide behind the rhetoric of victimology that this author advocates. 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
 When Disney Interactive released "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. "Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." "I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire." If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort 
 I bought the book and was let down about how dated the stories were during the days of the Iron Curtain.  The book dedicates only one real chapter to the issues that have faced couples meeting since the fall of the Soviet Union and impact of the internet.  Secondly the book almost exclusively deals with the marriages of childless couples.  To ignore the impact of children from the Former Soviet Union, coming with their Mom in a package deal, is to underestimate the challenges of the marriage and the stress it will place on the relationship.  Lastly while the book is collection of stories, it offers little advice and mostly annidotes.  The "Culture Shock" books on Amazon and internet articles were far more helpful to prepare me for the challenges of this type of marriage 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out 
 I buy a lot of books from amazon, and I rarely make any comments. The material and style of this book are outdated, and it is vague on content. The authors should make a revised version, or the book should no longer be printed.  Bottom line, do not buy it! I am returning my copy. 
 this is the worst performance i've ever seen. i guess this is a pilot for a tv-show that wasnt picked up. good riddance 
 This book is so cliche'It is full of the things you are probably thinking about by looking at the cover. If you want a story about a woman's struggle, find it elsewhere. This book is only for people who can't get enough of Appalachian literature. I found it to be so terribly boring and full of "appalachianisms" that I wanted to vomit. Besides this, there is far too much generalization in here. It would be more fun wathching someone pull my fingernails out than reading this again. 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Rambling incoherant plotlines, cardboard cutout characters, and highly tedious prose made this the second worst book I ever attempted to read 
 The patterns in this book are ugly beyond description. There is nothing here that I would dream of knitting either for myself or anyone I know. More importantly, since the attractiveness of a design is a matter of taste, the Carron book's instructional value pales in comparison with that of Barbara Walker's Knitting from the Top, which has been reprinted and is readily available. Walker's designs are often unattractive as well as dated, but her instructions leave the knitter quite capable of creating whatever s/he can imagine in seamless, top-down garments. Attempting to follow in Walker's footsteps is difficult. The Carron book doesn't come near to that standard. 
 I had Vol. 3 be Jay-Z's worst. Even though it is a Jay Z album, there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek, Talib Kweli, and Amil. Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff.  Jay-Z puts some good material despite, like "I Just Wanna Love U".   Not a good album. Very commercialized. Don't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan 
 I was extremely disapointed with the content of the book.  I definitely can't say that I would be able to build a log home with the insufficient information provided.  I found explanations were confusing, unclear and not detailed at all.  It seems that the author is assuming everybody knows how to build a house.  There was not enough pictures or images to illustrate some of the most important steps of making a log home (e.g. scribing the logs...).  I find this book may be interesting to get familiar with the basics of log building but it's definitely not a technical reference for a builder wannabe 
 Fontane's examination of upper class Germany in the nineteenth century ultimately proves to be a scathing indictment of the "me first" mentality, but, and this is important:  NOTHING HAPPENS.  For about 200 pages Fontane wastes the readers' time by doing what could be done in about 30 pages:  He shows how messed up the whole aristocratic scene was.  Yeah, so they commit adultery an lie to each others face, you don't have to drag it out for so damn long.  All in all, it makes me feel good to NOT be a rich upper class waster.  And once the hammer drops (about 35 pages before the book ends) it still doesn't matter that Fontane has built these characters up:  They are all the same exact characters in different bodies.  I didn't feel anything for Effi or Instetten or anyone else except Roswitha, and her only because her dad chased her aroudn with a red-hot poker when she was a young girl 
 This Deluxe Edition DVD has the worst case of cross-color artifact I have seen on any DVD movie so far. It has a "Mastered in Hi Definition" sigh on the back of the DVD; well, it may be mastered in high definition, but they obviously used a composite source and a terrible color decoder. This artifact is really very obvious on a big plasma TV, and my DVD player's "Cross-Color Suppression" filter could not remove it completely 
 UNFORTUNATELY (are you listening, Amazon?) while you can revise text of ratings, once you make an initial review, you can't revise upward or downward the number of stars you give.  Else, as I get further into this book, it would now be a ONE-STAR rating.  I'm going to name the two historical religious myths that Stark printed as Gospel truth (pun intended) right off the bat, since as an ex-Lutheran, I caught them immediately standing out like a sore thumb.  1. Luther NEVER said "Here I stand" at the Diet of Worms. 2. Luther quite likely NEVER nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. (He never mentions doing such a thing in his own lifetime, and that story was first told after his death.)  For a professor of religion at a major university (a major Christian university now, even more sadly) to uncritically print these two legends as fact puts the whole book "on notice," so to speak. (In fact, it puts ALL of his books "on notice" that careful reading and a high dose of skepticism will likely be needed.)  =====  Second, chapter 2 of this book, where it works to provide a corrective to old ideas about the "Dark Ages," has multiple problems.  First of all, Stark is tilting at windmills here. It's been two decades or more since just about any serious scholar has held to his straw man that the "Dark Ages" were real and horrible, and three decades or so since a majority of scholars has held more enlightened positions.  Next, and much worse, in his windmill-tilting, Stark AGAIN makes clear historical mistakes, under talking about the Middle Ages as a font of Christian European technological advance. In short, Chapter 2 becomes a chapter of Christian Apologetics and NOT medieval Christian history.  I look at three instruments whose Christian European invention or development is overplayed by Starks.  1. Stirrup. Although he never directly says "The stirrup is a Christian European invention," he certainly implies that. Fact: the Central Asian Alans brought stirrup-equipped cavalry to Europe in 5th-6th century invasions. Fact 2: The first Europeans to adopt use of the stirrup were the pagan Swedes, it appears. Fact 3: And, contrary to his assessment of the value of the stirrup in Charles Martel repelling the Saracens at Tours, modern research says that the stirrup mainly allowed left/right tilting; its value in shock lance assaults has been overestimated.  2. Cannon. Wiki notes that a Chinese Buddhist mural pictures a cannon in 1128, two centuries before the battle of Metz, where cannon were supposedly first used. Now, that's not to deny that much of cannon's development happened in Europe, but, let's not oversell the case.  3. Compass. Stark claims that the compass was likely invented separately in Europe and China, rather than coming to Europe from the east, and that China never used it for navigation. Well, the Arabs did so use it, a century before Europeans. That would indicate the assimilation theory of European discovery, not invention of the compass is correct.  =======  The book gets worse from here.  Stark blames 1860s religious opposition to Darwinism by Bishop "Soapy" Wilberforce and others as only being a purely defensive reaction to a "virtual Who's Who of Socialism ... the earliest and most militant proponents of Darwinism."  Excuse me, Mr. Stark, now who's guilty of historical revisionism, with a generous side course of mudslinging thrown in for good measure?  ====  Plus, Stark operates with the same blinkers as to a definition of "Christianity" as he claims historians do who only attribute good things to post-1500 Protestant Christianity.  From reading this and other books, you would never even know that the Orthodox tradition of Christianity even exists. This is SHAMEFUL for someone who holds himself out to be as scholarly as Stark does.  Now, if he had put "Western" before the word "Christianity" throughout his book, it would be different. But he doesn't, and instead must again be seen as practicing some form of willful deception.  ====  That said, up to that point, I did learn a couple of things -- how good a case the Donatists had, and the Spanish Muslims' 1418 proscription of Jews. However, I have no doubt that I could learn either of those from another religious history book written within the last decade.  That said, I found many of his definitions in his introduction to be somewhat idiosyncratic.  Magic, for example, will be defined by other scholars of religion in such a way that does not exclude the divine. In fact, things such as incantations are based explicitly on the idea of summoning a divinity while constraining it, by the power of the incantation, to do your will. And this divinity need not be seen as an "impersonal power," as he claims.  Defining religion as supernaturalist means he is ruling out Confucianism and Buddhism in forms that don't have a god at all, not just a god as "essence" vs. one as "person."  Also, his medieval dichotomy of the "Church of Power" vs. the "Church of Piety" cuts way too neatly. First, who says they're exclusive? Certainly, a reformist pope like Hildebrand (Gregory VII) wanted to advance both.  Anyway, there are surely nuggets of new historical fact to be gleamed besides the two I already did. And there may be in his other books as well. But, if they contain any whoppers like this, I'll look to other history/psychology of religions books besides Stark's.  =====  In short, unless you want your religious history book to have a generous dollop of "anti-PC" Christian apologetics at the top, or, if you're a conservative Christian seeking academic confirmation for an "us vs. them" mindset, feel free to skip this book, and thank me for the warning 
 Wow...where do I begin? This book is so, unbelievably stereotypical from start to finish. With the exception of the final (and somewhat redeeming) "twist" at the end, I found the rest of the novel to be a huge waste of paper. Malladi introduces us to a "typical" South Indian Brahmin family and is quick to throw in just about every negative issue you can think of when in need to criticize Indian culture. Dowry? Check. Chauvanistic alpha males? Got that too. Caste system? Arranged marriages? Abortions? Ethnocentricity? It's all here, in a convenient package for your reference. Honestly I'm surprised Malladi didn't throw in a depraved pedophilic uncle as well, just for good measure. The story has an unlikeable protagonist in Priya, who comes across as quite pretentious. It's a little hard to believe that someone who has lived away from her country for a mere seven years begins to question little things like wearing a salwar kameez to a bazaar. I myself am a born and raised Canadian of Indian descent and when I visit my grandparents in India, I have absolutely no problem with "doing as the Romans do". Why? Because it's what is done in the country. And seeing as most people respect the values of every European and Middle Eastern nation they visit, there should be no reason why one should not respect the values of this nation as well.  Priya goes on to fight with her mother. And then her grandparents. And then her aunt. And after this, miraculously, empowers every female in the house to "rebel" against the constrained, stifling, chauvanistic, primitive culture they exist in. Did I mention it was primitive? The truth is that many (if not most) South Indian Brahmin families already have relatives married to Americans; in fact, it has reached the stage where a lot of the older generation are quite pleased to hear that their grandchildren have done so (and if not, for the most part they just accept it). Malladi insists on portraying a family that apparently exists in the Stone Ages when it comes to all the aforementioned issues.  In addition, there is minimal, if any character development at all; Priya just traverses from issue to issue without attempting to see the other side of things. She does not mix the positive with the negative, or attempt to reconcile the reader with the fact that many of the issues faced in India are eerily similar to those in the US--caste discrimation? What about racial discrimination? Malladi could have done so much with this, especially considering that (spoiler ahead) Priya's fiance is black. She could have compared discrimination faced by lower castes to, say, Nick's experiences with discrimination (and I hate to disappoint you, but it still exists). In the world painted by Malladi, the main point of contrast is the "backward" ways of South Indians with the "inclusive, modern" ways of Americans (as represented by Priya).  Now, that's not to say that the book doesn't have its fair share of laughs. I had to smile at the deference of Priya's father to her feisty mother on a few occasions. The mango recipes also added an interesting touch, as did the final revelation of Nick's ethnicity (to remind one that being American does not necessarily refer to being white, as obvious as it may seem). It's when Malladi attempts to tackle the "serious" issues that the book fails (which is, sadly, most of it).  The bottom line? If you subscribe to the views voiced by Priya and enjoy one-sided arguments, you will probably love 'The Mango Season'. I suspect that this book will not particularly appeal to second-generation Indo-Canadians (or Americans) such as myself, however, since the issues being dealt with are so cliched and do not really apply to most of us (or our extended families in India for that matter). If you have a burning desire to read a book by an Indian author however, I would probably recommend 'The Namesake' by Jhumpa Lahiri. Though it does not tackle exciting topics such as dowries and beatings, it is a poignant look at the life of a Bengali family and the issues they face. Lahiri's prose is wonderful too.  Better yet, I would recommend reading a book on Indian culture and understanding the roots of "primitive" traditions before suffering books such as 'The Mango Season'. 
 I picked up this book from my library because the cover looked interesting and the blurb looked interesting. The book consists more musings and less research and organization. The author begins to tell a story or talk about a myth or idea, and then jumps from topic to topic, and we never see the end of her train of thought.   I stopped reading around Chapter 3, when the book turned to the "taboo" of being a redhead in the Elizabethan era without any mention of Queen Elizabeth being a redhead - not to mention that red hair during this time was actually quite fashionable 
 I am a professional pastry chef and I found that most of Mr. Malgeri's recipes are avaiable in many other books ...in other words they are neither unique or unusual ...and many of the recipes are just not very good representatives of their "TYPE"...I would not recommend this book.  I would recommend "The Good Cookie" by Tish Boyle...better  recipes and better writing 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 alright, I was forced to read this book as part of the 10th grade English ciriculum at my school these past three weeks, and I must say this is the single worst book I have had the misfortune of reading. First off, I understand that Gibbons was trying to emulate the writing style of the 9-10 year old southern girl in older times, but the style only made reading the book that much more of a chore. My main quip with this novel is exactly that, it is a novel. This is not a true story, this is fiction, and I must say that for fiction, it is incredibly boring, uneventful, and tiresome. The formula for chapters or sets of chapters usually would consists of something unfortunate happening in her "past life" as I will call it, then switching back to talking about her new life as a foster child and the incredibly ordinary events of that life, then repeat. The book's monotonus pace, along with its uneasy readability put me to sleep while reading it. Twice. Basically nothing happens in the story that makes it any more exciting or depressing. The wole thing seems to just be dragging on to no climax or end, and when it finally does finish, it stops at a point that at any other point in the book could very well have been the end of any chapter, followed by more of its nonschalant happenings. Maybe I'm missing the whole "young girl overcomes adversity and grows as a person" bit -which I know that some people are fond of-, but if that's all that this book is offering, a small insight into an imaginary girl who had a tough upbringing and the daily grind she endures, then this book really to me has no point in being written.   thank you for reading the rant of a 16-year-old fuled by the over-analyzation of an overly-simple book 
 Today I looked at the genuine leather edition of the ESV single column. I love the translation, and the format. But the paper is so thin there is ridiculous bleedthrough. Since the print is only 10 pt, a crisp and clean page is critical for readability. Because the paper is so thin, it is easy to read the opposite side of the page!   Additionally, the leather and the binding seem less than ideal.  I have waited a long time for a side-column edition of the ESV, and it looks like I will have to wait even long for another publisher to produce one. Why Crossway would go to all the trouble of producing a new edition only to use such an inferior paper is beyond me 
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo 
 SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME 
 I agreed with previous low rating reviewers, while this book is good motivation read it lacks detail on how to find and evaluate good business opportunities. I find it amusing how the Author denounced investment in equities and yet happy to put money in Options. Further, throughout the book (every couple of pages) the author shameless promotes his other books which I found very annoying. The repetitiveness of certain topics (i.e. how trillion was lost during 2000-03) forces me to skip pages of the book 
 Out of all the cr appy punk-pop bands that have come out since Green Day, Simple Plan have to be the worst of the entire bunch! The band basically invented the whole "let's write songs about our awful lives and call it emo". Another thing, can you really name any members of this band other than Pierre Bouvier? Don't worry, you don't need to. Nothing about this pile is good from the whiney lyrics to the lame guitar playing of Jeff Stinco(okay I can name one but that's it).  A lot of people describe Simple Plan's lyrics as "poetic" and "emotional". Here's some lyric examples:  "Yesterday was the worst day ever,  And tomorrow won't be better it's history repeating  On and on  Summer plans are gone forever  I traded them in for dishpan water  And everyday is never ending  I need to work I'm always spending"  "I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair  Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is  Having more fun than me  (Tonight)"  One of the worst parts as well is Pierre's horribly whiney voice. It sounds like this: "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! MYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy LIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiifffffEEEEEE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuccccccccccccKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!" *ears start bleeding*  So here we end yet another review of yet another very cr a p py album by a very cr a p py band. Thus say The Metal Master 92... 
 Very disappointing, especially after the rave reviews on the back cover. The book is little more than a vehicle for Ballard's much aired views on suburban alienation. These views are done to death in this book. The dialogue is absurd, the plot is risible, the characters cardboard and the prose style is tired. I don't recommend it 
 Mr. McDevitt's treatise on Tactical Medicine is just that - a treatise.  Although he covered many areas of tactical EMS, most were just touched upon and certainly not enough information was supplied to educate uneducated or to inform the active practitioner.  The book has no scientific references.  It appears to be purely anecdotal.  Any firm fact to be found there is interspersed with unfounded opinion.  To the uninformed, the difference between fact and opinion would be difficult to sort out, to say the least 
 Save your money on this one. They ALWAYS seem to skirt the issue as to HOW right now. I'd recommend getting Personal Power II by Anthony Robbins - they both teach relatively the same work, but with diff. words - semantics  some would say 
 Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine written by Voronica Whitney-Robinson with Haden Blackman was the first Star Wars novel published based on a videogame. When I hear about an upcoming movie or novel based on a game, I tend to believe that it will likely be a shallow, cash-in type of affair. Unfortunately, with this novel, that is indeed the case. The feel of the book is that of an overlong and not very compelling advertisement for the massively-multiplayer Star Wars Galaxies game, rather than being a quality read that stands on its own.  The storyline concerns Dusque Mistflier, an Imperial bioengineer who falls in with a mysterious apparent Rebel sympathizer named Finn Darktrin. Dusque is uncertain of the morality of her job and fears the Empire is using her research for nefarious ends. The sudden loss of her closest comrade at the tender mercies of Imperial Stormtroopers throws her over the edge and she's suddenly off on the run with Finn trying to round up a missing holocron for the Rebel Alliance. As they adventure together, a plot twist is foreshadowed MANY times to a point where I can't believe a single reader wouldn't see the ending of the novel coming from miles away.   Dusque and Finn are largely generic character-types like you would find in your typical videogame. They are assigned small quests and have random encounters just like a game. They have boss fights and missions just like a game. In short, there's no organic flow to their story: it feels like arbitrary plot points strung together. Adding to this in a negative way is the shoe-horning into the plot of almost every main film character from the classic trilogy. Vader shows up twice, Luke and Leia bop in and out, Han and Chewie are randomly flying escort to Dusque and Finn at one point, C-3PO is assigned to be a pathfinder droid for the duo (!), and Lando shows up just because a scene takes place in a casino. These cameos add nothing. I did enjoy the cameo of Nym, the pirate from the Starfighter videogames; he felt like a more natural addition to this story, even though he didn't really have anything to do.  The key plot point is hard to reconcile. Would the Rebel Alliance really be so foolish as to encode a holocron (typically a device only used by Jedi or Sith in the rest of the EU) with a full contact list of every spy in their network? This defies the whole concept of organization by cell and doesn't seem very likely. To top it off, they lose this fantastically critical asset and it ends up stuck in a fire pit in a cave? I find this difficult to swallow.  One of the interesting aspects of the book is how frequently it delves into biology and zoology. We are treated to a veritable parade of fauna as the story winds along. Whitney-Robinson has worked as a veterinary assistant and as a marine biologist, so it's easy to see where this focus came from. It does lend the book a bit of much-needed character and distracts from the cardboard-cutout main characters.  I take no joy in writing a review this negative but I simply didn't find much to like about Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine. Thankfully, this book didn't stop Del Rey from trying a second book based on a videogame, Karen Traviss' superb Republic Commando: Hard Contact. The difference in readability and insight in the novels is dramatic, and I'm not surprised that Traviss was asked to start producing Republic Commando sequels, as her books don't read like a game at all. I'm sorry to say that I could only recommend The Ruins of Dantooine to someone obsessive enough to have to read every Star Wars novel written like myself. 
    Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene "coming of age" wannabes.  It has been done much better in "Johns" and in Showtime's "Queer As Folk."   Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment.   Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief.  This movie has nothing to recommend it.  No stars is my rating.  But, thanks, Amazon, for finding me a buyer of my DVD copy through my Marketplace selling account 
 This writing is what brings out the positivist in the best of us.  Nonsense from beginning to end. What would Wittgenstein not say 
 Who wouldnt want a better profile?  I was very excited with my purchase, however I was quickly disapointed.  The sling hurt and didnt fit my private area comfortably.  After one wash, the underwear shrunk.  Love low rise, but these pair were too low.  My crack was showing!!!!!  
 I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't.  There were too many occasions where the author asked me to suspend my disbelief so that the plot could continue.  How do the same people end up always finding each other?  The relationship between the main characters made me very uncomfortable, and I am not a complete prude.  The way love in most forms was presented in this novel was completely disheartening, and as a mother, the way that children were portrayed in this work was difficult to stomach.  I understand that the idea here is that we are all destroying our world, and given the chance to do it all again we most likely would make the same stupid mistakes, but there were very few characters to like or admire in this book.  I really didn't care if they made the same mistakes we make every day...frankly I was hoping to see the last of all of them very soon 
 Actually, I found Kathryn Davis' "Versailles" to be very well-written, but as the author herself admits, she was never interested in history in school, and it shows. I think she should stay away from  the historical genre, and focus on possessed doll houses and other arcania. After reading the very authentic and exciting novels about Marie-Antoinette and her family by Elena Maria Vidal, I kept asking myself if  Ms. Davis was indeed writing about the same people. There was hardly any resemblance at all. How could Louis be so flabby if he was always hammering away at his forge and horseback-riding and hunting? And yet Davis persists on describing him as such. One cliche after another, and charmless cliches....Antonia Fraser in her biography "Marie-Antoinette: The Journey" says that Louis did not really have a phimosis or require surgery at all to consummate the marriage so I wonder if Davis did the most basic research. Antoinette wanders about in a vague, hazy paradise, not really in touch with anything or anybody, so different from the dynamic, engaged queen who organized charities for the poor. Davis has her saying that it doesn't really matter if she and Count Axel von Fersen were lovers or not. I guess it would have mattered very much to her husband...and to the Count, too. The title of the novel after the palace where Antoinette lived made me nostalgic for warmth and intimacy depicted in Vidal's "Trianon," named for her private retreat, which is scarcely mentioned in Davis' book. And I missed the supernatural element in Vidal's books, as well, although Davis makes some attempts to capture the mystical aspect of the queen's confrontation with death and life, quoting the queen's dead profligate father, who said, "There is naught save eternity that is without end." But no extremes of good and evil here, no exploration of what her tragic life was really about, just a depressing depiction of a lost, clueless woman 
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 I am a minimalist to the fullest, but this book simply lacks depth. The "blueprints" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, "PREFAB" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, "Pierre Koenig", by James Steele or "Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography" by Peter Gossel. Ta T 
 I thought this book would be more autobiographical and less of his personal opinions about life.   I got bored after only a few chapters and skimmed the 2nd half of the book.  Unfortunately, SP is not a good writer and it SHOWS.  The book skips from one time period to the next and back again without much rhyme or reason to it.  I am a big fan of his acting and this was a real disappointment.   Don't bother with this one.  
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 Gore Vidal is a pretentious blowhard. (Like that's big news.)While I have always been fascinated by the whole Tennessee Williams-Truman Capote- Vidal connection, and, individually, respected and appreciated their talents, I just couldn't get into the erudite "man of letters" blase' musings about the burden of his genius, poor thing.  He has always reminded me of that brief character in "Catcher In The Rye" (Vidal would probably dismiss Salinger as an unprolific flash in the pan, better to write lots of crap), the one to whom, when asked his opinion of something rather trivial, has to STAND BACK, to give himself and his all-important answer lots of room. This is a one note memoir, a B flat, B for "Bitchy". Even his recollections of certain personalities I'd otherwise be curious about were overshadowed by his obnoxious arrogance. His memory (fantasy ?) of a sexual liasion with Jack Kerouac is especially repugnant, his take on this and most of his sexual experiences supposed to impress upon us that, because he is literally and figuratively always "the man on top", that he is still "all man". While I did respect and enjoy somewhat the then innovative "City And The Pillar", and thought "Myra Breckinridge" a hoot, I don't like to have to keep a dictionary next to me to get through a book. And, while my favorite reads have always been  bios, auto- bios, etc..I always find that, even when they're about some of the most revered, there has to be some element ( a TITCH would do) of humility. I don't imagine Mr. Vidal would be too heartbroken to know that this un-employed restauranteur did not enjoy his lofty parchment from on high, but, hey....it WAS twenty-seven bucks ! 
 I do yoga and have done some Pilates.  I've actually got a pretty decent core, but the advanced moves on this DVD are most assuredly NOT appropriate for EVERYBODY.  It's not even an issue of doing less repetitions, because Denise Austin isn't doing that many repetitions of each position.  She doesn't give alternate moves or direction for beginners at any point during advanced moves, and she acts as each move is so basic that nobody could have any trouble with it.  This is terrible for beginners, who aren't even going to know how to modify the moves on their own to make them appropriate.    "Every body" would also make it sound as though the range of exercise was appropriate for somebody with physical limitations.  I have a mother who is short one abdominal muscle due to having tram reconstruction, and she has even had to undergo hernia surgery as a result of only moderate activity.  I could never recommend a DVD like this for her, despite the fact that Pilates in the hands of a good trainer is wonderful for rehabilitation or for those with limitations.  The reputation of Pilates for those purposes only serves to add to the danger of this poor presentation, and I sincerely hope nobody really injures themselves as a result.    The bottom line is: Don't just listen to condescending remarks from someone who thinks they know what everyone's body is capable of or that everyone has innate knowledge of how to adapt Pilates even without any form of instruction.  If you are a beginner, out of shape, or have any physical limitations... please don't judge this DVD by its title.  Find instruction from a good trainer or DVD that and will teach you correctly for your body.  Denise Austin's instruction is completely irresponsible, and the title for this DVD should be changed.  
 I thought I was buying a guide book to Eastern Oregon's wild country. Instead, I received a book filled with "green  propaganda", superficial information, misguided objectivety, and a warped perspective into what the "Eco Terrorists" agenda truly is for Eastern Oregon 
 After reading this book I didn't know how to react to much of it.  Many of the claims are plausible, many are wildly implausible, and some of the information is just plain factually wrong.  Sharon left the IDF in 1973, not 1970 as Menashe says.  Shamir retired or "was retired from" the Mossad in 1965 not the "early 1970s."  Ben-Menashe is the first person who claims that the IAF has B-52s--two squadrons no less--but he doesn't say where Israel hides these massive eight-engine bombers.  He also claimed that the murder of an old American Jewish cripple by Abul Abbas' organization on the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro was an Israeli plot to discredit the PLO.  Ben-Menashe doesn't really document any of his claims but asks us just to trust him.  His first whopper is to claim that Shimon Peres had been paid millions by Lockheed while defense minister.  Since all of Israel's American fighters were built by McDonnel Douglas or General Dynamics this seems highly unlikely.  Israel does use the Lockheed C-130, but the Lockheed scandal in Europe at the same time was to get the Belgians, Dutch, and Italians to purchase F-104 Starfighter interceptors.  This is typical of Ben-Menashe--he seems to take bits of news and spin it into a plot like a Hollywood screenwriter 
 Sheppard sets the stage for this weak book by entirely misconstruing the value of the two major 1990s Cohen biographies.  He says _Various Positions:  A Life of Leonard Cohen_ is for "besotted" Cohenites, whereas _Leonard Cohen:  Prophet of the Heart_ is for the more "literary" minded.  Turn this observation around and it makes sense, but as it stands it's the comment of a moron.  Ira Nadel's biography is kind to Cohen, to be sure, (he had Cohen's full cooperation, after all), but it is not the fawning piece of dreck that is _Prophet of the Heart_.  Nadel, in fact, uses _Prophet of the Heart_ as a source, for factual details and for some of Cohen's comments in it, but Nadel manages not to incorporate the syrupy crud that the folks who wrote _Prophet_ poured onto every page.  Sheppard needs to learn what excessive deference is before his writing will inspire 
 This tool holder is fairly bulky.  I couldn't find the single strong metal ones I was looking for and thought this would be a good substitute.  It doesn't hold out broom or mop (they slide out)so it is now holding two tennis rackets.  Would not purchase again 
 The book covers a fascinating subject because Porfirio Rubirosa was among the top playboys of his day. However, the writing style of author Shawn Levy is of the tabloid variety with little to back his ever-present purported subjective hypothesis and lame attempts at humor.  A straightforward biography with fleshed-out facts would have been far more appreciated by this reader than the filler that comprised most of the book 
 Just returned from Thailand this week. We used this book (although the cover photo is different, so perhaps we had the previous edition). Some of the bungalow info was different (i.e. unrecognizeable from the book description), but they change so fast that's to be forgiven in any guidebook. What really irked me was the crazy light orange text colour for headings and numbers - trying to read in dim Asian lighting or the back of taxi was extremely difficult. Also, I found the maps oddly placed. Good size, though, and the transportation info was accurate 
 This is a neat book, but only two stars because of its design. 100 short chapters uncategorized and in no particular order, with no index. There is a table of contents, of course, but the chapters are in no order and the way the chapters are titled they are not easily scanned by the eye, especially across 4-5 pages of listings. It's fun to flip through the book at random for a short while, but it's impossible to refer back to something you found useful at a later date unless you want to turn page by page until you find it. This was really a preventable problem and it's a shame it had to made an otherwise great book frustrating 
 I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.  The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).  The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.  The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).  The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.  However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.   Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.  Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.   The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.  For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.  I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.  So, I give it two stars. *Yawn 
 I have every single album that Weird Al has ever made.  And I am not impressed by this one at all.  It lacks variety, and is overall boring and not creative.  I enjoy white and nerdy and weasel stomping day, but Close But No Cigar and Trapped In The Drive-Thru (waaay too long) are just crappy.  And Pancreas?  WTF? 
 This book is a good example of an author flaunting his formidable language skills instead of telling the story. In this book he digresses often into fanciful descriptions of things that do not have even the most remote relevance to the story.  Read an abridged version or watch the movie, but don't subject yourself to the unabridged version 
 Lovely expert dance choreography for the viewer to watch, but this video fails as an instructional tool. The styling tips in the introduction, such as how to ask and how to accept an invitation, are quite helpful. This is one of the few dance videos that I have viewed which addresses dancing etiquette. It is very annoying to have the man drag the woman into a closer dancing position when she has already set her distance for a social dance.  The man's movements are shown with the male dancer facing the camera. Teresa Mason does a poor job of explaining the dance steps. The woman's movements are never broken down, and she supposedly simply does the opposite, but in watching the video, you can see that that is not true, especially for the turns.   Running the video in slow motion does not help matters. Teresa Mason needs to give a clear step-by-step explanation; the male dancers should face away from the camera and slowly walk through the movements. Then the female dancer should walk through her part. The dancers should go through the steps together slowly once more, and then finally at normal speed.  The video shows a variety of dancing styles, but trying to follow and learn even the most basic steps is an exercise in frustration. 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 A History of Heaven by Jeffrey Burton Russell, takes a decidedly Christian approach to the idea of heaven, and its evolution through the ages - up until the writing of Dante, where he says, all things consummate were consociated and reworded into the current popular picture of heaven. Buying the book, I was expecting it to be a survey and evolutionary look at heaven and the idea of paradisiacal afterlife from Neanderthal to present societies, but instead it turned out to take a definite Christian approach. The author mentions in passing the ideas of Islam and Judaism, but informs the reader he knowledge of these cultures is limited so he will maintain his focus on the Christian Ideal. It is a great reader for those interested in the early Church and it's ideas on Heaven, including some speculative origins, but it is not a true "history" of heaven, limited only to the Christian Theology as well as the period 200BCE to about 1500CE. A good reader nonetheless 
 Superficially Evening's book appears to be all that anybody would ever need about Photoshop CS2.  In fact, it is an impossible introduction for people making the jump from a simpler program, say Elements 3.0.    The organizational structure is poor.    Many ideas are used before they are explained, a fatal flaw as a text, tho' excusable in a pure reference volume.  But "For Photographers" claims to be a text and not a reference.  Terms are slipped in for somewhere without adequate definitions.  And neither the table of contents nor the index are detailed enough to help somebody find most detailed topics.  I bought Scott Kelby's book after putting Evening's on the shelf, probably for good.  Kelby gives the info a photographer making the jump to CS2 requires, although his language is famously just a bit to glib 
 Chapter 2. Apparently I'm a member of "the Petrified Forest," a.k.a. those of us who have chosen not to have children. Now, despite Mr. Bronson's claim that "parenthood is on trial," in the world where I live as a married woman with no kids, parenthood is largely believed to be the default position everyone is expected to take, unless they are unmarried or medically infertile. Because that's the case, I'm aware that the decision not to have children is considered strange to some people, and would probably normally have passed this by. However, Bronson's raison d'etre here is the telling of people's life stories in order to "answer life's biggest questions." It strikes me as rather telling, then, that in the course of this he is willing to dismiss and stereotype an entire group of people, all of them individuals with their own reasons and their own stories, with a page of mockery and a glib label. If he's so casual and quick to judge on this issue, I can't really take the rest of his insights too seriously. 
 book is just a brochure for advertising a franchise of financial advisers and broker 
 I too had to purchase this book for a class. It did not help. There is too much information compacted into one paragraph. Then it is very reduntant. Each chapter seems to be repeating itself even though it is suppose to be on another subject of philosophy. I would not suggest this book to anyone. It was a good thing I had prior knowledge of philosophy so I could pass my class. If you know nothing of philosophy, this book will only confuse you more 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal. Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag. At first I thought it was a rock, but it looked like a garden snail. I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail! YUCK! I checked several bags and approx 50% of them had snails in them.  This is the worst tea experience I've had 
 It is often fun to overly critize films made in other decades that often reflect a different attitude to what worked for audiences then.  My memory of this film as a teenager stands up better than my views upon seeing this DVD resurrection. For instance, as soon as I saw the name Kurt Krasner in the credits this time, I recalled that it was a common practice to use certain actors over and over again, even though they were badly miscast each and every time.  Mr. Krasner is cast as a French policeman in Timbuktu.  The actor was often cast in exotic, foreign sounding roles.  The problem was that, in Legend of the Lost, he never attempted a French accent.  In fact, he never changed his accent or his delivery in any of his films. Ever! The fight scenes between Brazzi and Wayne (there are far too many of them) are amaturish; one camera angle actually shows Brazzi throwing a punch that misses Wayne's jaw by a good 12 inches!  Where was the director, Henry Hathaway, a seasoned vertan, when this happened?  The soundtrack element used for this DVD transfer was very poor; it has a thin, tin-like quality.  I've heard better in the various TV versions of this film. I find that to be true of many DVD's.  I'm glad I rented this DVD rather than simply relying on my memory and buying it outright.  That saved me some hard-earned money 
 I expected more, and better, from the ASPCA. This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat.  Really.  In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me.  The  information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty.  It was published  in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea  and heartworm prophylaxis.  The only good thing to say about this book is  that the photographs are beautiful.  Wish I could send it back and buy  something more informative 
 I have an abiding interest in homes on the sea. I've ordered a batch of them. When I saw this book, I assumed that it was a book about a variety of seaside homes of varying architectural styles. I was disappointed to find that it was a book about a single community in Florida, most of the homes being done in an architecturally consistent style. If you're looking for a book of relatively contemporary homes in Florida, this might be of interest to you, as it's well done from that perspective. Otherwise, I'd look at the other available titles, many of which are quite beautifully done 
 This seller put this book under the 11th edition and ended up sending me a 4th edition....the book is completely useless...beware!!!! 
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 This stuff isn't even worth $14.99.  My husband and my aunt couldn't even hear me.  It's a piece of crap. I sent it back the same day.  DON'T BUY IT!! 
 This recipe book was a gift and I am from the UK so I was excited to make some good british recipes but the format is so erratic and all over the place that it is hard to read. Maybe I am just used to Delia's books where if you are looking for an appetizer, you look under appetizer and voila but it takes ages to find what you are looking for. I would forgive that if the recipes turned out as described but I have made the fudge surprise cake twice now and followed the recipe to the tee and they were both a watery disaster, if you leave it in the oven for longer to dry it out, it comes out like cement and still has water floating on top. Dissapointing when you spend a small fortune to use valhrona and $$powdered cocoa 
 Andrew Mango is a well-known denier of the Armenian Genocide and this book is unfortunately predictable both in the facts it highlights or suppresses and in its conclusions. He glorifies the Ottoman past of the country and (at best) denies without any evidence documented instances of suppression of non-Turkish ethnicities. The most disturbing feature of the author's approach is the indifference to human suffering he exhibits throughout the book. For example, deniers of the Armenian genocide typically make sure to stress what a terrible tragedy the death of so many thousands of people was, even though they deny the characterization 'genocide'. Not A. Mango. He barely mentions the events of 1915, but he spends pages and pages condemning "Armenian Terrorists", Armenian conspiracies etc. Any qualities of the book are unfortunately dwarfed by such exhibits of callousness and blaming of the victims 
 This book took me all of 30 minutes to read. I can't believe that the list price is $17, because it's not worth it. Just borrow it from the library, like I did. I will admit that the book has some good photographs to give you ideas for makeup looks, but that's about all it has to offer. The tips aren't anything special, and will probably only be helpful to somebody who has never worn makeup before. And on just about every other page, the author is gushing about a certain color of product, saying, "This works great with all skin tones." I'm sorry, but not every color looks great on every skin tone. The author also seems slightly biased toward warm makeup tones, rather than cool. There are several references to "warming up" someone's coloring, and many of the makeup looks lean heavily toward peach and gold tones. There was also a ridiculous section on glitter in makeup where they tell you to mix actual glitter in with your regular eyeshadow. Are they kidding? This is a good way to get glitter in your eyeball. Why not just buy an eyeshadow that's already sparkly? There's no shortage of those 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
      If you are an intellectual idiot, you will love this book!  It waters down every important philosophical idea to the predjudicial opinions of one man who basically tries to use moral persuasion to "sell" his point of view but never backs up any of his "quotes" with footnotes of the "great philosphers" he is trying to "teach" us about!  NO DIRECT QUOTES!!  Yikes. Who can take this book seriously?       I don't think Plato would appreciate being watered-down in this way with neither footnotes to his brilliant, original work, nor any index. NO INDEX!!  Ask yourself this one question before wasting your money on this book:  "Why do I need a philosophy book written by an amateur who doesn't even consider me intelligent enough to make an index for me at the back of this book so I can look up topics as I want to?"  If, for example, you want to look up Plato, and what pages mentions his work in this "philosophy book" by Mr. Adler, you can't because there's no index.        As a classical homeschooler for the past nine years, I have to say I would NEVER ask my teenagers to read this book.  It's just not a serious enough philosophy book to waste their time with.  They are better off reading bits of Plato in the original than hearing the predjudicial opinions of Mr. Adler who's preaching, persuading, and glossing over details would make the money and time spent on it a total waste.  If you still want to read it, go to the library where it's free and decide then and there whether it's worth it.        It's simply unacceptable to have neither footnotes nor index in a book such as this 
 Be careful if you're buying this book for college. The sellers usually do not indicate which edition they are selling - and anything older than the 4th edition will be completely useless to to you 
 Just what the world needs - someone writing a book on information that has not been fully researched on the subject of transgender.  A 'drag queen' does or does not mean or represent that 1 + 1 = 2.  Not all 'drag queens' are homosexxual.  Period.  Purchase a different book that has been resarch with today's information - not this one. 
 If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep 
 Her work is unreadable.  It's too bad she abandoned what she had accomplished with Erosion so many years ago.  She is good at convincing people of her importance and so no one will tell the truth about her work.  If someone does, that person risks being thought of as a bad reader.  But there is nothing to nourish the soul in her poems. Nothing to contemplate.  They are not even interesting technically. The passionate defenses she generates always make me think of "protesting too much."  Her work is like reading impenetrable critical essays.  And even critical essays can be written for pleasurable reading, with ease and style.  American poetry has gone down a wrong road by following her example 
 It seems that everyone says you just have to read this book, and it really probably is going to be a part of my library, but I'm not going to be re-reading it and referring to it again and again, and it didn't have any information the really impacted me - the Comedy Bible and the Comedy toolbox have been much more helpful to me.  What I didn't like about this book is his attitude - he is very condescending in general - and he just makes statements and doesn't back anything up - it's more like an outline than a book. "It's like he was trying to come up with a book and wrote out an outline and didn't do the work to fill in the spaces, no really,    ok - there might be a few lines that define one of his terms, but there aren't any examples, there's no organization, no index, it doesn't show me how to use that as part of my routine, it doesn't help me get organized, it's a terribly disorganized mess, and it doesn't really help me understand what to do and what not to do. It's like he wanted to make money on a book, but he didn't want to have to divulge any of his secrets, so it's like empty.   Yall are not going to like this, but I found it insulting.  But I did read it, and I am glad i got the book, but it wasn't HELPFUL to me - does that makes sense?  I am glad to have this as part of my library,  I think it has some good  ideas that it STARTS to talk about, but it only gives a few lines for each idea, which isn't enough to get all exited about.  I feel like this book has been so strongly marketed that I am supposed to like it, and each time i try to read this book, and I don't finish, each time, I come away feeling a bitter taste in my mouth, and I don't like his attitude, I think he just preaches at you and he's just not really very nice .  That's just my impression.  sorr 
 Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash... 
 This was a rather disappointing read, I enjoyed her writing style but it went into way too many descriptions, and I was more interested to see how the dialogue & the story will develop. The characters were well described and introduced, but nothing much really happened to them. The references to Tian Tian's upcoming death took away any thrill that would have caused, so the surprise was taken away. The encounters with her lover were not bad, the story was just not going anywhere. References to feminisim were weak and did not mkae for a good argument. I sadly do not recommend this book. 
 I am a huge disney fan and collector.  I have the other cd's from baby einstein to the cd of songs from the movies and my whole family loves them.  This cd was recorded in 1979!  It is a old man whom I don't find very pleasant.  I prefer the 'normal' childrens cd's.  I bought this cd and returned it within 15 minutes 
 This book was not of any help to me. It mentions all the aspects of business you need to be familiar with before starting one of your own, but it does not give any help on any of these aspects.  For example in financing your startup, it mentions geting a loan and using your credit cards. Honestly if thats the way to finance a business then you can add going on a diet and saving your lunch money. It goes on giving you mostly unintelligent information and advice like "buy a computer", "save rent, work from home". Put your money on another book and save yourself the trouble of reading it 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 Of all the Herbert Norris books I have read, this one suffers the most from his preconceptions and inaccuracies.  It is also the one that has suffered most from the passage of time, as subsequent archaeological  research has revealed errors in what was, in Norris's day,  "factual" information about costume.  The best thing about his  book, in my opinion, is the meticulous line drawings of brooches and other  items of period jewelry, but again, more recently published works contain  excellent, full-color photographs of the same or similar specimens.  Read  this book if you enjoy Norris's style, but do not accept anything in it  blindly as much of it is plain wrong 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there 
 I thought this book would be more autobiographical and less of his personal opinions about life.   I got bored after only a few chapters and skimmed the 2nd half of the book.  Unfortunately, SP is not a good writer and it SHOWS.  The book skips from one time period to the next and back again without much rhyme or reason to it.  I am a big fan of his acting and this was a real disappointment.   Don't bother with this one.  
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
 didn't list this for sale here because I would be ripping someone off. Tales fo the city was delightful, this is drive 
 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 Historians agree today that this book is responsible for the modern misunderstanding of Byzantium. Think of only what the labeling "Byzantine" means today. If you want to know more about Byzantium start with one of the books on the empire by Sir Steven Runciman 
 This book shows the dichotomy that exists in modern-day America between the cutthroat environment that supposedly exists in the private sector, and the easy-does-it culture fostered within the public sphere of schools, government agencies, etc...  The book makes the case that America's youth are basically coddled K-12, and end up playing catch-up during and after college when working in the free-market culture of the private sector.    These conclusions have been elaborated on before in other publications, and are only true to a certain degree.  For example, the author gives examples of how Americans working in the private sector excel and achieve like citizens of no other country.  The author forgets to mention that nearly all the successful industries in this country, especially those that have gone to spawn copycats in other countries, were and are all supported and protected by government largess.  For example, automobiles would only be rich men's toys today if it were not for all those roads and parking lots built by taxpayers.  Another example, US agriculture would not have survived the Great Depression and become the world's leader in food produce if not for the introduction of farm subsidies, government-funded agricultural research, government-operated satellites and weather stations to monitor the weather, and other government programs that directly or indirectly help farmers.  These and other established, successful private industries would be nowhere without some "coddling" from US taxpayers.  Even if we dismiss the previous points, I believe the author has only shown half the picture; specifically, the author does not fully examine the question of why "coddling" occurs in schools and students are not prepared for the competition of the "real world".  The answer to this question connects the dichotomy so well illustrated by the author.  Specifically, American adults are so busy surviving in the private sector that they have less time and effort to raise their kids to be good competitors themselves.  For example, the character traits that makes for successful businesses: willingness of employees to relocate, works long hours, toeing the company line, etc..., are exactly the worse traits to follow when trying to raise kids well.   Raising kids well means living in stable communities with low turnover - this means minimal relocation of employees by businesses.   Raising kids well means spending time with them, and not spending long hours at work.   Raising kids well means teaching them to stand up for what they believe in, not what their peers (boss, coworkers, etc...) want them to do.    This then is what the author has totally missed out on in this book; an explanation of how the dichotomy between private sphere hard-nosed competetion, and public sphere cushion jobs came about.  Because of this omission, this book is merely commentary and observation, and lacks insightful thought 
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 this is the most god awful movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Boring as all get out. Nothing interesting. Dawn of the dead without the humor. its HORRIBLE.  I was looking forward to this movie and I am so sorry to have to say it was probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life 
 I ordered this atlas because of the title Large Scale, it is however not the large scale version.  Returned to Amazon 
 My mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan, and for x-mas i thought i'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have. Man do i regret it. She NEVER plays it anymore. The puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks. The keys on the keypad are hard to push in, and if you don't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game-play is blah. Really, if you bought this for someone, it's the kind of present that they'd be happy with for all of a few hours. Then they'd let it collect dust. Like my mum is = 
 I'm with the reviewers who thought this book was ruined by the ending. I'm all for twists, but this was completely ridiculous and incongruous and dumb.  The book tells the tale of Hamptons small-time lawyer Tom, who had a brief career as a professional ball player. Apparently sometime in his youth, he dumped the woman he truly loved, Kate, who became a hard career lawyer in NYC. We know she's hard because she smokes, and has no friends, but in the end, they band together and find true love while defending a young black ball player from a multiple murder death-penalty charge.  It's twisting and turning and super derivative, but mostly it's satisfying. Until the last few chapters, when the writers throw in a major monkey wrench that turns the books into a joke.   I felt as if the entire reading experience was false, and a waste of time. Badly done. Cheap.   Patterson's books may not be the best, but they ususally don't make you feel this cheated

 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 Rush Limbaugh - the man most responcible for replacing the biased liberal media with the biased conservative media - giving millions of Americans false hope and dangerous half-truths.  I've had enough of this marketing phenomena known as "conservatism."  They have created a demographic group for the sole purpose of selling books and merchandise.  The anti-Clinton/Moore/Kerry books are the same junk as the anti-Bush/Cheney/Reagan books.  No on is interested in opening their mind  and learning-they simply want to reinforce their own shallow ideas, entertain themselves and feel comfortable in their own little imaginary world.  Forums hosted by so called Conservatives are run in the same close minded ways in which college liberals shout down any guest speaker with whom they disagree.  Meanwhile, the two parties (the only choice the American voter is given) are virtually the same when it comes to the most important issues.  Both parties are taxing and spending, and supporting the illegal invasion of America by Mexicans.  Big business is in bed with big government and they are both getting even richer by selling you books pretending to speak ill of each other.

 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 My god this is so bad and could have been good if it had a plot. The bad dude looks like something off H.R. Puff and Stuff and about as dumb as the smiley face at wallmart, witch is were I bought this P.O.S. for $5.50 and that was $5.40 to much. Stay away. Barr 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 I have tried three times to read this book - twice before I went to Greece and once since my return (hoping that it would be more meaningful to me after my own travels there). It wasn't, and I still haven't managed to get more than 100 pages into this long, rambling, formless work. There are some things in this book worth knowing, I suppose, but one has to wade through regressions, tangents, trivia and self-reflections to dig a kernel of real meat out of all the blather. In other words, this book just doesn't read. Nick Sullivan 
 I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend's daughter for her birthday. She loves the game, but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead. It started with the static for a while, but then while I was singing, it just died completely. I know I'm not a great singer, but I'm not THAT bad 
 I don't want to say I hate this album but, I won't say I like it either. For as long as it took for this to come out, I figured something may be worth looking at. In my opinion it's kind of boring. Most of the start of the album sounds the same. Without going overboard and writing a ridiculous long review. It's okay for the completist to add to the collection but, nothing really stands out. It's just Type O 
 This book is embarrassing.  In my opinion the Vault Career Guide to Marketing and Brand Management is a superior guide to careers in marketing.   Good luck 
 this movie is a great waste of time. with its annoying litle rich brat kids and one of them kills their new best friend and Diggs incestigates with the worst soutern accent in the world, plus he shouldnt of been in this whole mess. with a bitchy cast and a nowhere story, this'll please those people with less than zero brain 
 My going-off-to-college student is all the title implies. I wish, I wish, I wish the recipes lived up to the other reviews. This assumes you have more of a stocked kitchen to work with and will be interested in starting from scratch. There are actually words like "homemade mild tomato salsa" and "toasted pine nuts". There's alot of explanation...more words than recipes, I think. This is very readable, very cute, and looks like pretty good food, but not for the hungry, harried college student in a dorm who isn't going to roast peppers or go get fennel, celeriac or even fresh broccoli 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates.  For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers?  When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?  This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.  This book is supposed to be a "Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.  I was VERY disappointed with this book 
 This book is full of errors and contridictions. As mentioned by another reviewer, the hurricane entitled Lizzie originates off the Cape Verde Islands near Africa (paperback edition, pg 25 para 2), travels EAST (pg 104 para 1) WEST (pg 116 para 4) again EAST (pg132 para 4), SOUTHEAST (pg 144 para 6), all the while traveling in a straight line, as if on a railroad track (again pg 104, para 1). I always thought the Caribbean was west of Africa. Also, not necessarily an error but a bit misleading, the hruricane moves about 50 miles into Nicaragua and dies. This is from the east coast (pg 144, para 6), but later when discussing the damage there, the statement is made that next to Haiti, the WEST coast of the country is the poorest stepchild of the Western Hemisphere (pg 182 para 1) Another bit of confusion is the statement regarding service provided by Commodore Vanderbilt moving people across Nicaragua, CUTTING OFF HUNDREDS OF MILES BY NOT SAILING AROUND CAPE HORN BUT ALSO SAVING ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES BYPASSING THE ISTHMUS AT PANAMA. ????????????? A contridiction occurs when the book states that they will be pumping the South Equatorial Current into the Pacific (pg 369 para 2) but into the Atlantic (pg 421 para 4) There are other misconceptions in the book, such as the characters yelling at one another because they are standing near a noisy ventilation fan while endeavoring to be stealthy. Loud noises do not necessarily mask other sounds near them, loud noises make it hard to hear when the listener is close to them. Try standing near your running garbage grinder and speaking to someone further away; they can hear you, you can't hear them. Althgether a hard book to read, confusing to say the least. Not up to the standards of some of his earlier books. 
 I was surprised that the authors used such a significant amount of material from Atul Nerkar.  He has been widely discredited given his unorthodox teachings at Columbia, and few if any of his peers have bought into his lines of reasoning.  While some of the material in the book was thoughtfully presented, one must question the author's judgment in drawing upon sources such as Nerkar 
 Not a bad book, just a little outdated from some of the information and training techniques the trainers use at my athletic club. Doesn't show enough stomach work in my estimation or work with common weight machines 
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant 
 this book seems to target children under 12 years of age.  It has very few pointers for adolescents. this book tends to be aimed at the education profession rather than parents
