 I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.    The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.  This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.  
 I agree with all the negative reviews on this list about this disc and Lang Lang in general.  I was deeply disappointed with his performances of the Tchaikovsky/Mendelssohn and Rachmaninov concertos.  Then, my friend asked me to listen to his Islamey, exclaiming that it was one of the most remarkable performances he'd ever heard.  I remember clearly thinking how boring it was and had to have my friend listen to the incredible performance by Ogdon and, even more brazen account (remember this piece ismeant to be a showpiece, and not the pseudo-intellectual piece Lang Lang thinks it is) by Barere.  Although I'm no fan of Islamey, I find it very easy to discern the difference between mediocrity (Lang Lang) and brilliance.  I got a chance to listen to some of this disc couple of months ago, and boy, he continues to disappoint.  Regarding all those who say he's the next Horowitz or Richter blah blah, I suspect that these people don't know history.  Another fundamental mistake they make is that they form conclusions without comparing to other performances.  Just compare his interpretations of the abegg variations and the Wanderer fantasy to those by Kissin or Richter.  You'll quickly notice how pedantic and uninspiring Lang Lang's accounts are.  Boring as I don't know what!  Likewise, try comparing his Tchaikovsky's 1st or Rach 2nd to those by Horowitz, Argerich, and Freire, and Richter, Kissin, Cliburn, Ashkenazy, Jando and countless others.  Lang Lang sounds absolutely amateurish in comparison.  Memory can be very fleeting and the only reliable thing is to compare side by side.  His mediocrity just jumps out and grabs you.  I'm willing to admit that my main objections to Lang Lang's musicality is subjective in nature.  Afterall, taste is taste.  While I find Lang Lang's tone terribly uneven and dull, with his interpretations without life, with his general stance of "let's not mess things up here" attitude, others may indeed find him exciting.  However, I will not concede that his technique is somehow "one of the greatest."  To this day, I cannot figure out how one can consider his technique to be great.  Just sit in a dark room, close your eyes and dissect his articulation, finger work, phrasing, octaves, and you'll notice that no way in hell does his technique measure up to those by Michelangeli, Hamelin, Barere, Berman, and Horowitz, or even to those by Leslie Howard, Kissin, Zayas, Argerich, Gould, Gavrilov, Cziffra, Kocsis, and Pollini.  To me Lang Lang's technique is dead average, nothing special, and for those who think his technique is one of the greatest in history or at least one of the greatest around, perhaps more listening and studying is required.  Sure, Clint Eastwood is a solid film maker, but to say to me that he is in the league with Orson Welles, Jean Renoir, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock would lead me believe that more film study of the classics is in order.  In conclusion, Lang Lang (and this disc set) is a joke.  People tend to think that because an artist is heavily promoted by a large record company like DG, then he must be good.  This effect can be very powerful and, now in this era, often very wrong.  If classical music continues down this path of promoting dead average pianists, then we are all going to suffer 
 Thumbed through this book in the store... Loved the idea, and the  selection of topics - architecture, natural phenomena, etc. - really wanted  to buy it. Ran across some typos... some missing information... and  ultimately just plain bogus "mathematics": sin^2 + cos^2 =1.  Well, sin and cos of what? As written, it's nonsense... there's nonsense  all around us too, but I wouldn't want to read a book about it. Wondered  why the publisher did not employ an editor... put it back on the shelf 
 I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected. Pay a little more and buy an IPOD.  It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well. 
 the show lost it's zip by season 7. the chemistry wasn't the same. the scripts had gotten watered down&you could sense a show just going through the motions on quite a few of these episodes.the show had it's last real peak during Season 4.i still enjoy watching the show though 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I could attack this book for its lack of political merit, but that would just come off as a rant. What rather incites this negative review is that the book is just so poorly written. The text is laced with opinion statements masked as fact (for example, the semantic debate over what constitutes a "conservative;" this argument, which is one of the cover issues of the book, is bizarre on its own because it takes the late-18th century definition of liberal and stacks it up against the 20th century definition of conservative, but again, neither here nor there).  Every sentence is very simple, there are no words that are too big, so as not to confuse every South Park conservative who gets lost between the Dan Browns, the Steve Kings, and the 2-for-$11 DVD sections at the bookstores. The book is brimming with needless erreta and digressions, distractions, not to mention a fair number of grammatical errors, ironic (or appropo?) given the book's harsh condemnation of the American intellectual; in a book where every professor is a communist and every college graduate is a tree-hugger, it's not terribly surprising to find so much passive voice, subject-object confusion, confused pronouns, and uncited "data."  Certainly a fine bookshelf filler for every budding, young neoconservative. But if you're interested in buying a book that you'll be able to get all the way through without chuckling to yourself and muttering, "and this is presented as a HISTORY book?" you may wish to look elsewhere 
 I quote from GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL, p. 215: "...after spending a half hour with that book, GODS' MAN. I called [a nun, six years my senior, who has been my spiritual director for more than twenty-five years] sobbing with a complex of emotions, including hatred for the author, disgust at the book, rage at its destructiveness, sorrow for all the other young boys and girls who had been the book's victims, and a feeling of deep contamination that I had received just from looking at it. After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years." Undoubtedly, Dr. Peck's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of Peck's patients. But now you are forewarned 
 I bought this book hoping this book would provide me `do and don't list' on technical writing, but it did not deliver its' promise, confidently exhibited on the book's title..."How to Write About Technical Subjects and Products So Anyone Can Understand." The contents in the book is good, however, they broadly discuss the `technical writing' profession, not 'how to write....' I suggest author to change the title of the book so it does not mislead readers 
 I purchased this book hoping that it would help me loosen up my watercolor painting.  I was disappointed enough to return it, something I rarely do.  Clearly, this author has found an enthusiastic audience to which to sell these books and her paintings, but I suspect they are something of a fringe group.  That's fine, but I recommend you look over this book thoroughly before committing to purchasing it.  There is basically no instruction that will teach you to do a watercolor painting in anything but vague, fuzzy, garishly colored (she really, really likes bright pink) paintings that call to my mind the tie-died T-shirts of the 60's.  I was also put off by the self-portrayal of the author as a kind of artistico-spiritual guru.  In her experience, she says, all watercolor students fall into one of two categories:  those who never finish a picture because they are too hung up on doing things just so, and those who would like to play but don't know how--left brain types and right brain types.  She assures us she has had an epiphany and is now beyond such limitations.  If you buy her books, she'll share her higher wisdom.  Well,  good for her, she's got her audience.  There are Taoist quotes at the beginning of the chapters, but if you want to explore that philosophy, you'd be better off with a source that truly addresses it.  If you want to learm how to do watercolors, this is not the place to do it 
 This is a badly written, repetitive and self-serving account, largely, of the foolishness of "portflio insurance." That things which are "just like" something else may not be so in reality, and that  magic fixes in the market (which after all fly in the face of the  rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built  into the view of the market being relied on) I guess needs to be pointed  out regularly, since hope of quick, uninformed, and painless fixes seem to  reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed  on. Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre  episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such "scams" are  still prevalent. However, He does this in a horribly repetitive and  self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued 
   I got this book from the library, after having taken out, and IMMENSELY enjoyed other books with similar themes by Indian, and/or Indian-American authors, like Kavita Daswani, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Amulya Malladi.      I might have enjoyed this book, and I could have thought it was a good book, if only the author, and the publishers had considered the print and style when printing the books.      What I am referring to, is that in this book, EVERY SINGLE new paragraph is preceded by a long hyphen (dash) which was EXTREMELY distracting, and made it VERY difficult for me to get through what may or may not have been a very good book.      The hyphen (dash) that I am speaking of is this, for example:      - She said, "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda". Then she went out to blah blah blah.      - He said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then he went out to blah blah blah.       - They said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then they went out to blah blah blah.         Because of this distracting form of typing, I was barely able to get past the first dozen or so pages.       It sounded like a very interesting book, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the constant hyphens. I'm sure its probably even harder for those with dyslexia, and other reading impairments as well as poor eyesight.      Maybe in the future, the author and publisher could think of this and maybe print the books just like other normal, regular books.    Then maybe I'd try reading it again. 
 I usually like this genre, but I am giving up on this book after 40 pages. I thought it would be similar to The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, but it's not nearly as engaging. It was as if I kept waiting for the story to get started. I even flipped ahead from time to time to see if it got better. It didn't appear to.  I also got tired of the bad language 
 (With the possible exception of Klemperer's Fidelio.)  I am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message. As Mr Clinton's campaign team would say, "It's the singing, stupid". Do *not* be mislead by the starry names, this thing barks and yowls like New Year's Eve in the cats-and-dogs home.  Do not pass Go, do not waste $35, go directly to Josef Krips on Decca Legends for three discs of perfect joy 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 The product description for Killers' 'Hot Fuss' describes it as 'eleven nuggets of reel-you-in storytelling genius'. Come on. With the exception of 'Somebody Told Me', the lead singer runs the gamut of emotions from A to B (to paraphrase Dorothy Parker). 'Mr. Brightside' features all of 3 or 4 notes total and banal lyrics that are repeated, in full twice. No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses. 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English 
 The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...  No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.  Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.  So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again 
 i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.    please, look at it! it's awful!    drew barrymore, in her sad "poison ivy" stage, is a wretched performer.  there are pothole plothole's all over the place.  and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore.  were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?  oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?  there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.  hey! now it sounds kind of good again 
 This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs.  It does not give practical advice on how to read auras 
 I was reviewing many books online for purchase in terms of a refresher before I entered my college algebra class. After following many links and reading through many reviews I landed upon this one. After reading the reviews I was certain this was the book for me. But the title is slightly misleading, somewhat, as it had me believing it was a book purely based on a "student" mind and apptitude.  But after recieving the book and reading through it, to my surprise I find that it is nothing more than an answer sheet to a book with a similar title, and written by the same authors. Read these reviewers below me more carefully and they will certainly also have you believing the book reviewed is the one in which your about to buy. But that could not be farther from the truth.   Just take a look at the provided excerpt and you will see what I mean. Very disappointed to have found this after the fact. I scanned merely through the TOC. This was mostly my own fault but I was certainly lead towards this belief. Ah well. Hope noone shares my fate 
 The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star  Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for  the alien fighters in this movie.. 
 For the love of God do not buy this book, if you do, trust me you will be sorry. You could find the exact same documents that are in this book on the internet. It just looks like a series of documents taken by a teenager from the internet and incorporated into a book.Dont waste your mone 
 Well, I just received Gavin Lambert's book on Natalie Wood, and after trudging through this monotonous, overblown biography, the conclusion is as follows: it's boring as hell!  (I can't say I haven't been warned). This is the "wonderful" biography of Natalie that is supposed to set the record straight?  It boasts 78 photos, but instead of being included in a glossy pictures section, they are widespread on various pages in the book so that they appear grainy.  It seems to me that it was written as a rebuttal, and to paint Lana Wood as a greedy, vicious person (she was obviously not interviewed), and to make childish slaps at her, when she was not given the opportunity to tell her side of it.   Robert Wagner seems threatened by anyone who knew Natalie before he, Lambert and Mart Crowley did - dismissing all of the people Natalie befriended before who offered their insights in "Natasha: The Biography Of Natalie Wood" as vultures who barely made her aquaintance and who are weaving fantasies about her.  Basically, Wagner is uncomfortable with the aspects of Natalie's life that he was not involved in.  It doesn't really attempt to get behind Natalie's persona any, like "Natasha" did, and of course, it doesn't acknowledge Natalie's love for Jimmy Williams, her first boyfriend, the rape by a famous actor, or what happened on the night of her death, hastily tying up loose ends and making her death sound so simple.  Lambert wrote this book for Wagner, there's no question, and Natasha and Courtney are hardly mentioned at all.  Did Lambert actually do any in-depth research?  As well, there are allegations that Nick Gurdin may not have been Natalie's or Lana's father, and then there's Natasha Lofft, who has not proven with DNA that she is actually Natalie's half sister, but Wagner and the girls have no problem believing that she is, but they dismiss Suzanne Finstad's book as speculation and trash? I'll believe this claimant's story when I see proof! At least Finstad was able to remain somewhat objective and unbiased, since she did not know Natalie (and she did try to get Wagner's input, but he refused) which is obviously not the case with this pathetic attempt at a so-called "definitive" biography. Much of the book appears to be written quickly, but at least it does name the film Natalie turned down, which was reputed to have the actor who raped her in the cast.  And of course, it has to dispel all the allegations of Wagner's sexual orientation, and what played the role in the demise of his first marriage to Natalie.  As much of a disappointment as this book is, I'm glad I purchased it so I can compare it to "Natasha" and Lana's book to try to decipher what is closer to the truth.  At least I didn't have to spend too much money on it!  Whatever the truth, I hope that Natalie is at peace. 
 Summary: Disjoint and Superficial.  The author had access to an outstanding group of individuals and in many cases squandered the opportunity with superficial questions.  Instead of getting key insights, I felt like I was getting trivia.  The interviews read more like something from People magazine (or maybe a sidebar in a Keyboard/Music magazine) than a highly rated book.  Where is the depth that Kettlewell should be able to provide?  I found it impossible to get through section two.  The intent may have been to be exhaustive in its list of pioneers, but instead I found it exhausting - dry, dull, superficial and disjoint.  In addition the book is poorly edited, as if rushed to publication 
 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 Never in my life have I been so outraged by what I have read as by the drivel spouted by Dr. West in this book (in his Translator's Note), and by the use of `unponderingly' and "the Thinkery" (among other things) in his translation of The Clouds. I also read his translation of Plato's Apology of Socrates, and found it grossly inferior to Jowett.  Four Texts on Socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly: it should be hurled with great force. (Apologies to Dorothy Parker.)  Not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept, almost everything that he writes in his Translator's Note is wrong.  The Clouds is a play, not a scientific or mathematical treatise. As such, it has characters and dialogue. A `modern' translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a `modern' audience. If a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary, one does not make him spout drivel such as 'unponderingly'; one gives him a `shtick', which is a theatrical term. It's more or less a running gag associated with a particular character. You create, through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together, a characterization. He could be made to speak like a parody of William F. Buckley or the Star Wars character Yoda. As it stands, West's text cannot be presented as a play.  It is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as 'unponderingly'; indeed, it is inexcusable. It conveys neither humor nor cleverness. It comes off simply as stupid. The translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters, which Dr. West obviously does not. To state it bluntly: The translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization, and who are creative. Dr. West doesn't have a creative bone in his body.  In regard to his translation of Plato's The Apology of Socrates, the translation by Dr. West is both original and good, but the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good. After all, when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as Benjamin Jowett to follow, the temptation to do something entirely different is strong. But it must be resisted. If Dr. West had merely lightly revised Jowett's great work, he would have made a contribution to learning. Alas, he did neither.   The version by Jowett is clearly superior. Here is a short excerpt:  "And I must beg of you to grant me a favor: If I defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which I have been in the habit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country: Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly."  Compare West's inept version:  "...I do very much beg and beseech this of you: if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches I am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money-tables, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere, do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this. For this is how it is: now is the first time I have come before a law court, at the age of seventy; hence I am simply foreign to the manner of speech here. So just as, if I really did happen to be a foreigner, you would surely sympathize with me if I spoke in the dialect and way in which I was raised, so also I do beg of you now (and it is just, at least, as it seems to me): leave aside the manner of my speech--for perhaps it may be worse, but perhaps better--and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this: whether the things I say are just or not. For this is the virtue of a judge, while that of an orator is to speak the truth."  "Speaking...with the same speeches I am accustomed to speak"? How utterly inept and repetitive! Didn't he even proof-read? One doesn't speak with 'speeches', one speaks with words!  It is obvious that Dr. West never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness, which is surprising, because this work is supposed to be a speech. Dr. West's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud, whereas Jowett's is. In West's translation, Socrates is a clumsy, repetitive, and inept speaker. Needlessly so. If you want to read a good translation, see Jowett's 3rd edition (1892).  Why does Dr. West believe himself qualified to make translations? Nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so. This is not the work of a scholar, but that of a bungling hack. These translations are travesties. How does work this nauseatingly bad get published?  NOT RECOMMENDE 
 This is a film about two soldiers captured during the Chechen war.  Normally the Chechen rebels don't take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the Russians.

The soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel's son.  Ivan's mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt.  Eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier.  Ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape 
 As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me 
 This novel by A.E.W. Mason is an epic tale about a young soldier named Harry Feversham. After receiving three white feathers of cowardness from his fellow soldiers, and one from Ethne, Harry sets out to redeem himself. The novel is slow to start, and stays dull throughout his ventures. For being a love story during a time of war, the book is lacking romance and battle. There are so many characters in the book that none of them ever seem to be fully developed; not even Harry. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering who three quarters of the characters were and what their significant role was in the novel. I have read the book twice and I still have no clue why Harry was retrieving the letters from the wall and what their importance was to the story. If you chose this book to read at night to put you to sleep, or really like patriotic British war stories, then by all means, this may be the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the book was extremely hard to follow, the characters had little depth, and there was no action at all (this is supposed to be a story about a soldier). The novel was extremely predictable, and like most love stories, everything ends happily ever after. After Harry's heroic acts in the desert the three soldiers take their feathers back and this also wins Ethne's heart.   
 Please note that I write this review from the perspective of someone who won't be retiring for at least two more decades.  I think by the time I retire, the state of the world will be quite different.  Hopefully al Queda or the greedy pigs on Wall Street haven't destroyed our beautiful country by then...  I got this book in e-book format as part of my Quick WillMaker Plus 2005 software package.  It only has some mostly general information, and I don't think it's worth the full price of the printed version.  The author promotes the idea that you don't need a lot of money to retire; all you need is a loving family.  Sure, and we can just count on social security (which is to be privatized and feeding the greedy Wall Street pigs) and our kids.  This guy must be living in some utopian pipe dream.  If you want a feel-happy book, this may be for you.  Otherwise, get a book that offers practical advice on how to save and what government benefits programs are (still) available 
 In my opinion this was not a good book. If it hadn't been such a short read I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it. Maybe the movie is better 
 Unfortunately, I read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed.  Hmph.  If this is what people think a great recording is, then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse.  A few people did mention that the voices might not be the best, but seem to think that this is a small matter.  Guess what -- the two lead singers ARE pretty darn bad, and to me it's a big deal.  They are marginal singers, at best. I can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore, and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns.   It was actually, quite literally, painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by Riding and Hayden.  Every time that we want a musical delivery, we're cheated of the pay-off.  Rodgers and Hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder, and this particular work deserves passion, feeling and true musical prowess from the performers.  This recording sorely lacks these qualities.  The only redeeming qualities - the singing of Clive Rowe as Enoch Snow and nice conducting in the Prologue.  Otherwise, save your money and - no, don't save your money - buy another recording like the old one with Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae and listen to some good voices.  Really.  Trust me.  I have a fine set of musical ears and I know voices 
 These are fine, if they weren't supposed to have blueberries. There are essentially none. Most pouches of the 24 don't even contain a piece of blueberry, when you do find one it's a very nice taste with the peanut, but sadly, that's very rare.  Avoid this variety 
 The mere act of arguing that comic art qualifies as "fine art" somehow legitimizes such nonproductive and ultimately meaningless distinctions. Yet this catalogue's obvious purpose is to somehow elevate, by force of such argument, the reputations of comic strip and comic book artists. As the early twentieth century cultural critic, Gilbert Seldes, stated in his review of George Herriman's Krazy Kat:  	Krazy Kat, the daily comic strip of George Herriman is, 	to me, the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory 	work of art produced in America today.  With those who 	hold that a comic strip cannot be a work of art, I shall 	not traffic.   Not only is it unlikely that this book of self-promoting essays, largely written by comic artists, will advance the position of comic art within the insular and rarified world of contemporary art criticism, the book does not even go far enough to promote the appreciation of the genre among those readers/viewers with a genuine interest in the art form.   The presentation of comic strip art is certainly worthy of attention, despite the glaring exclusion of any significant discussion of the two giants of adventure strip art, Alex Raymond and Hal Foster. But the quality of the strip art which is included speaks so loudly that the written commentary can be largely ignored in evaluating the artistic merits.  Ironically, the authors' verbose analyses of modern comic book art will probably fall on more sympathetic ears, despite the fact that  most of the artists chosen as representative of American comic book art would not even be considered by most comic book aficionados as top contenders for inclusion in a comic art exhibition.  But, then again, that is probably why these "graphic novel" and underground comic book artists were selected -- they produce the type of art that is most likely to appeal to the gimmick sensibility of contemporary art critics.  When judged by more traditional (some would say old-fashion) standards of artistic excellence, such as quality of draftsmanship and composition, it is hard to see how most of these artists have produced even good art, let alone "fine art."  But, perhaps like the child who could not see the emperor's new clothes, some viewers just are not sophisticated enough to fully understand or appreciate fine contemporary comic book art.  If you fall into this category, then this is the perfect book for you.  CRAIG W.  ENGLUND 
 I didn't like this album.  All I heard from my friends for WEEKS was "Buy this album!"  I bought it, and I only liked one song (Pins and Needles). Want good emo? Check out Armor For Sleep or Senses Fail 
 Nothing wrong with this version of Powers' stories, but I prefer the original, unabridged "Prince of Darkness and Other Stories" which is available in Doubleday paperback, first published back when Powers was hailed as "a compelling young talent in American fiction, perhaps the most exciting short-story writer to emerge since Eudora Welty."  -- Philadelphia Inquirer.    The Doubleday Image Books imprint set about "making the world's finest Catholic literature avilable to all..."  True, Mr. Powers' work is formed by his Catholicism, but in subject matter, he writes about baseball and jazz, old people and boys, boxers and more.  He has, The New Yorker once observed,"few rivals at creating characters with more than superficial reality. 
 As Strunk and White advise in the classic guide to writing, _The Elements of Style_, "Do not overstate. When you overstate, readers will be instantly on guard, and everything that has preceded your overstatement as well as everything that follows it will be suspect in their minds because they have lost confidence in your judgment or your poise."  I wanted to like this book, because I find Genghis Khan and his empire to be fascinating, and yet the author so completely overstates the significance of the Mongols that he loses all credibility, and pollutes an otherwise highly readable and interesting set of facts with so much fiction that it is often difficult to distinguish the two. For example, he claims in the introduction that the Mongols had founded the first unified nations of Korea and China, apparently ignorant of the fact that Korea had been unified since AD 668, and that China was first unified by the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. Similarly, he states on p. 237 that "[the Renaissance] was not the ancient world of Greece and Rome being reborn: It was the Mongol Empire, picked up, transferred, and adapted by the Europeans to their own needs and culture." Although the evidence for Greek and Roman influence on the Renaissance is overwhelming, the evidence for Mongol influence is flimsy at best. The more outsized the claim, the less evidence the author seems to provide.   Furthermore, he tries to give the Mongols credit for inspiring Renaissance art, which he calls a hybrid of Eastern and Western styles; he gives the Mongols credit for disseminating Arabic and Indian mathematics (the Arabs themselves had disseminated Indian mathematics throughout the civilized world, long before the Mongols); he gives the Mongols credit for introducing the compass to the West (the compass was mentioned in Alexander Neckham's De Naturis Rerum, written in 1190, before Genghis Khan had even ventured out of Mongolia); and he gives the Mongols credit for inventing the Silk Road, which had already existed for thousands of years.   What the book desperately needs are a fact-checker and responsible editor to curb the author's literary excesses. The author clearly sympathizes with the Mongols and wants to promote their case as responsible bearers of civilization. His biases are so blinding, that he frequently makes irrelevant comparisons to the worst excesses of the Catholic Inquisition to try to justify the mass slaughter of the Mongols, and even tries to deny the scale of Mongol genocides altogether, lamely asserting (p. 118), "It would be physically difficult to slaughter that many cows or pigs, which wait passively for their turn. Overall, those who were supposedly slaughtered outnumber the Mongols by ratios of up to fifty to one. The people could have merely run away, and the Mongols would not have been able to stop them." The gigantic flaw in logic is that the Mongols never faced odds of 50-to-1 at any one moment, but rather wiped out city after city in a process that took many years. His claim the the people could "have merely run away" is laughable, given his constant reminders that the Mongol cavalry were the fastest and most efficient army of the day. He could just as easily have applied the same ludicrous argument to any other historical genocide in order to deny their scale and seriousness.  I still like the subject of Genghis Khan, and Weatherford has whetted my appetite: I may eventually pick up one of the other, more serious and scholarly books on the topic. However, I will never again make the mistake of reading anything written by Mr. Weatherford. 
 This book is fun to read, yes, no question about that, the problem are the facts inside.  In the first pages I found the first error. I continued, but without knowing if what I was reading was true. For example, Mr. Comfort, in page 12, states: "It was another 2000 years later (at a time when science believed that the earth was flat) that the scriptures inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world." Well, the problem is that, first, Columbus wasn't inspired by scriptures and, second, in those times people didn't believe that the earth was flat.   I am a Christian, and I'm very disappointed. Mr. Comfort's efforts to find evidence of modern science, modern hygiene and even dinosaurs in the Bible are simply unbelievable, and many times feels forced. He even quotes famous people on the Bible, I mean, if Napoleon said anything good about the Bible, that is a proof of is supernatural origin? He founds what his eyes want to find, he understands what he wants to understand... The worst is that he sees things that are not there and compares it to data that is wrong... The result is a fun but messy book. 
 would you buy a used contra from this man?  Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.  Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.  Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.  GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.  Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.  For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.  Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way. 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, talented musicians. I think they're trying too hard to sound "classic-rock". Every song on this album sounds exactly the same. You heard one, you heard them all. I got rid of it the next day 
 This is a truly unfunny followup to the classic Arthur.  Arthur and Linda are married, unfortunately not happily married.  They want to adopt a baby but first Arthur must sober up.  Even a visit by Hobson's ghost (Gielguld) cannot bring life into this uninspired sequel.  The original writer and director Steve Gordon died shortly after the original was released and it is obvious that it is missing his touch.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Watch the original 
 If you are a golfer, ignore this. It's probably a good read for ageing hippies into 60s/70s mysticism. Golf provides a backdrop but is not the main thesis. If you are looking for any insight into golf psychology look elsewhere 'cos it aint here 
 Similar to the other reviewer, my seams ripped the first time i used it.  I don't like top loading as well, but it seems pretty common.  Would avoid and spend an extra $20 and get something else.  It does fit into carry on regulations, however. 
  One of those books that sounds like it's going to teach you something, so you buy it. And then it beats one little nugget to death for many pages with lots of white space. Save your money 
 The story-line is OK, even though some unlikely coincidences occur.  BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others).  It was like slogging through quicksand to read it.  The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors.  A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's.  Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published 
 It appears that the thesis of this book is that logical organization and structure in the laws of physics only goes so far down, that you reach a certain level where the nature of reality is intrinsically opaque and that even in principle there can be no further explanations, that things just are the way they are.  Further, at this level of opacity, the "givens" are very messy and arbitrary: there is no elegance, simplicity, and beauty, the heretofore goals of scientific theories. Instead, at bottom the universe we live in is a Rube Goldberg concoction of surpassing inelegance.  At this point, the author, Leonard Susskind, says there are two possibilities:  1. There is only one universe, the one we live in. In that case, these messy, seemingly arbitrary laws and constants of the universe must be deliberately designed to allow the development of intelligent creatures like us human beings. This follows the so-called "strong" anthropic principle: our very existence proves there is an Intelligence Designer behind all of existence.  2. There are unending possibilities in the laws and constants of nature and our universe is just one possibility. There is a "megaverse" that continuously spawns "pocket universes," each of which has a random set of laws and constants, and our universe is just one of these countless numbers.   How can we make a purely scientific decision between these two views? Until recently, a lot of physicists hoped that String Theory would be found to support the first scenario: there would be a single solution to the equations that would produce the particular laws and constants we find in our universe. This seemingly arbitrary and messy collection of too many constants and laws would actually flow from a tiny set of first principles that would appear to be inevitable. This would also get around the "need" for an Intelligent Designer. The universe would be the way it is because it has to be that way.  But, alas, the most recent developments of String Theory seem to be pushing in the opposite direction: String Theory seems to allow for an unimaginably large set of possible sets of laws and constants: ten to the five-hundredth power in fact! Among all those possibilities, one or more like our own universe would arise purely by chance, and once again there wouldn't be anything mysterious or supernatural about our existence.  Thus, Susskind triumphantly disposes of the need of a supernatural basis for existence no matter what, and if this book has any focus at all this conclusion seems to be it.  The attitude that is convinced by this kind of reasoning is called scientific materialism. It is commonly used in popular science books by atheistic authors. Now there is nothing wrong with trying to explain phenomena "all the way down," without bringing supernatural causes and "miracles" into the picture. That's what the business of science is, and we should always be suspect when the miraculous is used to fill in "gaps" that science is unable (at the moment) to fill (most often these reputed gaps are merely wishful thinking on the part of religious fundamentalists anyhow, especially when it comes to "disbelief" in evolution). But to conclude that there is no transcendent ground to existence just because we have scientific explanations for something "all the way down" is overstepping the bounds of science proper into scientific materialism, and that is the fatal flaw of this book and is a major reason for me downgrading it to two stars.  Just because a God may not be self-consciously involved in the selection of the most fundamental laws of nature in our pocket universe doesn't mean that it doesn't take the infinite depths of a God behind everything to provide "room" in the potentialities of existence for life as we know it to arise. The very fact that it is possible for something like the human mind to arise from the apparently "dead" material of existence speaks to a transcendent nature that is behind it all.  This is the point that everyone seems to miss who preaches like Susskind that because at bottom it is only a matter of chance that our universe has the laws that it has, there is no "need" for God. The very fact that human experience is possible, even with our laws at bottom the result of sheer chance among 10**500 other possibilities, this very fact requires there to be an infinite Presence that some like to call God. It is God's bottomless nature that allows such highly improbable universes as ours to come into existence in the first place. God doesn't need to bring any universes into existence consciously; he does it by his very nature, and most of them pop in an out of existence without God even being consciously aware of them: it's just something God does without having to think about it. But without this infinite nature, none of us would ever appear in any highly improbable, anthropic universe, because the potential would not be there.   Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce bacteria. Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce 10**500 universes for every one like ours. But God is a prerequisite for universes like ours even to appear. The miracle is that there is "room" for a universe like ours to exist. God doesn't need to concern himself with the overwhelming preponderance of abortive pocket universes that pop in and out of existence. The spark of his consciousness needs only to spring alive when a universe like ours happens along by sheer chance. Then he can take an interest and start persuading consciousness when it begins to arise to flow in certain directions, towards his own unlimited possibilities in depth and beauty. God then acts like a lure, drawing consciousness into his own explosive depths, and who knows how far evolution can then proceed, once the conscious God takes hold of it.  In presenting this "theistic" view of reality, I'm really doing no more than the same sort of thing that Susskind is doing, and that's the flaw of this book. I'm not presenting science, but Susskind is using the name of science to present an atheistic view contrary to theistic views that irritate him. All I'm saying is that his atheistic views are easily countered by alternative theistic views. In either case, those views are only going to be persuasive to those with corresponding spiritual experiences of the world. As for the science that Susskind does describe in his book, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, it has been far better explained by other authors such as Brian Greene. I was frankly bored silly by the last half of Susskind's book, whereas Brian Greene is fascinating throughout. 
 i remember reading this book in high school and being TERRIFIED- basically, unless you have a 4.0 and an SAT score above 1430, you have practically no shot at admission. The author completely disregards the importance of extracurricular/personal qualities, saying that unless you're a perfect student they don't really matter, and that so long as you are, it doesnt really matter what you spend your free time doing or what the quality of your essay is.  Ok, as a Yale undergrad, I speak from experience- YES, you do need to have excellent grades and scores, but they aren't everything. I had a 3.5 GPA, and granted my SAT score was 1560, but I know people with perfect scores and 4.5 GPAs who were rejected simply BECAUSE they lacked that spark that all successful upper ivy candidates have. So don't kill yourself if you're not perfect, and don't take advice from this kind of tripe- if you are in some way unique or special, they WILL consider you for admission. Why do you think so many "perfect" students get turned down year after year? Precisely BECAUSE they do not come across as interesting candidates. 
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 AMAZON'S ALBUM DESCRIPTION UP THERE IS WRONG, THIS ISN'T THE ALBUM WITH 'THE RUNNER' OR ANY OF THE 19 TRACKS THE REVIEW SAYS... THAT SONG YOU CAN'T GET HERE 
 I bought this book based on glowing reviews by a majority of readers; Ann Rule was touted as an outstanding writer.  I found this book to be about as gripping as a newspaper article.  Dull and  boring.  Sorry, Ann Rule fans.  Now I am trying another of her books "Every Breath You Take, and it is starting off even worse.  I hope it gets better or my review on that one will be another grudging one star. 
 The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras 
 ...and use the techniques in this book on the book itself.  Sadly, a book with so much promise falls victim to its own PR machine all too often.  Face it, if you're going to use critical thinking, use it consistently.  If you use it against what you don't like, but cast a blind eye on things you are passionate about, how critical is that, really 
 I've learned so much from this book, it's unbelievable.  I had no idea what was needed to get published, and was just blithely going along writing because I like to.    I had no great thoughts of going any further with it, but a week ago at a Writer's Conference I pitched my idea to an agent, just because she was there.  She asked for a proposal and samples!!  I had no idea how to go about a proposal, but I did have this little yellow book (Author 101 - Bestselling Book Proposals) I had bought several months ago at the suggestion of a fellow member of a Writer's Group.  It was still sitting where I put it that night so long ago - lucky I even found it, as disorganized as I am.)  Since our Writing group wasn't to meet for another two weeks, I couldn't wait to ask for help, so drug out the book ... what a total joy to find this little thing, filled chock-ful of ideas, suggestions and samples.  I'm about half-way through with the proposal (book's already written ... as well as two sequels) and will present it to my group for critiques.  I'm in love with this book!  Thank you so much, Rick and Robyn!  (I gave this book 5 stars, but when it showed up in my preview it showed as only 1)  
 If you're looking for a thoughtful critique of the media, look elsewhere.  This book contains more name-calling within its pages than a junior high school does within its doors. The author indiscriminately hurls the epithet "right-wing" to describe just about everyone who isn't a Democrat.  Did Ted Kennedy ghostwrite this?   Bill O'Reilly is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a grandstanding populist.  John Stossel is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a libertarian.  Brock can't even give them the dignity of using an insulting term that actually describes who they are.  The left simply loses credibility and strips "right wing" of any discerable meaning when they brand everyone from George W. Bush (the biggest spender since LBJ) to the Cato Institute to Adolf Hitler as being "right wing."  Maybe most people in politics don't think about the meaning of words, only what effect they have, but readers of a long book deserve to have their intelligence respected.  Brock doesn't.  The errant insults, hyperbolic generalizations, and misrepresentations go on and on in this book.  At least Ann Coulter's off the wall attack books are entertaining.  Brock's sense of humor is apparently still under development, if he has one at all.  Yes, the book has some information in it that some people may find useful.  But the sneering writing style, for me at least, totally overwhelms and negates any value I may have otherwise derived from this hatchet job of a book.  So I'm giving it only 1 star 
 Thank God I didn't have to pay for this book. It's overloaded with information that I didn't find helpful in actually learning to speak Spanish. Even a retired person, such as myself, began to grow impatient with the abundance of information that was not directly related to speaking Spanish. If you really want to get to the "meat" of Spanish vocabulary and grammar, you would do much better by purchasing "Spanish Grammar for Indepedent Learners." It is expensive but I think it's much better than Spanish for Dummies.  But even with Spanish Grammar for Indenpendent Learners, you will still need private lessons or a good Spanish course. If you like learning on your own, Pimsleur is excellent. It's my favorite because the Spanish is very formal, you'd have to go to Spain if you wanted to learn Spanish more formal. If you don't like the formal Spanish and just want to learn Spanish for communicating with employees, customers, co-workers, or for dating, then you may prefer Learning Spanish Like Crazy. 
 I bought this charger 11 months ago.  It came with 4 Kodak 1850 mA NiMH batteries.  After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should.  If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do >60).  If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week.  The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries.  But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly.  This was after very light use.  I only charge AAA batteries once a month.  The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago.  I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 This movie is rated PG; yet I was not able to show this movie to my kids. I know that the world is full of aggression, however how can I sit with my family and watch a movie with so much violence between kids. Some will tell me that it is good to expose children to such violence and possibly reality of life and the human beings among each other. I totally disagree. This movie should be rated R and not PG 2 stars, only because of the great acting; the story is basic, about  a father feeling awful for leaving his best buddy behind during the Vietnam War while his kids are fighting other children over a tree hut. I know I am probably going to bombarded with bad feedbacks however this is my honest opinion about this movie. 
 This book is basically a pamphlet for the Buteyko method and those that teach it.  It briefly describes the Buteyko theory behind asthma,  a bunch of testimonials, a history of Dr. Buteyko and the practice of his technique, and the goals of the technique.  This information is freely available in equal or greater depth on the internet.  I don't find testimonials to be terribly convincing.  This book does not teach one how to do the Buteyko technique, claiming that it must be done under the close supervision of a properly trained person.  As such, this book is worthless 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 Man this game sucks.  I LOVE SNL, but the questions here are SO trivial.  I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it.  It all went downhill from there.  I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly.  The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective.  I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind).  He couldn't read the questions on the tv.  I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated.  Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all!  As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.  One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri.  Whatever.  Game sucks.  Costs too much.  Stay away 
 I did not find solace in this book - no tenderness or, in my opinion,understanding of how hurtful the loss of a pet is.  I do not recommend this book 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 This book is really nothing more than a collection of generalized knowledge, and some good pictures.  I don't need someone to tell me in a book that I need an engine, transmission, etc to build an old school bobber. "How to" suggests exactly that - you are going to tell me how things get done, and provide me with some good instructions, tips, tricks, and pictures to go along with it.  If you want a book that gets down to the nuts and bolts of the building process, buy something from a different author because this book won't tell you how to build the bobber you want 
 Im really astounded by how well this movie has been rated. I love Depp and I thought it was terrible. I think he wanted to do something a bit different and dark but this movie is just sort of pointless. It's about the English restoration and the rebirth of the theatre during a time when sex and murder and general taboo subjects were unacceptable but rampant. It takes the nature of the period to the extreme and was overall terrible. It acted like it was very profound but conveyed very little. It had potential to be an incredible movie but if you're looking for a Depp fix- just pick up something else. 
 There was no insight into this book. All they did was look at the poems already written, and take out the last words 
 This cd sucks. I listened to it a couple of times trying to convince myself that it was good, but its just so weak. Mannie is a nasty producer but this album was a dissappointment.  Dont buy this, buy old B.G. Wayne, and Hot Boy$ if you dont already have it 
 Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral "I nearly got crushed in the crowd", and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies " Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy". This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers 
 I can't tell you what you might want to buy, but it shouldn't be this unit. I've been unable to depend on it since the day I got it. I'm quite technical, having managed tech support geeks for several years, but this contraption has tried my patience. It worked sporadically for a few weeks, sometimes had good signal strength, but mostly a weak one. Well, okay, the PC that used wireless was in another building in our house, so I was willing to give it the benefit of my doubt. Then I brought the PC into the same room as the WAP and tried to tweak and fiddle with the settings on both WAP and PC, hoping to zip up the speed and make the connection more reliable. I couldn't even get connected at that point. Updated the firmware to the latest. Reset everything to factory defaults, then painstakingly entered the WPA2 key and the SSID, plus the admin password, and all the other things like allowed MAC addresses, etc. Okay, so now I can SEE the network on my PC but I can't connect. Then after a few more connection tries, I couldn't even see the network, nothing, nada, no dice. So I've gone downhill, from a sporadic and usually slow connection in another building ... to not even seeing the wireless network while I'm literally sitting next to the WAP. That's it, I give up. I've wasted at least 50 hours on this device, it's definitely not worth the money.  I bought this because I already own an industrial-strength firewall/router and didn't need another router. Maybe that's where I went wrong, don't you do the same thing! Stay away from this money and time waster 
 Bottom line:  I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better.  This one is more to the original story.  I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling.  This book is more about the "facts" of the account.  No Al Bielek in this book 
 This was a Christmas peresent for my grandson.  The car worked one time and then would no longer go.  It still made the vrooom noise, but would not perform as advertised.  The price of the car was not worth haggling over for a new one, but I would definitely discourage the purchase of this product 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 i luv tony yayo cuz he is so rill wit his lirics and 50 cent is his frend and dey are rilly good rappers  yeah.......   
 I have checked out almost every card shuffler in the market. And I can tell you that apart from the one made by Excalibur they are all the same, and Cardinal is not an exception. So here is my review.  This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.   1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy  2. Door Stop  3. Play Street Hockey  4. Stress Release Stomping Toy  5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift  6. Modern Art for Coffee Table  7. Nerf Ball Target Practice  8. Condom Dispenser   Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!   PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it. 
 This movie needs a serious steroid boost on creativity, believability, and budget. AND can we say... just squish the leeches already. Not worth your time 
 The stories, without fail, were tame and harmless as a paperplate. I would recommend this book to couples trying to rekindle some sort of bland passion, or to those who feel that holding hands is a type of foreplay 
 I can't get it to stick! I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold, but as soon as I put toys in it, it falls 
 Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film 
 I was so excited when I found out about this album/dvd! Unfortunately I was expecting something like the David Bowie Best Of dvd. Now that is a collection! Why can't the record companies give the fans the complete picture? There are so many ommissions on this dvd it's mind boggling. Blondie deserves a double dvd collection with live performances, alternate videos, interviews, proper liner notes. Who wouldn't want to see when Debbie Harry was featured on the Muppet Show! That would be an amazing bonus. I am still holding out for a proper dvd release because this one doesnt cut it for me. After all this is the band that was JUST inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! Give Blondie the kudos they deserve and take a note from the David Bowie Best Of dvd---thats the sort of package the fans want and deserve. As well its the only fitting tribute to one of the premier women of punk/new wave in a world of plastic phonies like Britney Spears, Hillary Duff and Ashley Simpson! Anyone agree? 
 The book offers good introduction to Flex 2 and includes many tips as well.  But the big problem for this books is the writing style.  The examples are usually modified/enhanced examples from previous chapters.  But the authors relentlessly go through each line changes with a huge paragraph; it often looks something like "remove this line, add this component, and save".  A usual half page worth of content is bloated to 3, 4 pages of tedious step-by-step instructions.  I personally would prefer to see the code changes between 2 versions directly, something like a side-by-side code snippet comparison would do the trick 
 I own a boarding kennel, I thought this might be interesting but found it to be down right dangerous. In my clientel 9 out of 10 were severly bitten or attacked by their pets for trying this phony practice. Only the owner knows their dog, here is a tip for a problem pooch.. try spending quality time with fido, not only training sessons. Lie on the floor and play with your pet, brush your pet, hug your pet. Think and get to know the breed or mix of breeds before your purchase or adopt and see if they will work for you. Not every gimic pet device works, especially not this one. I cant wait until this phase is over with.  
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 I use a headset with this phone for meeting and both phones that I bought ended up static and the person on the line couldnt hear me cause the hole that the headset fits into is defective. 2 phones in two years and same problem in both of them. I recommend spending a little more for a better quality phone.   
 I thought this book was awful. The more you read, the clearer it becomes that Prasso approached her "research" with a pre-formed thesis, and either picks subjects to prop it up or filters their comments appropriately.  The author's condescension is annoying as heck. She's blatantly disdainful of some of her interviewees, like a sniveling Filipina prostitute, a white man living with a Chinese runway model, and a Chinese school administrator who - gasp! - admits she wants to get married and stop chasing promotions. Scoring an interview with the famous retired geisha Mineko Iwasaki is an accomplishment, certainly, but Prasso's self-congratulatory tone ruins it.  Argh I've totally lost patience with this book, I just wrote a review of it for a different website. Full review on my blog here if you're interested: [...]  As a Malaysian Chinese girl in a relationship a white American guy, I have a vested interest in arguing against Prasso's typifying of all Asian/white relationships being based on either unilateral or mutual exploitation. I'm not dating him because I want a green card, he's not dating me because he thinks I'm going to be docile and compliant - quite the opposite, in both cases. We like each other because we're frigging NERDS (science grad students bonding over SG-1 and Firefly).   As one of the young Japanese women interviewed says, "Junin toiro!" - Ten people, ten colours, yet this book tries to paint everyone with the same brush 
 This is probably the only show by Andrew Lyodd Webber that I do not like and the only show that Michael Ball has performed in that I think is utter trash. The story is confusing, and random I find myself think how much acohol Webber was on when he came up with this.  The story is trashy and although, it sucks some wonderful songs emerge- "Love Changes Everything" but, not enough to save the show from the melodramatic storyline. After the opening it goes downhill from there.My favorite part in the musical is when George says "cradle-snatcher."-- which says a lot about how good the musical is.   Michael Ball does a wonderful job and it's a pleasure to listen to his voice and the girl who plays Jenny but, nothing would manage to keep this show alive. Poor storyline and an over-dramatized script is what butchers this musical. Nice attempt by Ball.  All in all don't make the same mistake i did buy one of Andrew Lyodd Webber's greatest hits C.D. or one of Michael Ball's greatest hits C.D 
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 I wasn't really expecting much from a budget-label DVD set, but I do pick them up on the cheap when I can find them as a means of screening obscure or hard to find films. That way I can decide whether or not to seek out better, higher-quality editions.  In this instance, the films were the sort of 50's and 60's era blood and thunder you'd expect, but the faded, beaten and tinny-sounding public domain/TV prints used left them more anaemic and wheezing than blood and thunder.   The fault is not the films, but rather the shabby, low-budget source material and indifferent digital transfer.   As the previous reviewer stated, I would be embarassed to screen these for a Bible Study or film appreciation class, but for private home viewing they should tide you over until somebody releases better editions 
 I bought this book thinking it was going to teach me how to model a Female Character...I WAS DEAD WRONG!!This book DOES NOT teach anything about modeling,the only thing it says to do is create a box and extrude following the sketch outline.The programs covered in this book are mainly Poser(50%) Maya(15%) and Photoshop(35%)..They should call this book "How to pose and texture a character in Poser" because that is really all this book tells you to do..But if you want a book full of pictures of nude 3D Models then by all means buy this book. 
 I almost fell for it...then I realized, how in the world are those pearls so cheap??  They aren't real!  If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it.  It would be helpful if the item was advertised as "imitation pearl thong." 
 I take AP psychology and I cant believe are school bought this book. I have many psychology books and I really think the scenarios help one have a better understanding of psychology, especially if someone is not use to the language of psychology. This book revolves around three people, Marc, Todd and Dan and they just do really lame and boring things together and somehow Dr. Rathus makes correlations b/w them and psychology. Not only that, the author is just plane lazy, constantly referring to other books and authors all through the text presumably because he doesn't have any ingenuity at all. The worst of all of this book is that some of the information is just wrong, giving the reason why I had to give it one star. $82.00 is what "Dr. Rathus" and Holt should be paying me to just read this grotesque textbook 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 First, a full disclosure -- I run my own pet-sitting business and I'm a happy, paid member of Patti's organization, Pet Sitters Internaitonal (PSI).  She's a good business woman who had the sense to get out of the industry and create alliances to help those in the industry. Second disclosure, I run an organization geared directly toward helping petsitters start and run a successful business so that they can enjoy their life, work with great clients and retire happy.  Now, onto the review.  I bought this book about 6 months after I started sitting full-time.  I had already bought, read and devoured Lori and Scott Mangold's book.    This book was a disappointment to me -- it had been touted for so long by so many that I know and respect as THE BIBLE of pet-sitting.  So, I guess I was expecting fireworks and drumrolls.  None of that is here.  It's basic. It's not quite a how-to and definitely not the Complete Manual for Professional Success.  But then, a complete manual would need to be much larger and more expensive.    There are alot of ambiguities as noted by other reviewers and I really wish there was a more extensive Appendix listing places to get information regarding licensing, insurance, employees vs ICs etc. for each state.  But, there's still a good overview of the business here.  So it's worth having in your library -- I just wouldn't depend on this as my sole guide to starting and running a successful pet-care business.   
 I bought the book at the suggestion of Harv Eker, whom I respect. However, I found this book to be dogmatic and lacking the inspiration that I expected. I found that many of the chapters were dry, brief, and did not connect with me. I had the sensation of having someone who had heard "this is how to be productive with your time" from someone else and was passing on the cliff notes. Instead of this book, I would recommend Brian Tracy's Goals! - which gave me much more inspiration and practical exercises 
 I did not enjoy this book - it is very "Fundamentalist", which is fine if you are a Christain Fundamentalist - however, if you are not, then it's probably not the book for you 
 The introduction pretty well sums up the fatal flaw in this book: "But [this book] isn't a how-to book, it's a what-to book."  You have to ask: How much good is knowing what to do if you don't know how to do it? Go rebuild the engine in your car. I told you what to do; you will have to find out how to do it somewhere else. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else to begin with.  I bought this book to learn how to market my novels. I get: "In this respect [promotion] novelists are luckier than nonfiction writers. Not much is expected from them in the way of promotion.(page 87)" How much less? None? A little bit? Which ones of the 100 "weapons" should I use? Though I forced myself through the rest of the book and its interminably boring lists, I never found the answer.  I will have to say the authors practise what they preach. I would bet they have used all the gorilla (my spelling) weapons in this book, and then some, to sell every copy they can; including, I suspect, many of the glowing reviews on this page from members of their "network." You push my book and I will push yours.  It is a shame that American literature has come down to who is the best marketer. Maybe that is why many new novels, which used to keep me glued to my seat, now get slammed shut after the first few chapters. Maybe the next one will be better.  This book is cotton candy: real yummy but no substance: sugar air. The best part is the money-back guarantee, which the authors proudly proclaim, is a safe bet because most people won't take you up on it.  I have to give it some credit for the appendixes. Of course, you could get the same thing with a few simple internet searches, but I hate to be all negative.  If you buy this book, you may find yourself saying: "I've been guerillaed." 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 The pages in this book are unevenly cut. Customer support tells me that the publisher did this intentionally. It's incredibly annoying to read - difficult to get to the right page and it just doesn't feel right in my hands. Parker's work is, of course, exceptional - but find a copy of the old edition and steer clear of this one. 
 An easy read, this book is not necessarily accurate.  One example is in Lexa's claim that Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is the same as Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis).  It's obviously not.  The confusion probably stems from one of Goldenseal's other names, "Indian Turmeric", which is NOT the same as Turmeric the common spice.  Like many herbs, proper preparation is essential; goldenseal can paralyze the central nervous system and cause convulsions and respiratory failure in improper doses, so don't follow Lexa's advice to take it internally unless you are properly trained and/or medically supervised.  My suggestion to readers is to use this book for inspiration, but back up your research before working with the herbs by checking other sources for correspondences and toxicity.  Some herbs Lexa recommends for baths, ointments, incense, teas and the like are poisonous or carcinogenic.  Know what plants you are working with -- and how to do so safely -- from a reputable source before inhaling, wearing next to the skin, or ingesting them.  
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Bought for my wife and it is usless. Short battery life and poor suction. A total waste of money 
 I bought this book because it's a Six Sigma Handbook, but unfortunately it is not, is a book of SPC, it has a lot about control charts, run charts, etc. about hypothesis testing just a little!, anyway. I have to select better my books 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 This is a book on improvisational cooking only inasmuch as Schneider's own improvisations. If you, like me, bought this book thinking that it would provide the basis for your own improvisations, you'll be disappointed. Schneider 15-odd pages on mixing flavors will only enlighten if you haven't figured out by now that ginger mixes well with oriental dishes, that thyme goes well with poultry, and that salt and pepper are seasoning staples. What follows after these no-brainers is a typical recipe book with Schneider's own "improvisations."  Her recipes look interesting, but this is not at all the book that the title would seem to imply.  For much deeper and helpful insights into improvisational cooking, pick up instead Shirley Corriher's Cookwise 
 Two things about Mr. Tower's book are original. The use of menus to drive his narrative, and his food. Unfortunately, reading this book taught me more about James Beard's unmentionables than it did about Jeremiah Tower's food. Some things about Mr. Beard I just didn't want to know.  There was a bit of nostalgia to this book, since I remember Berkeley in the early 70s and can picture Mr. Tower fitting in perfectly with that environment. I am a fan of the Chez Panisse style of cooking and food presentation, and would be more than happy to give much of the credit for popularizing it to Mr. Tower. Unfortunately, he has engaged in a preemptive strike, and claimed it all.  I was not in the restaurant business in 1971. Actually, I was in the fourth grade business about then, so I can't say for certain that you couldn't get your tomatoes flown in from Ecuador back then, but I somehow doubt it. That there were produce markets in the city back then tells me that Mr. Tower wasn't the only one serving fresh produce. Did other restaurants buy their veggies and then sit on them for a week before serving them?  Still, I'll read through 224 pages of self love if I can learn something of the master's art. I learned this about Jeremiah Tower's food: Add salt 
 I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course.  At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal  usefulness.  When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was  introduced.  If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who  recommend other sources 
 My daughter was thrilled to get this for christmas with the rest of the set for the Little mommy doll.It came out of the box with easy basic instructions to put it together.BUT once it was put together my daughter went to put her doll in and it fell apart.Not the whole thing but the arm that holds the swing onto the base keeps falling off.My friends does the same nthing. Very cheaply made.Was not impressed at all. 
 There are many good things to say about this text. It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.  As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.  Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.  Not Recommended 
 What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good 
 I spent most of the time in fast forward, and don't think that I missed any of the plot. I gave it a 2 because it was not so bad that I turned it off. A good movie to put on in the backround, if you are not going to pay it much attention 
 I have only walked out of a handful of movies, and this was one of them.  Everything about this movie was contrived and stilted. While Blake Edwards has produced some classic movies, this simply is not one of them.  I recommend S.O.B if you're looking for a truly excellent Edwards fil 
 The information in this book more basic than I had expected. The quality of the paper and the printing is also very cheap. This book is definitely not worth the price I paid 
 This book takes the position that increasing technological infrastructure and investing in higher information technology does not increase productivity. The argument is complete hokum from beginning to end; however, it is very convincing due to the large amount of evidence presented and the prestige of the pseudoscientist promulgating it.   Most of the evidence presented exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which should be obvious to any logician or scientist reading it. However, several more subtle fallacies are also present. The subtlety comes in by virtue of the author failing to define `productivity.'  First, the author measures productivity using GDP. This is analogous to using the physics definition of work when you ask a man who's spent all day trying to tip over a mountain, "Why are you so tired? The mountain hasn't moved, therefore you haven't done any work!" GDP is a measure of output in terms of dollars. It does not measure work done, just how much was sold.   Second, the author uses return on assets to analyze investments in new equipment. Now, I'm no expert in finance, but since assets is in the denominator, using ROA in the way this author does (the ROA of the firm, not the investment decision) would systematically understate the positive effects of these investments. Net Present Value or Internal Rate of Return would both be much better measures.  Third, and this is related to the second point, the author compares firms to what they were in the past (before investing in technology) or to other, dissimilar firms. The relevant comparison is between a firm's current profitability and what the current profitability would have been if not for the investment. The common form of this reasoning is: XYZ Corp. made a huge technological investment in 1986, and experienced no rise in productivity (as measured by ROA). This ignores the possibility that the whole industry became more competitive, and failing to invest in the technology could have led to bankruptcy.   In a related issue, he completely ignores rising standards. His argument is equivalent to, Finding Nemo did not make significantly more money than The Lion King. Therefore, enhanced technology did not increase productivity. This is incorrect because productivity is a measure of work done over time, not money made. If animators tried to make a film with the graphics quality of Finding Nemo by hand, it would have taken several orders of magnitude longer, if it was even possible! The fact is, the animators, like so many workers in society, get far more done today than they used to, they just don't get paid anymore to do it, which is actually an argument for the value of technology.  I gave up on it shortly thereafter 
 After watching the film, I "studied" the interview with the director.  I can see what he tried to say and what kinds of films he wanted to make,  but I'm just curious to what extent the human mind is capable of handling the obscurity (i.e., not knowing who actually made the videos and delivered them to the couple). I do not think that the audience will be as cognitively active (i.e., being eager to engage in some abstract moral speculation about the protagonist's guilt over his memory or dreams) as the director wants to think. The more the audience want some closure, the worse their reactions will be to this film.   
 The author treats the media as if it is the devil. as if all tv, computers, etc are bad. This book wil surely destroy some child's lif 
 I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
 I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again 
 Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 This book is more of a student workbook with high level general information.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I have tried a few recipies out of book and none of them were very good.  I even threw out an entire pot of sauce and a whole pan of bars.  This is definetly not my favorite vegan cookbook 
 First off, let me just say that I LOVED the first three books. So when I learned that a fourth was to be released, I was thrilled. So when I got in and read it, I was really disappointed. A lot of the plot lines that Ann Brashares has been cultivating since book number 1 seemed to go out the window. It was almost as if she decided she didn't like them after all. Both Carmen and Lena had love interests at the end of the third book, yet neither is so much as mentioned. The third book made it seem like Lena had finally gotten over Kostos, and had moved on to Carmen's shy step-brother. Carmen meanwhile seemed quite happy with Win. Personally, I thought the character of Win was good for Carmen. In the fourth book, Carmen no longer even has Win, but she has turned into a shy, loner of sorts on the Williams college campus. My spring semester of college is just now ending, and I have to say that none of the girls' first years of college seemed accurate. No one could change as much as Carmen did in the first year. Bee finally has the man of her dreams, and it seems odd to me that she would forget Eric so fast and believe herself not to be in love with him anymore. Also, she never seemed to be the type to jet of to Turkey for a summer long dig. The dig also seemed unrealistic. From what I know of them, it takes a long time just to find one piece, yet they were finding whole skeletons and complete pieces of pottery. Not exactly realistic. Lena, the one character who I relate the most too, never would have posed nude for a fellow painter before. The character of Leo is almost to perfect, and not exactly believable. She also has reverted to dwelling on Kostos again. I thought she had gotten over him and had moved on to Paul. Kostos even makes an appearance in the book, in what is quite possibly the most bizarre scene I have ever read. I even had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on. The whole conclusion of her relationship with Leo was a bit sudden and unexpected as well. Now, on to Tibby. First of all, let me just say that I think it is way out of Brian's character to push sex with Tibby. I also think it is out of character for him to smuggle a bottle of wine into her dorm. While I do think he is the type of guy to visit her as often as he does, I still can't believe he rides a bus for 12 hours every weekend just to see her. It's understandable when Tibby freaks out over her pregnancy scare. However, I would have hoped she would have matured enough to not shut Brian out when he so obviously was trying to help her.  I could go on, but I won't. I will say that there were several nice scenes with Bridget, her father, and her brother Perry. Otherwise, I would recommend the just first three novels 
 This stuff is AWFUL - it goops up inside the bottle and won't pour out. I had to mix water with it just to get it out of the bottle! I only do a few washes a week, but STILL, it shouldn't have gelled up like that so fast. In fact, it should never gel up at all. I'll never buy any of the ALL Small & Mighty products again! What a waste!!! Rated 1 star because there is no ZERO star rating 
 This book really fell flat.  Lynne Hinton's first book Friendship Cake what such a good read.  I was sincerely disappointed in her second work.  She had a good beginning, but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant, and a little dull.  There was some hope of a good plot, but something was definitly missing.  Try again Lynne, you have talent.  Maybe try a sequel to Friendship Cake.  The characters that you developed in that book are really good

 I read this book with high hopes, as it seems to have been highly regarded by many who have dealt with autism.  However, I was quite disappointed by it, on several levels.  The depiction of Daniel's autism is very textbook---I got very little sense of him as an actual little boy.  He followed the book on autism too exactly---right down to obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine.  The methods that helped him, which although this isn't spelled out seemed to be a modified form of Floor Time, were not really convincing to me.  This book failed most for me as a novel, though, not as an autism portrait.  The characters never came to live for me in any way.  Melanie's estranged husband, Stephen, comes across as such a cold fish that it's impossible to understand why anyone would have fallen in love with him in the first place.  Andy is such a stereotype of the rural, uneducated natural angel that I can't buy it at all.  A few characters are thrown in for reasons I can't totally fathom---what purpose do Larry or Veena serve?  However, I did keep reading until the end, and I had mild interest in the outcome.  I am glad autism is finding its way into popular literature, but I hope it can be written about in a more skilled matter in the future

 While I cannot say that I didn't like "Kingdom Come," it certainly left me wanting, which was unfortunate since this is the grand conclusion of the Left Behind series. Overall this was by no means a poorly written book as I truly enjoy Jenkins' style of writing and his use of imagery in not just the LB series, but also the "Soon" and "Jesus Chronicles" series. But I didn't care for the novel's progression and several series of events that took place. The book begins well, with our usual crew about to enter the Millennial Kingdom and the theological explanations by Tsion Ben-Judah on what to expect as far as the early deaths of non-believers, everyone's new eating habits, the constant brightness, animals of all kind living in peace with people, and of course the physical presence of Jesus on his throne in Jerusalem were very helpful in setting the tone. We see Rayford, Irene, Tsion and co. assigned to various ministries throughout the world and Buck and Chloe have founded a millennial day care called Children of the Tribulation (COT). In addition, Jesus has cleaned up the whole earth after the horrors of the tribulation and has set up his new temple in Jerusalem where he will rule forever. After establishing these initial key elements, the book jumps to 93 years into the Millennial Kingdom, where we learn about the formation of The Other Light (TOL), which is a Lucifer-worshipping cult whose followers hope to overthrow Christ in the final battle. After quickly reaching year 93, I thought the story would keep moving quickly throughout the Millennium in order to spend a good amount of time on the final battle between Satan and Jesus. However, the next 300 pages or so covered only years 93-97 in the Kingdom, which I found extremely tedious. At one point, we see Rayford requesting to King David that some major biblical characters come and speak at COT, which he obliges. When Noah visits and tells his story, I found it to be a nice filler, but nothing really special. But the fact that later on, Joshua and Caleb and then later David himself each come and share their stories in excruciating detail (when one can just pick up a Bible and read the same things) was pretty disappointing and way too page consuming when other storylines could have been pursued. One aspect that I truly did enjoy was that Buck & Chloe's son, Kenny Williams was the unofficial main character of this book at the tender age of 97. The formation of the Millennium Force was a bit cheesy, yet nostalgic to faithful LB readers who journeyed along with the original Tribulation Force. And Kenny and Ekaterina's romance was well done and makes you feel like a grandparent after having read the Buck & Chloe saga from early in the series. A big conflicting issue for me was when TOL infiltrator Qasim planted false evidence implicating Kenny as an unbeliever and a mole at COT. Kenny then loses his girlfriend and his Uncle Raymie (who has a glorified body and mind for crying out loud) initially turns on him as do several others. Kenny agonizes and feels totally alone and ostracized, which I find pretty jacked up considering this is a time of global peace and tranquility. It shouldn't have been hard for Kenny to prove his loyalty to Christ, especially with Jesus physically present right in his home town. Somehow I'd like to think Jesus wouldn't be some unaccessable VIP, sitting in his temple all alone, which is pretty much how he was portrayed in this book. Believers prayed to him, but even then, they didn't know if they were receiving his answers or making up their own. Why couldn't Kenny have said, "You don't believe me? Let's go see Jesus and he'll tell you I belong to him!" I'd like to think that Jesus would never have a problem with his own children coming to him for counsel, especially now that he was physically present with them. Also, throughtout the series, believers had seals of the cross spiritually placed by God on their foreheads identifying them as followers of Christ - why were they now absent?? A redeeming storyline was Abdullah's ministry to the TOL, which showed a really gracious picture of how we are to love our enemies. But throughout it, he seemed to keep second guessing himself, wondering if he was really supposed to be there. And again I wondered, why didn't he simply go and meet with Jesus and ASK him?? Rayford's kidnap and subsequent miraculous release were entertaining and brought back small flashbacks of the action in the original series. And it was also interesting to find out exactly who it was that blessed Tsion on the bus instead of arresting him in "Nicolae" (book 3). But suddenly, at the end of the second to last chapter, in a matter of two pages and in completely past tense, we find Kenny exonerated, and the next 900 years are quickly glossed over in minor detail, disappointingly bringing us to the final battle in the last few pages of the book. This makes no sense to me since the 7 year tribulation took up 12 books, yet 900 years in the Millennial Kingdom took 2 pages. The final battle with the armies of Satan, the casting of Satan into hell, the Great White Throne Judgment, and the creation of the new heaven and new earth were quickly done in a few paragraphs and much of it was by directly quoting Revelation. I mean, I understand that this won't even be a true fight, but this is a fictional account and as the CLIMAX of the whole SERIES, it should have been drawn out and paraphrased rather than spending so much time early on, rehashing old stories by not one, but four Old Testament characters. I was glad however, to see the final moments in the book being told from Rayford's viewpoint, as he is the star of the series. Overall, this was not a horrible book, but I expected much more from the finale to this amazing and heartwarming series. "Kingdom Come" is certainly a must if you have read all the previous books in the series, though on its own, it's not very strong. My overall thought, as others have also stated, is that if a trilogy was going to be written, it should have been done on the Millenial Kingdom, with perhaps only a single book for the prequel after the initial series was complete 
 This book is an absolute rip-off.  Crude drawings surround chapters devoted to the most common stances and thrusts; given fancy, exotic names.   The historian in me enjoyed the author's recollections of life in Sicily  fifty (or so) years ago.  However, as a knife fighter's text, this book  lacks 
 In all my years of reading books this is the first time that I have felt compelled to destroy a book once I have read it to avoid inflicting the torment of its pages upon another family member or friend.  This is one of those book that at every page turn you expect the book to come alive and at the end you question why anyone would have spent so long on a piece of work in which nothing actually happens. Then you question your own sanity for persevering for so long.  I have never read another Martin Amis book but still urge everyone to read 'Lucky Jim' written by the clearly more gifted father of Martin Amis. 
 My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a huge Munch fan and likes this one well enough, but it's my least favourite.  She tends to memorize books and quote them constantly, and I'm not thrilled with the "hey, you dumb...." mantra.  This is kind of minor, but how was it that the pigs showed up at school after Megan locked them back in at home? If you're wanting to add to your Munch collection, he's written better.  Alligator Baby and Thomas's Snowsuit are fun without the insults and a little more logically consistent 
 The REA CLEP History of the US I study guide is in need of improvement and/or revision!   The format of the book and the accompanying CD-ROM is very usable...but the problem is that the information in it has little to nothing to do with the real exam that was taken yesterday.  The actual exam results were 20 points less than I scored on each of the 3 practice exams in the book.   These practice exams and explanations gave a false sense of readiness.   I wish I would have used the actual study materials from the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).   When I called REA about the difference between the study guide's practice exams and the actual exam....they said I should write a review online?  So, I am alerting people to use other study materials than this REA study guide (published in 2006).  It resulted in wasted time and money for me 
 After reading this book I've concluded in 1960 - 68 I must have attended the most progressive Pennsylvania rural farm school! Back then we began every day with a greeting to our teacher and classmates, a sharing called  "show and tell" rules for behvaior - called The Ten  Commandments" were posted on the blackboard and our student work was  displayed daily and at PTA meetings - oh and we also had individual  education goals - it was called the homework list posted daily! I think if  we have reached the point in America that teachers need to teach children  how to say hello, how to behave towards others, etc. we are in BIG trouble  as a nation. These are skills we learned in church and in our home and yes  back then out teachers and principal read from the BIBLE every day! This  book is trying to reinvent the wheel and in the process stealing the ideas  of Maria Mountessours- such as circle time each morning, work stations,  display art - all of which she knew in the 1800s. I do not recommend this  book. I recommend teachers read Maria's work and work for the day when  teachers are free to clearly state when something is morally right or  wrong 
 GREAT CAST / HORRIBLE SCRIPT / LAUGHABLE PERFORMACES / A WASTE OF TIME , MONEY & FILM / THEY PUT SOO MUCH MAKEUP ON THE VERY BEAUTIFUL CATE BLANCHETT THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE CARNIVAL CLOWN  & THAT IS SAD / DEPP LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO KILL SOMEBODY / RICCI PLAYS A RUSSIAN LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE VIRGIN AND TURTURRO LIP SINGS OPERA AS A HORSE RELIEVES HIMSELF ON THE STAGE / SOUNDS LIKE A COMEDY BUT IT IS NOT / STAY CLEAR OF THIS DISASTER PLEASE 
 The liberation of Paris was a coup de grace for the Allies.  Paris did not suffer the fate of Berlin or Stalingrad, to name a few cities, in becoming a contested battleground.  Nor, as the book pointed out, did the German commander follow Hitler's orders to destroy the city's major monuments, bridges, and other sites.  It is interesting to note his actions in view of other German officers' claims that they were "only following orders".  However, this book is written by two journalists rather than historians, so it does not have the academic research nor analytical insight that a serious work might have.  Cornelius Ryan comes closer to the style of writing that might have made this a heavier book.  This is understandably difficult, in some ways, given the relative sparcity of combat and drama; or so this book would suggest.  Again, a better writer and researcher would find more material to include.  Some material that might be considered, for example, are Allied intelligence estimates, Axis intelligence estimates, operational orders, etc.  It is not clear to me, for example, how the German commander could fail to execute Hitler's orders in August 1944 when the Gestapo and SS were omni-present, especially after the failed July plot on Hitler's life.  Moreover, good research might show to what extent the Allies knew of Hitler's intentions.  The Allies had significant intelligence capabilities, not the least through Ultra.  And if they knew of the plans to destroy large parts of Paris, why didn't they send in commandos and special forces to disarm any explosives?  Indeed, the French themselves seemed to put a higher priority on erecting road blocks rather than disarming explosives.  This is an easy, enjoyable read; and one of the few on the subject in English.  However, it's about time someone else updated and added value to this book 
 Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".  O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.  This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.  "Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never! 
 I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING!   You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong.   The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.    Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.  I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!  
 I have read a few things by Lattimore, and while he is touted as the most accurate translator of Greek literature, I find him increadibly difficult to read. His sentences sometimes make no sense at all.  English is a language that depends upon syntax and the order of words in a sentence; Greek is not this way, it is a language with myriad declensions and conjugations, effectively allowing its poets to manipulate a sentence's word order.  Lattimore may simply be too accurate to the Greek originals, because the word order--translated so precisely--simply does not fit well in the English. I recommend Fagles, who is an amazing translator; and while he is accurate, he also understands the limitations of translating the Greek to English. His sentences are fluid and capture the life of the translation. For Aeschylus, I also recommend Philip Vellacott. Check out Fagles, then check out Vellacott. But please forego the Lattimore translations, unless you really want to understand just the sort of impact a bad translation can have. 
 I think this book is the worst Hardy Boys book ever.This book is so poor I think it wasn't even made by Franklin W. Dixon.I would give it one star but I have to give it some credit.Listen to me and don't get this book 
 My thanks to Mr Gordon Brown for commenting on my previous review. In that review I claimed that a weaker version of the Girasanov's theorem is proved ( this is correct)and that the author does this by impossing a weaker ( this should have read stronger, my apologies) condition. The remainder of my comments still stand. Specifically, it is not a priori clear form the premises that condition 4.3.1 on page 187, is indeed satisfied. Finally, Mr Gordon's last remark regarding the credibility of my person deserves no comment 
 Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 The only reason I am reading this book is because it is mandatory for my American history class in college. I am on page 139, and Mary Norton has still not even remotely reached an accessible theory. I don't know if she's going to or not. One can only hope. To say this is the worst book I've ever read would be an exaggeration, but not a great one. Mary Norton CANNOT make a cohesive point. She rambles extensively and flips about in time, so even if you were familiar enough with the story to know what happened, you'd still probably have a hard time following this account. It's nearly impossible to keep track of what's going on, and just when you think you might have a weak grasp on the story, she goes into a completely unrelated topic. I think she is trying to link them together, but the book moves so incredibly slowly that by the time you've finished a page, you've forgotten what happened before then. It's just a singularly dry (and under-edited) account of an interesting incident in history. I would not recommend this book for voluntary reading. 
 I bought this to hopefully hear some of the songs in the movie. Especially the one when they are steppin/dancing. Unfortunately I only recognized a couple of songs from the movie. Not sure where the rest were. Most notably the Trick Daddy/Ozzy mix - "Let's Go", which was in the previews and the movie was not even on the soundtrack. The best thing I can say is it is clean enough to let my kids put on their ipods 
 In Santa Fe, Scott plays an ex-Confederate soldier who ends up working for the expanding Santa Fe railroad. His brothers, who also served with him in the War, are still angry at the Union, and develop their own band of outlaws who are determine to make the Union pay for the suffering of the South. Scott is caught between his own flesh and blood and his desire to help build the railroad as it stretches through the Western wilderness.  Scott is entertaining as always, and there's some decent action in Santa Fe, but this is only an okay film 
 It's quite amazing to how much length monopolists of all kinds will go to defend their position, even after they've been proven utterly wrong!  The horrible, stupid and disasterous consequences of government interference in market processes should not require further demonstration, but here we go: yet another idiot who tries to prove that "markets are wrong".  Kuttner doesn't get it: markets are OUTCOMES of incredibly large number of choices millions of people make. To say that some outcomes (momentary snapshots of ongoing, complex processes) is not "perfect" or "desirable", he argues from HIS personal perspective. Maybe indeed HE would have liked to allocate ressources differently, but it is the outcome of billions of individual decisions.  The implicite assumption by Kuttner is that some "central agency" would know better. WRONG! As history teaches, any attempt at centralizing decision making FAIL, precisely because of limited knowlege and the complexity of any real problem.  Let's take the example discussed elsewhere on this forum: airline deregulation. Apparently, there are many "negative consequences" and somehow, Kuttner doesn't like the current system very much. Well, that's HIS take. I assume he always was rich enough to pay excessively high air fares, contrary to the majority of people, who can only afford flights since the industry has been deregulated.  Some companies fail. SO WHAT? That's part of the market process!!! Some companies provide bad seats, lousy service and have a slightly higher accident risk. SO WHAT? That's the point about a market: you are allowed to choose a really cheap, crappy solution. You're not FORCED to spend huge amounts of money, when all you want is to get cheaply from point A to point B! If you are WILLING to pay more - up to the ridiculous price levels from before deregulation, then you probably get a very high level of quality and service.  As usual, Kuttner simply forgets about the fact that lousy quality is often the only way of making certain goods and services available to the not-yet-wealthy. Our grand-parents had to put up with things of incredibly shabby quality, as compared to what we have now. No one served up high quality on a silver platter at low cost.  Worst of all is that a HUGE number of examples of "bad markets" actually are due to "bad regulations", but it takes brains to spot the unintended consequences of regulations, if all you ever read is the declaration of intent of any law. 
 Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews.  It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys.  It didn't bode well.  As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational.  The music has been called "lush," however I think it leans more to "trying too hard."  It is all far too overdone.  The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion.  All in all, a great disappointment 
 While the murder mystery was well set up, the ending was more of Agatha Christie ending, with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator. The political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough. This is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet. But you didn't feel that pain from the governor. The 4 law Robot introduced isn't given the same exploration that Caliban was in the first book. You do not get behind his head. The pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us. This missed the boat 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes

 Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the "Print as Image" selection for anything that is scanned.  Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it.  BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe product 
 Two cents from a rank amateur/beginning programmer. At the moment, I'm on page 179 of this book and the main problem I have so far is with the way the information is communicated. Personally, I now know that I should have picked up a book that taught VB concepts via small projects and tasks. A "in chapter 1 we'll build a simple tool to get familiar w/ the IDE. In chapter 2 we'll improve our skillset by building a slightly advanced tool to learn about declaring variables, etc." approach would work better for me. Unfortunately, this book doesn't  really do that. The concepts here are explained mostly with bits of standalone code. Hopefully, perhaps by page 200, we'll commence with some "learning by doing." Yes, hopefully. In the meantime, I'll grit my teeth and continue with the book, but right now it simply isn't working for me 
 I wanted to read Ms. Kaminer's book with an open mind, which is exactly how I started after picking it up from my local library.  However, in her introductory comments she refers to an author as "Beverly DeAngelis."    It's Barbara DeAngelis, by the way, and she has a PhD.    If Ms. Kaminer can't be bothered to fact-check her work, then I really shouldn't be bothered reading it.  
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 Before you read the book, look at the sources.  I only found one scientific paper out of hundreds of sources. Everything else has to be classified as opinions.  Sources for this book  include news stories and testimonies in congress.  I will point out by two examples (not from the book, but from information that you are probably familiar with) why these are not good sources. I recall the news stories based on the opinions of experts that said it would take five years to put out the oil well fires started in the first Gulf War.  They were all wrong.  It took six months.  CEO's and others testified before congress about tobacco products being non-addictive.  Were they correct? No! So when we read this book, we can't be sure of anything.  It is a book of opinions and ideas.  Some of them may be good, but they may also be bad.  This is why we have science and the scientific method.  Even science may be corrupted at times or fail until we have a better understanding. Even if Mr. Gore had scientific papers, it is unlikely that he could judge whether they really support his environmental views.  He would need a Ph.D. or at least a lot of experience in the proper field(s) to interpret scientific papers properly.  This book discusses how corporations are unfriendly to the environment. Surely some of them are.  But so is the government.  When the government plant at Fernald, Ohio, (near Cincinnati) was accused of poluting the soil and water with radioactive waste, the government denied, dragged its feet, and fought in court. The government lost it case because there was obvious guilt, but the government did not hestitate to fight against the very people it represents. When you or I appear to be at fault in an auto accident, do we admit it and offer to pay all claims, or do we take a less candid approach as our insurance company suggests?  We might even think we are not at fault. Mr. Gore has denied being at fault countless times in his political career, but he can't believe that a corporation should do anything but admit guilt, accept every environmental claim that is made, and pay large sums of money.  Mr. Gore is an elitist.  First, he believes that he is an environmental expert because he has heard a lot of opinions. He doesn't need an advanced degree in environmental science  or experience in that field.  He just knows better because he is Al Gore. Secondly, he sees how he uses the environment and how you should use the environment quite differently.  When he was Vice President, he flew to Kyoto, Japan, to symbolically (read unnecessary trip) approve the Kyoto Treaty.  He used more than 180,000 gallons of fuel in a private government plane in one day.  My wife and I can drive our cars and heat our house for our lifetimes and never use this amount of fuel.  During his Presidental campaign, Mr. Gore would fly a private jet to his son's games.  I have no great objection to the former Vice President doing these things as long as he doesn't start telling me how I am abusing the environment, that I should drive an electric car, ...  I do have trouble believing his environmental views are anything but political.  If you like the views in the book, read it and feel good.  If you don't like the views, read it for some good laughs.  There are plenty of flaws.  Books like this make money, but they don't make good science, and they don't produce good policy.  Don't forget to recycle the book 
 A friend of mine read this aloud to me while I was making dinner. Read aloud, there's nothing here but Welsh worship. It's done pretty well, but, really no one should have to read this book 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 This book is an opinionated overview of some scientific literature relating to human behavior, intermixed with a conservative political agenda and some light-hearted humor.  The book is divided into 4 sections: "In the Beginning" (a scientific history of the world, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humans), "The Rise of Humanity" (hormones and human behavior), "The World Today" (discussion of recent social changes), and "A Look Ahead" (possible futures).  End material includes a short annotated list of books for further reading (8 books plus a list of interesting authors), and an index.  There are no footnotes, endnotes, or other forms of citation of source materials.  I found the best part of the book to be the second section, in which Gilbert summarizes much research regarding innate human behavior relating to gender, romantic pairing, work, and child raising.  While I found little of this information new, Gilbert does an admirable job of presenting it in non-technical language for general readers.  Unfortunately, his complete avoidance of citation makes it impossible to check the accuracy or reliability of his points.  He also tends to overlook facts that would not be supportive of his general thesis that women should be pregnant and raising babies while men are out gathering resources for the family.  For example, after summarizing various statistics about how pregnancy and childbirth reduce risk factors for certain cancers, he states "Early pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, and breastfeeding are simply healthy. Childbirth carries risk, of course, but so does crossing the street or taking an aspirin. Not giving birth seems riskier still." Phew!  I guess he's never heard of the term "maternal mortality."  One of the main claims of the book is that boys and men are being done a disservice by a politically correct agenda which seeks to make the educational and work environments unisex.  As support, Gilbert calls on studies that found children learn better in gender-segregated schools, but suggests that such gender-segregation should be abandoned by the college years "when the maturing sexes really do belong together." (Why stop gender segregation after high school?  The research that supports gender segregated education certainly doesn't show that the advantages of gender segregation are not also found in college-aged students as well.)  He rails against Title IX legislation, which required educational institutions that provide sports programs to provide equal opportunities for men and women athletes, since he feels that by nature, men have stronger physical and mental needs to participate in competitive sports.  (While he supports his arguments against Title IX with examples of perhaps absurd situations in which popular men's programs have been cut so that women's sports with sparse participation could be funded, he entirely overlooks the fact that before Title IX, athletic women had an almost impossible battle to be able to find any playing field to compete on at many schools).  In Gilbert's view, the world would be a better place if women would stick to child-raising and house-keeping, and leave the workplace free for men to live out their genetically determined hunter/gatherer/impregnator behaviors.  He cites hundreds of societal ills, from declining test scores to the widening gap between rich and poor, implicitly suggesting that they all go back to feminism and the re-gendering of society.  In his argument that gender-linked human behaviors are innate and should determine societal structure, Gilbert overlooks normal genetic variation.  While on average, men are taller than women, there are millions of individual women who are taller than millions of individual men.  Likewise, there are no doubt millions of individual women whose competitive urges outpace those of individual men, and many men whose desire to focus on child raising is stronger than the desire of many women to do the same.  In the realignment of society that has occurred particularly in the latter half of the last century, legislation and societal mores have changed so that individuals are freer to follow their own specific genetically determined behaviors.  Brilliant, competitive women are no longer confined to housework, but are free to pursue professional careers if they wish, while their husbands can stay at home with the children if that better suits their temperament.  No society is perfect, and we are far from achieving a perfect match between inherent personality traits and roles in society, but the proposals of this book would take us backwards, not forwards in allowing people to live up to their genetic potential. 
 I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera. After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate. I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers. 
 This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
 The centuries surrounding the beginning of the Second Christian Millenium are a relatively unknown time even among those, such as myself, with an interest in History.  The light that was shed on this time by the book was interesting to me, as were the concepts of Paris as a small town and Europe as a wilderness.  While some of the characters were interesting, the narrator spent too much time telling what was happening rather than showing it (i.e. through dialogue).  The made the book difficult to get throug, especially in the final chapters. *spoiler* The symbolism of the book was unclear as well, most especially the strange cottage to which the young black slave fled after stumbling on it.  I felt some of the sexual descriptions were gratuitous and unecessary and while the refusal of the author to give the wives names seemed to echo the tendendcy in the Bible to do the same to women, the Bible does give names to those who play an important role.  Although I disagree to the reveiwer that this was done with mysoginist intent.  Unfortunately the symbolism was either too subtle for the average reader or it completely missed the mark, and I lean toward the latter 
 I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new... I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for. If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts 
 This text displays a plethora of simplistic, presumptuous and shallow typologies purporting to explain what is a leader and why it has to be so. Without any concern for contemporary social studies the author tells us  about what inborn qualities signifies a female leader, why there are fewer  black leaders than white ones ("scientifically proven" low  cognitive ability according to the author, pp. 740-741), and the litany  goes on. It is baffling that this stuff is still available in the book  market as anything else than obscure reminiscences of American social  science in a time we rather forget about 
 I was very disapointed with this book.  First it is a self published book that needs to be proof read and the font selected is horrid and hard to read.  Secondly, this is Stringfellow's soap box about her ex husband and work troubles.  It kept sounding like she was taking revenge on these people with her words, it just didn't set well with me.  The part that she did talk about Faith the dog, she really didn't go into any great detail.  Pass on this book and get Grim's book about Quentien, the dog who survived the gas chamber, its a much better read 
 Save your valuable time and steer clear of this train wreck!  Worse yet, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life if you make an important decision based on Retirement Places Rated. Sorry, but I get upset after having my time and money wasted, and just need to vent. I've spent a career in corporate relocation, and find myself stunned at most of the recommendations.  The book's choices usually fall into the following categories; unaffordable, uninteresting, uninhabitable, unsafe, unpleasant, unhealthy, or uncomfortable. On top of the flawed and biased reviews that might have been researched from chamber of commerce web sites, the book's layout requres endless page flipping to get the full profile of each city. And yes, I said biased.  As a West Coaster, where are the cities west of the Rockies?  There are very few included, representing a strong East Coast leaning, maybe because the author sticks to what he can drive to. Please, Mr. Savageau, invest in a Jet Blue ticket and take a trip out here.  Spend some time out here, in person, and maybe you'll avoid mistakes like your #1 choice - Florence, Oregon. I asked an associate from the Northwest about this town as the nation's top retirement spot, and she laughed, "Retire there?  I don't even like to drive through Florence!  Has this guy ever been there?" Good question!  
 I apologize the the children's author for mis-using the title of a very good book, but it seemed so right!  Assuming that the Greeks lived much like the Oliver Stone asserts, and why not, then it was hard to be Macedonian, Greek, and royal.  There is enough angst in this movie for the rest of Alexander's cut short life.  Three hours of this much angst is three hours too much.  I give it 2 stars for the scenery, the story that is probably pretty spot on, and the fact that someone had the good sense to have Sir Anthony Hopkins and Christpher Plummer in the movie.  They are the redeeming features of the whole thing.  But I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue.  Read a good book about it!!  Sorry, Oliver, but it's JFK all over again.  Plausible, but just not the case 
 I received the DVD and it skips, I was very dissatisfied.  I would have returned it , but since I have never had a problem before, I had thrown the receipt away.  Patrice Trace 
 First of all, let me tell you how to make money in America.  1. Blame all the problems America on a specific group of people, preferably people that don't have too much money and or politcal influence.   2. Pretend to be conservative and cuss at anyone or any group you dispise.  3. Have a talk show and talk about the same repetitive topics everyday nonstop.   I come from a very conservative family, and I supported Bush during 2004. I believe that abortion and cloning aren't very moral, but I believe that at the same time, you should always look at both sides of an issue before you make a decision and to RESPECT people for who they are and NOT blame them for every other issue in America. I have liberal friends, but we usually don't discuss politics and find common ground elsewhere. Before trying to change others, you should always think whether what you do are moral and logical.  Spreading Hate is what the Savage is doing. He calls the terrorists extremists, but doesn't even think about what kind of hate he is spreading. The terrorists want America to divide in this critical time period of ours. Savage only helps them prevail so please don't waste time listening to him on the radio and reading his books.    
 This book is embarrassing.  In my opinion the Vault Career Guide to Marketing and Brand Management is a superior guide to careers in marketing.   Good luck 
 When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This "novel," however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a "horror story" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, "How did THAT get published?" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid. 
 I thought my 18 month daughter would enjoy this book, especially since she was a fan of the "Five Little Monkeys Jumping on a Bed". But this book never captured her interest. I have never gotten past the 3rd page... till this day, I still don't know how the story ends! 
 As a great fan of dog stories, I had enjoyed one of this author's tales excerpted in a dog story anthology, and thought that I might relish more of her work.  Was I ever WRONG!!!  Half or less of the book was related to canines, and then often remotely.  Many of her works (this is a compendium of essays) are spoiled by her frequent use of the most vile, crude, and vulgar expletives, always unnecessary and adding nothing to the story.  Although humorous on the rarest of occasions, this tome consists mainly of the mindless babblings of the typically self-loathing liberal.  Unfit even as a chew toy for your pup 
 I'm a Wiccan who formally practices within a traditional Gardnerian coven, but practices eclectically within my private practice. I read this book because I had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a Christian; purportedly, Wicca's Charm was written by an impartial writer. Immediately, you realize that this isn't true. Catherine Sanders has a clearly stated agenda: that Wiccans are simply misguided and  misunderstand that what they long for is offered by Christianity.   I could write a long review debating the merits of Sanders' arguments. Instead, I suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which Sanders claims to have thoroughly researched. She relies on the writings of Margot Adler, Carol Christ, Starhawk and Phyllis Curott (with barely a nod to Scott Cunningham and Ronald Hutton) to draw many of her conclusions. Yet, missing from her notes are such writers as the Farrars, Merlin Stone, Raymond Buckland, Isaac Bonewits, Patricia Crowley, and the Matthews, to name just a few outstanding contributors to Neopaganism's base of knowledge.   Too often, Sanders relies on the statements of young Wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive. In another case, she bases her thesis that women's spirituality (e.g., Goddess worship)is misguided and that Christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via ONE speech that she heard Margot Adler give shortly after 9/11.   Sanders requests both Christians and Neopagans to read her book with an open mind. A fair request. But as you're reading, closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind, or whether Sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that Christianity has everything that a Wiccan desires. One needs to go no further than to consider that as Sanders attempts to persuade the reader that Christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of Paul. 
 I can't help but feel like I've been let down in some way.  I understand that an artist must follow his or her vision, but in this case I found the end result to be boring and bland. Not only that, but this album doesn't rock, as some reviews have indicated. It felt like a misconstrued hodgepodge of music, almost as if Casey can't figure out what the heck she wants to do. I felt like I had been trapped in easy listening hell. After being in love with The Captain and Barricades & Brick Walls for years, this honestly is a tremendous let-down 
 Leveen's book is much like the products he is famous for: slight, expensive, and possibly overblown.  Which isn't to say there aren't kernels of knowledge one can derive from the book.  Unlike many Levenger products, the book is about achieving a deeper relationship with reading and not about looking good while doing it.  To achieve a well-read life, Leveen suggests that you 1) make a list of books you want to read and keep them in categories (Leveen is fairly insistent that you buy the books you want to read - he obviously hasn't considered how expensive that might be); 2) practice the SQ3R method (survey, question, read, recite, review) and preferably write in your books; consider audio books as an addition to, but not replacement of, "reading"; join a reading group.  And that's the book in a nutshell.  There are no a-ha moments unless you're one of those people who doesn't believe in audiobooks, and shame on you if you are.  There is little here that anyone who has ever asked him or herself the question "how can I read more?" hasn't already considered.  In fact, the book made me a little uneasy for two reasons.  First, Leveen's overwhelming need to "possess" books he has or might want to read.  There is little discussion of public libraries and the value they provide to those who cannot afford personal libraries.  Second, Leveen's insistence that writing in one's books is important.  Yes, such an activity can improve one's understanding of the book, but frequently one can't write in a book (library) or would prefer not to (expensive/valuable, such as a first edition).  Writing marginalia is often not nearly as effective as taking real notes 
 I completely agree with TonyGreen7.  This book was a total disappointment.  How are you supposed to learn such a complicated technology when have the time you are fighting your way through typos, ommissions and grammatical errors. UGH!!!! 
 The best thing about this book are the repro photos of Hemingway and his contemporaries.  Sadly, the author's own photos, scavenged from his previous trip files, are mostly poor stock.  The same can be said of his writing.  There are no new nor creditable insights into Hemingway here, in fact you will mainly learn about author Ondaarje's own quirks and predelictions, ad nauseum.  Ondaatje is not a hunter, knows nothing of hunting, and yet presupposes his ability to dissect "Hemingway in Africa" when in fact hunting was the sole motivator for Ernest's 1933 trip to the dark continent.  It's like a medical biography penned by a chimney sweep.  You will get very little insight into Ernest Hemingway as the book wanders hither and yon.  Even worse, the book is full of factual errors and shaky assumptions as Ondaatje waddles over the landscape searching Hemingway's trail.  Ondaatje had previously been in Africa for a book on British explorers Speke and Burton.  It is apparent he decided to capitalize on that experience and become a literary critic.  He has failed miserably.  Buy the book for the pictures, nothing else... 
 alright, I was forced to read this book as part of the 10th grade English ciriculum at my school these past three weeks, and I must say this is the single worst book I have had the misfortune of reading. First off, I understand that Gibbons was trying to emulate the writing style of the 9-10 year old southern girl in older times, but the style only made reading the book that much more of a chore. My main quip with this novel is exactly that, it is a novel. This is not a true story, this is fiction, and I must say that for fiction, it is incredibly boring, uneventful, and tiresome. The formula for chapters or sets of chapters usually would consists of something unfortunate happening in her "past life" as I will call it, then switching back to talking about her new life as a foster child and the incredibly ordinary events of that life, then repeat. The book's monotonus pace, along with its uneasy readability put me to sleep while reading it. Twice. Basically nothing happens in the story that makes it any more exciting or depressing. The wole thing seems to just be dragging on to no climax or end, and when it finally does finish, it stops at a point that at any other point in the book could very well have been the end of any chapter, followed by more of its nonschalant happenings. Maybe I'm missing the whole "young girl overcomes adversity and grows as a person" bit -which I know that some people are fond of-, but if that's all that this book is offering, a small insight into an imaginary girl who had a tough upbringing and the daily grind she endures, then this book really to me has no point in being written.   thank you for reading the rant of a 16-year-old fuled by the over-analyzation of an overly-simple book 
 I owned this book, 4th Edition, from my previous courses in EE.  As a matter of fact, I wouldn't recommend this book to undergraduate students if they really want to nail down in Microelectronic, which is based on the facts -- this book is very hard to understand from the authors explanations beside the exercises solutions and solving techniques.  I feel very regretted that I owned this book because I could have another book better than this one in the past 
 This will probably be an unpopular review.  First, there can be no doubt that the men of the platoon of the story did their duty with bravery and competence.  Second, the book is reasonably written and appears to be well researched and thorough.  Having said that, this book seems to try too hard to exaggerate the importance and distinction of the short-term actions of a single platoon.  What is so unusual is that the book itself provides the evidence to counter this repetitive implication.  The actions of the men of this platoon were no more heroic than 90% or more of the line soldiers caught up by the battle of the bulge or any other major action of wars.  The critique that follows is not intended to lessen their sacrifice and bravery, but to try to put it in some perspective.  I include some details of the book.  Do not read on if you want to read this book.  First, the "epic" combat action of the platoon lasted less than a day (about 10-12 hours).  The fighting was intense but no more so (probably less so) than many many other units in the european theater.  As to the claim that their actions were pivotal to the American success in (eventually) repulsing the attack, just look at the recollection of the platoon's own members who state that it was only the unbelievable incompetence of the attacking German forces that delayed their eventual capture.  The platoon commander recalls even early in the battle that the superior force (primarily infantry, enemy tanks only show up later after their capture) could have easily flanked them and overwhelmed them at any time, and simply didn't.  The german tank commander interviewed after the war states that it was traffic jams that delayed his column, not the actions of a small platoon.  The book devotes one chapter to the "epic" (brief) battle.  The rest of the book bounces from the platoon members suffering as POWs, and a superficial account of the surviving 99th division combat actions.  Finally, the medals of distinction.  Only one of the medals (for the platoon leutenant) was recommended by the division's chain of command after the war.  All the rest were requested beginning in 1966 in response to that silver star medal.  The commanding leutenant takes on the crusade to have the rest of his soldiers recognized 20+ years after the fact.  Americans are grateful to all those who fought bravely in wwII (indeed all wars), and we can certainly understand the emotional attachment between the platoon commander and his men....but 4 DSCs, 5 silver stars, and 9 bronze stars?  Why not just hand out 18 medals of honor?  When compared to the continued combat bravery of other people/units in wwII, Korea, and Vietnam, this just pales terribly in comparison.  Even members of the platoon thought the medals were questionable:  "Don't call (me) a hero.  Please don't use that word.  Too many other people did a lot more than I did who were never recognized."   I agree.  When we confuse bravery and competence with true individual heroism sufficient to justify our nation's higher honors, we dilute the significance of those who truly performed amazing feats of distinction.  This may sound like more of a critique of the events than the book.  The link is that the book is much less than advertised (in my opinion).  The book is a decent historical account of what happened in this small component of the war.  For that it is a fair read.  If you expect it to impress you with true heroism and incredible combat action, you'd probably be better to look elsewhere.  It was a waste of time for me 
 I have read many of Philip Pullmans other books, so I must say that my expectations for this were high and perhaps that's why I gave it such a low rating.  The whole atmosphere of this book was that of a drugstore mystery, one that is just on the shelf and nobody really buys it. The story is about a guy, Chris, that sees a girl and it is just love at first sight. Usually, if it were written right, this would definitely be a book that I would enjoy. But Philip Pullman just did not pull off what he had in his other books, perhaps it was writers block. One thing about this book is that it does not convince me that Chris and Jennys (the girl Chris loves) are truly in love. There are moments when you think, "Hey, this could be pretty interesting." But it turns out just being a false alarm. Another disappointment is that nothing is really a surprise, I guessed everything that was set up as if it should be a surprise and that totally took away from the book.  All in all, I do not recommend this book but I do recommend Philip Pullmans other books, especially the His Dark Materials series (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass). I suggest finding a better book than this to spend your time reading.

 Please be warned that this book is not based on research, it is based on opinion and personal stories. The dental community takes patient safety and health very seriously and has conducted extensive research into the subject of dental amalgam. There have been NO well conducted studies to support claims against it. In addition, fluoride is one of the great victories of the public health system, significantly decreasing the incidence of dental caries. Of course ANYTHING in too large of a dose, or taken in an improper manner can be a poison including--yes it is true, even water. "The dose makes the poison" For your health and safety, please don't take this book as fact, as it really has no sound basis!  ADA Statement on Dental Amalgam www.ada.org  Dental amalgam (silver filling) is considered a safe, affordable and durable material that has been used to restore the teeth of more than 100 million Americans. It contains a mixture of metals such as silver, copper and tin, in addition to mercury, which chemically binds these components into a hard, stable and safe substance. Dental amalgam has been studied and reviewed extensively, and has established a record of safety and effectiveness.  Issued in late 1997, the FDI World Dental Federation and the World Health Organization consensus statement on dental amalgam stated, "No controlled studies have been published demonstrating systemic adverse effects from amalgam restorations." The document also states that, aside from rare instances of local side effects of allergic reactions, "the small amount of mercury released from amalgam restorations, especially during placement and removal, has not been shown to cause any ... adverse health effects."  The ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs' 1998 report on its review of the recent scientific literature on amalgam states: "The Council concludes that, based on available scientific information, amalgam continues to be a safe and effective restorative material." The Council's report also states, "There currently appears to be no justification for discontinuing the use of dental amalgam."  In an article published in the February 1999 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association, researchers report finding "no significant association of Alzheimer's Disease with the number, surface area or history of having dental amalgam restorations" and "no statistically significant differences in brain mercury levels between subjects with Alzheimer's Disease and control subjects."  The U.S. Public Health Service issued a report in 1993 stating there is no health reason not to use amalgam, except in the extremely rare case of the patient who is allergic to a component of amalgam. This supports the findings of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Conference and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, that dental amalgam is a safe and effective restorative material. In addition, in 1991, Consumer Reports noted, "Given their solid track record . . . amalgam fillings are still your best bet."  In 1991, the FDA's Dental Products Panel found no valid data to demonstrate clinical harm to patients from amalgams or that having them removed would prevent adverse health effects or reverse the course of existing diseases. The FDA's most recent reaffirmation of amalgam's safety was published on December 31, 2002.  The reaffirmation reads, "FDA and other organizations of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) continue to investigate the safety of amalgams used in dental restorations (fillings). However, no valid scientific evidence has ever shown that amalgams cause harm to patients."  It continues, "Also, USPHS scientists analyzed about 175 peer-reviewed studies submitted in support of three citizen petitions received by FDA after the 1993 report. They concluded that data in these studies did not support claims that individuals with dental amalgam restorations will experience problems, including neurologic, renal or developmental effects, except for rare allergic or hypersensitivity reactions."  The U.S. Public Health Service found in 1993 "no persuasive reason to believe that avoiding amalgams or having them removed will have a beneficial effect on health." In fact, it is inadvisable to have amalgams removed unnecessarily because it can cause structural damage to healthy teeth.  The ADA supports ongoing research in the development of new materials that it hopes will someday prove to be as safe and effective as dental amalgam. However, the ADA continues to believe that amalgam is a valuable, viable and safe choice for dental patients and concurs with the findings of the U.S. Public Health Service that amalgam has "continuing value in maintaining oral health."     
 This book is definately mostly about the authors trials and tribulations. It reads kind of awkwardly and clumsy.  I didn't feel that I got to know more about what "actually" went on in the Waco compound on a daily basis. Frankly, it seems to be alot of adolecent "whining" about how hard life is and how much easier it gets when you have a "leader" who makes decisions for you 
 There is no hiss at all on this disc and noise reduction artifacts everywhere. It sounds like a crappy MP3. The strings sound like they were recorded in a vaccum. And the EQ is BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT! The "Flashback" box set, which was done in the US with the original tapes, sounds so much better than this disc, it's not even funny. The liner notes that say "Remastered From The Original Tapes and Artist Approved" will fool a lot of ignorant people, but not me! I want my money back 
  Although it is well produced and shows great potential, The Aerovons sound too much like their heroes, The Beatles; but Beatles lite.   The Fab Five (gotta include George Martin as a Beatle) did have a large umbrella of influence then (and now) on what sounds good, but there are some great examples of musicians taking the Beatles sound and turning it into their own thing without pure emulation.  The Byrds, Emmit Rhodes, Bee Gees are just a few good examples out of the many.  When it comes down to it The Aerovons were still in their teens.  What type of soulfulness could be expected from people with such little life experience???  They did what plenty other teenager would have done under the circumstance and emulate their heroes.  Of the many bands that have come out in the last 30 years that were under 20, only a small handful of them survived and found their own way- but most were appreciated because of who they sounded like and not for a distinct sound of their own- that takes development and to the music industry that is a gamble with their money. Although The Aerovons didn't totally imitate The Beatles, there's very little unique to the melodies and lyrics not to disassociate it from the Beatles.    Perhaps if the Aerovons did have more space to develop they really could have been a great band- Resurrection hints at the potential, but as their peak 
 Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).  But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.  Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.  But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound. 
 My daughter is in [...] and doesn't talk or act like Junie B. Neither do any of the other first graders I know. While some of her comments are funny, for the most part, I find her offensive. My daughter has a really hard time reading and understanding these books because the grammar is so bad and Junie B doesn't have a linear train of thought when she speaks. Try other series like Cam Jansen, the Littles, et 
 In my opinion, none of the episodes captured the best of the Pink Panther series.   
 P.J. O'Rourke, a "fellow" at the Washington-based Cato Institute, sets out to answer the question "why do some places prosper and thrive while others just suck?" The problem with that premise is that... well the premise sucks.  Being based on yardsticks like GDP, GNP, GNR (and potentially the NFL and NHL) the book is fashioned in terms used by contemporary and illegitimate, notions which do not reflect progress, happiness or well-being and instead focus on how much companies can sell you stuff.   Economics is discussed as a passing topic as relates to O'Rourke's observations, but the bulk of the book is a human essay combined with the author's travelogue of places like Moscow, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Albania, Cuba and more. Of course, humour being the front man, the writer duly agrees upfront that the numbers are crap, the facts are a joke, Republicans need a plug or two (as do 'non-partisan' [snort] think-tanks), but the book is hit and miss both philosophically and stylistically. The book asks good questions, but P.J. is not an awfully good writer. The passages veer between funny and plain old boring or sophisticated and akin to someone hollering at a frat part. The naked observations of far-flung places are, perhaps, the best part of the book given the absurdity of the situation. Fathoming and shaping reality in order to lasso intellectual discourse can only go so far however (CNN is an alternate universe).   O'Rourke might like to call Sweden socialist as a put-down, which is all good given that Scandinavian country's untouchable credentials, but last some one checked workers did not own the means of production there. Cuba might have throngs of people standing around doing nothing - isn't that the forte of think-tanks? - yet it would be fun to see how the country would do without American embargoes and overt aggression. A "laissez-faire" attitude towards commerce might have propelled a strategically-located rock called Hong Kong into riches (there is that subjective term, again), but how does the author explain the centrally planned and executed economies of Korea, China, Malaysia, Singapore or Dubai which have recently outpaced beacons of capitalism like America and Haiti? To criticize the use of Mandarin by Chinese officials in Hong Kong makes sense until, only a second later, one notices that the use of English is even more absurd and foreign there.   Stick with the one about the skeleton in the bar next time, P.J 
 When I first heard Nickelback about 7 or 8 years ago (The State), I thought they were decent, nothing great, but decent.  I still think The State is an OK disc.  But like most bands, once they sell out and find fame, the quality of the product goes down the tubes.  Besides being musically bland, and never changing...the lyrics are just about as deep as a rain puddle after a drizzle.  "Figured you out" has to be the worst...any 8th grade dropout could write that, its just plain dumb, as well as vulgar.  
 I love Bill Hicks.  I own every available CD of the man's work.  Listening to Mr. Hicks' concerts motivated me to read two books about the man.  His intellect and material far outshine that of George Carlin and Lewis Black.  Oh, if only he had lived long enough -- he died in 1994 of pancreatic cancer -- to decapitate George W. Bush with his rapier-like wit! (He was no friend of George H. W. Bush, often referring to him as "...a child of satan...")  That said...  This DVD isn't very good.  It looks and sounds as though it had been dubbed from a ratty VHS bootleg.  The contained material is prime Hicks, but the same material is available on the much-better "Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian," DVD.  "Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian," contains three concerts.  Those concerts ("One Night Stand," "Relentless," and "Revelations,") are preserved here in pristine condition.  In addition to the concerts, a documentary on Hicks, "Just a Ride," is also included 
 This book is a crock.  It is full of fallacies that the author presents as "truth" to those who don't know any better.  Granted, the "master cleanser diet" might very well work (I've decided against it) and the author is fairly up-front of the negative effects one will likely experience.  But the explanations and claims this book makes are ridiculous.  The author claims that there are no such thing as disease-causing bacteria and viruses.  Also, he claims that the lack of protein in this diet is not a problem because your body will assimilate nitrogen and carbon from the air you breathe into the components of protein.  Take an introductory biology class, Stanley Burroughs, before you make such laughable claims.  
 This book is awful.  It doesn't discuss the issues of Configuration management, it isn't a how-to book.  It is a collection of disjoint material and results that would appeal to no one, or at least I have no idea who the target audience is.  I bought this online and would not have purchased it at all if I had flipped through the pages in a bookstore first 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were "cruel" to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel 
 Although I paid extra for shipping, this item took 2 weeks to arrive. I am very unhappy with Amazon's service. This has not been my experience with Amazon in the past. What has changed 
 Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.  Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.    Dumped mine a month after I got it 
 My son is a big Spiderman fan and so I ordered this new Animated Series.  He told me upon viewing it, that this was computer-animated.  I think it stinks and if I had known this before I opened it, I would have returned it and got my money back!!! Give me the old animation any day 
 Most of the other reviews have said it well, this book is a total waste of time and I wouldn't have told my wife to get this for me for x-mas had I seen who the "authors" were (I was basing my want for the book based on the title which sounded like it could have been very cool) Most of the "myths" aren't, has some very bad, inacurate and distorted facts, poor writing,  I could go on and on---I think the only reason I even finished it (mostly when taking a crap) is for the laughs I got on how stupid and ludicrous it was---If I could give this a negative star I would, in fact it pisses me off that I have to give this 1 star ---don't buy any Beatle book by these "authors"  they all stink 
 I've read ST Novels by Friedman before and liked a lot of them. I ordered this book and couldn't wait to read it. I was so disappointed. The best thing about this book is the title. If you must read it - get it from your local library or find a cheap used copy. 
 I got a lot of use out of this toaster oven for the first 2 1/2 years. It toasts fairly evenly, the broiler works well, and the controls are easy.  Unfortunately, a problem started about 3 weeks ago. The toast setting would click off after just a few seconds, making it impossible to toast anything. Today I turned on the oven, and the wiring inside the controls started to smoke. I unplugged it immediately and now have to replace the whole unit.   I would not recommend this oven. Internal wiring should not burn under normal use, especially after just a few years.  
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 Oxford's earlier paperback of this title had larger type, larger page size, better pictures. I had expected the same book. Now I think the hardbound is a much better buy 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 Director:  Douglas Cheek Cast:  John Heard, Daniel Stern, Christopher Curry, Kim Greist, Laure Mattos, Brenda Currin, Justin Hall, Michael O'Hare, Cordis Heard. Running Time:  88 minutes Rated R for language, violence, and gore.  One of the opening images in the supremely cliched "C.H.U.D"  (which stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) is a full-on shot of a truck banner reading "Slow Moving Vehicle." That's the most valid image in the whole film. Under Manhattan, mysterious creatures terrorize the homeless who live in the sewers, and begin striking those who walk the streets as well. When one disappearance involves a precinct captain's wife, the captain starts investigating the situation by asking around a neighborhood soup kitchen.  The captain, Bosch, is played by Christopher Curry, a here-and-gone Martin Mull lookalike whose casual handling of his wife's disappearance would come off as absurd if we hadn't previously gotten a load of what she looks like. While Curry is the main actor, two better-known names have key supporting roles, Daniel Stern as the grimy soup kitchen director (only the destitute would accept a meal from him) and John Heard as a photographer.  Heard's character has little to do with the story, and the way he's brought in is lazy and forced. He has some photos of streetpeople, and one homeless woman calls him for bail. He takes a photo of a gored leg that shows something sinister is going on, though all I saw was bad make-up. Through most of the film, we see him blow off deadlines and interact unaffectionately with his live-in girlfriend, played by Kim Griest. Heard here is smug and charmless, wasting away as "C.H.U.D." decomposes before the very eyes of the audience.  Sewer creatures rising up in the big city is not a bad concept, but not only does the film fail to do anything with it, the audience get a lot of inert moments where people trade clich-ridden dialogue and ridiculous characterization.  There's a stonewalling government official played by George Martin who bulges his eyes and sneers at every question and gives us an obvious central villain since the budget is too cheap to show us much of the monsters. The creatures are meant to horrify but merely look like inept Halloween window displays, while the unbearable synthesized score sounds like a seven-year-old toying with a department-store display organ.  The whole movie is like that, jumping from effect to effect, hitting us with little shock moments here and there, not tying anything in. This is not scary, just annoying. "C.H.U.D" gets mentioned as an askew satire, but just isn't in the same class as "Tremors" or "Return of the Living Dead," let alone an "Evil Dead film".  To recite another clich: You have been warned. 
 I really cannot understand why this book has earned its acclaimed classic status.  It has little beyond the usual tired trading psychology:  - don't bet all your capital in one idea; - cut your losses; - follow the trend while it's good.  That's all - seriously, who still has not known about all these points, and for free?  Most of the interviews have not delved deep enough into how these traders analyze a trading idea, what frame work they use, why system, what data source they follow etc.  Most of the time, I have to conclude that they did it by pure luck.   Here is an example.  "... I had a plan.  I would wait until the market moved up to a certain level and then retracted by a specified amount before adding another unit..."  How did he come up with the level?  And why specified amount??  It reads terribly like he just got it off the charts!!!  Let's face it.  If I am a big, profitable trader who is still making money off my supposedly ingenius trading system, would I want to publish it in a book and share it with the rest of the world?  There you have it.  I would not want to waste your time or mine any more on this grossly over-rated book 
 No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would.  Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?  School and Society, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.  90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. The School and Society relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one 
 People ordering this should know that Skye, the singer of the past Morcheeba albums, is not on this record.  The two men who started the band got a new singer, who just isn't as special, and now the band sounds like a lot of other bands (unfortunately).  With Skye gone they just don't stand out from the rest.  :- 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I am surprised to see so many people think highly of this book. I have a startup for a new software product and am trying to bootstrap (to raise VC money you still need paying clients). I read this book some months back and was disappointed. Two false things stuck out even now:  1) dont prototype, pre-sell your idea. This may work for service type companies, but may not work for products. Why? as you build the prototype, you will innovate and the end product will be unrecognizable from the idea at the start. This was my case. I had to build my prototype. The customer doesnt know what he wants until it is laid out in front of him.  2) exploit your employees. He didnt say it explicitly or would have been sued for age discrimination, but he says, hire people without much experience, and full of energy ie. young. Then make them work long hours for cheap. I have seen a big name (top three) consulting company deliberately do this strategy and burn their people out. Sorry, that is not how I plan to build my business!  The best book for startups is Kawasaki's "Art of the Start". Skip this book 
 Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories.  I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing.  It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of "lecturing" about various and sundry things.  Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books. 
 I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [... 
 More regurgitated destructive orthodoxy from the arid soul of an academic hack, it's all here every careerist leftist's cliche there is.  The arrogance of the previous reviewer could only come from a button down Yalie politically correct snob 
 This book is extremely confusing and has too much distracting information.  It's sad that many schools use this as their text on physics.  There is little to no math in this book to assist you, yet the review sections expect you to know the math to do the work.  How is that possible?  Terrible book 
 The lyrics to the title track sound like they were written by a 2nd grader. "When the sun goes down we'll be movin'/When the sun goes down we'll be groovin/When the sun goes down feelin' all right/Everything is hotter when the sun goes down."  It almost makes "Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong" seem intelligent.  
 This item was fun for my daughter to build with her grandpa, but after it was built the fun was over. It doesn't do much except sit on the shelf and take up space. I told her to take it apart again and redo it. That might be fun once, but after that it will probably go to the Thrift Shop 
 It took me about 30 minutes to read through this book and glean whatever original material the author had to offer. The most useful bit of "practical" advice I found was to use post-it notes stuck inside of a manila folder for organizing web page topics. Somehow I expected more from a book with "Information Architecture" in the title. This is a light-weight book, possibly for someone who has had little or no exposure to the web. It is more about corporate project management than website structure. The architecture of the book itself is disorganized and confusing; it rambles for seven chapters on various disparate topics before launching into the purported subject of the book, and even then it amounts pretty much to restating fairly obvious, common-sense techniques 
 One shouldn't have to empty water out after every use.  One shouldn't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice.  That is not a functional teapot, if that may be the case.  Though it is the prettiest teapot around, it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while.  Le Creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime, but the enamelware can't even touch the quality of the cast-iron cookware.  Fortunately, the company stands by its products and I am sending mine back for a replacement.  See www.lecreuset.com for details.. 
 I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players.  An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants.  Hearing about a bunch of middle aged and old guys sitting around eating chow mein and idolizing Red is not very entertaining.    I have no doubt that all of Red's adventures in the NBA would make a fantastic book.  Unfortunately, this is not that book. 
 This book was difficult to read in my opinion because it inched along in Wealthy Barber fashion. Some people like that, but I don't. You had to read about detailed mall conversations with fictitious people for a page before you get to the part about budgeting. Ultimately, the book does not address what to do with the complex issues of envelope budgeting such as a single Walmart purchase of clothing, food, toys, and cleaning supplies. Do you haul out four envelopes and make change? How do you carry large amounts of cash safely? All the "how to's" conclude with a suggestion to do the envelopes with software, i.e., the disk included with the book. This is nothing more than a software sales pitch, and it gets worse.  In order to use your 30 day trial of the disk included in the book, you must ante up your credit card number and agree to pay the a monthly fee if you forget to cancel. You cannot access the software without signing up for this service. I got taken. You don't have to 
 This book truely does not help much.  The problems at the end of the chapters do not have any answers in the back of the book, as do all others.  It is impossible to check your work until it is too late.  This book does not build from simpler to more complex.  It does the opposite, which only prolongs the learning process and makes it more difficult than it could be 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 This CD is disappointing.  It doesn't even sound like Kenny! 
 You only need to read the book by Whitley Strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is.  
         This book does present mostly what Mormons believe.    However, it does not clearly present or emphasize the distinctive and gross differences between our real God and Creator, and Jesus Christ as revealed by the Bible and the distorted Mormon view.    It is the Bible, not the BOM, D&C, or POGP that truthfully and accurately reveals to us who is God our Creator.    This book is clearly misleading and having Mouw write the forward shows its true intend,  which is to compromise God's truth to appease the Mormon the deception.    False doctrine is a lie and presenting it is such an appealing light only adds to the deception 
 Earthquake: Nature Unleashed (Tibor Takacs, 2004)  Ah, Tibor Takacs, the man who has me half-convinced that the Sci-Fi Channel really does commission its original films rather than picking up things that couldn't get distributed any other way. The plot, for what it is: a series of earthquakes warns, then strikes, a Russian nuclear plant. The warnings are, of course, ignored by the head of the plant, who presses on at the behest of the greedy American company trying to get the thing online while not straying too far over budget. Of course, to pound in the message, the representative of said company and its safety consultant used to be married, and they have two kids who are in danger because the plant's core might melt down and any second and wipe Russia off the map.  That you can possibly ask "why should we care?" at such a premise is the mark of a truly bad movie, and that's exactly what you'll find yourself asking numerous times here. The script is atrocious, the acting even more so (including one actor who comes off so wooden it's impossible to figure out whether he's supposed to be playing a Russian trying to speak English-- without a trace of an accent, mind you-- or an American who's simply a really bad actor. Either way, the effect is hilarious). The plot is horribly thin, far too much so to hold this mess together. Avoid at all costs. (zero 
 I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow.  I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline.  There's no depth of character in any of the main figures.  The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal.  If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it 
 I saw him live in 1987 when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short (only 45 minutes) and only had a couple of good routines.  My hopes were higher than what this delivered!  The bonus material was taken from Vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny.  I would recommend looking at another DVD of his rather than purhcase this one 
 Writers who are insightful and entertaining elsewhere, like Virginia Heffernan and Nick Hornsby, are dull and pointless here.  Susan Cheever gives us yet another picture of her famous father as a stuffy suburban drunk.  Nora Ephron likes Mary Tyler Moore because it made her feel better about being a single woman.  So what?  "Why did you like Gilligan's Island" is not an inherently interesting question- quite the opposite.  It would take  real talent to make something nourishing out of these bones.  And, although the resumes of these writers indicated that the necessary talent had been assembled, the product demonstrated otherwis 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 I think that some of the textual work, such as that on Hosea 4:15 and 8:2 is odd. It goes to some lengths to keep the text together. In upholding the integrity of the text, the commentary does some problematic things to it 
 In all seriousness Avery Cardoza couldn't have spent more then 5 hours putting this book together in it's entirety.  The chief ill of this book is that it takes on too broad of a scope in covering the major forms of poker (Hold'Em, Seven card Stud, Lowball, Draw, etc) but then serves further insult by providing only a cursory explaination of rules for these poker variations with no inclusion of specific play strategy for each of them.  The other information (winning strategy, money management, etc.) is completely generic and skimpy in weight.  Do yourself a favour and fold this weak hand before the flop 
 The sound is not innovative - it's pretentious.  The sound is not new - it's been done before, and done better.  I gave this disc many spins, hoping that my ears would start appreciating what other reviewers have said, but it just didn't happen.  I found it totally undigestable, and if this is what is supposed to be the new direction of music, then I'll stick with the old.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy the cd based on all the glowing reviews here...listen to it first.  I wish I would have listened to it before I bought it - now I'm going to sell my copy on Amazon...and there aren't very many cds I sell due to disliking them.  
 I'm a pretty untiring reader, as long as I have faith I'm in competent hands, but I gave this book up at page 160, which was enough of an investment to convince me that Porter was lost, lost, lost.  I'm an admirer of her short stories, but all she's done in this larger form is expand the cast of characters, forgetting to give them anything to do.  The characters are really only cartoons, which Porter seems aware of, since she doggedly gives us paragraphs and pages of analysis for most of them.  But in a novel, characters define themselves by what they do, not by what they think about themselves, or what their creator thinks of them.  The sheer number of them just hanging around listlessly becomes so unwieldly for Porter that you feel sorry for her -- you can almost hear her thinking, "Wait, what about So-and-so, we haven't seen him come out of him cabin lately, maybe I'll have him get drunk and make a scene.&quot 
 Well, this book is filled with lots of interesting stories, but it's so disorganized it seems like it was written by an Jazz age drunk!  Better editing would have done wonders for this book which has great stories about some of the celebrities of the 1920's, but flows sloppily from one anecdote to another 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 I learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets.  Obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that doesn't make my opinion any less valid.  It is, after all, my honest opinion, and therefore it is worth something to someone, if only to me.  Sometimes I agree with Ebert, and sometimes i completely disagree with him.  I think we all believe in our hearts that "I" am the only one with the correct opinion.  I would subscribe to that myself.  This movie is PAINFULLY slow and boring.  Wim Wenders, next time maybe you will develop a story line, please, huh?  I really hate the premise that the only way an angel's life can be fulfilling is if he becomes human.  That is the moral here and also in the annoying movie City of Angels.  That's absurd.  Assuming that there is life after death, assuming that there are angels, and I in no way discount that possibility because I know how little we truly know, it is absurd to think that the angels have nothing to do but watch over us and wish they were with us.  That is offensively stupid and self centered.  It is like a child's point of view that mommy and daddy have absolutely nothing to do and are bored to tears when they are not watching the baby and coloring in the baby's coloring book.  So this conception of angels is, in my not at all humble opinion, stupid and offensive.  What makes you think that we humans are the center of the universe and the only worthwhile thing that is going on, dingbat?  Stupid premise, and boring story, if you want to call it a story at all.  I can't keep watching it.  It is still on right now, and I'm writing this review to relieve the boredom.  Later - After seeing the end of the movie, I must add that the final monologue committed by the angel's human girlfriend is probably the worst monologue I have ever seen on film.  She goes on and on, saying nothing, in a stupid and self indulgent elongated bit of nonsense that is surreal, meaningless, and stupid.  The only thing that this movie has going for it is that it makes people appreciate simple things about life, like warming your hands together on a cold day.  That's a nice and worthwhile thought, to appreciate the very little and insignificant things about life.  Aside from that bit of wisdom, this movie is poor, boring, full of itself, aimless, and overrated 
 Can we say Drukqs? Or better yet....John Cage? I'm sick of this new thing in IDM, "do some cool avant garde Cage piano songs. " How original! Can anyone invent some new ideas? Want some real electronic music? Check out some artists on Tigerbeat6 and Audio Dregs. 
 Pieper has a lot of practical knowledge but some things he writes are plain wrong.  On page 17 he writes: "The frequency of the sine wave is measured as Hz per second" (should be cycles per second which is Hz).  On page 18 he says: "the sine wave [is] 220 volts between two peaks" (should be 311 v; 220 is the RMS voltage).  On page 23 he says: "amp hours [are] also refered to as amps per hour or amp/hours" (not true).  In page 27 he writes: "At some point, the resistance gets so high that it creates heat inside the conductor" (there is always resistance and heat, the problem is the temperature rises too high).  He also is convinced the minerals in petroleum jelly help conductivity on the battery terminals (pp. 123&159) and says "search current" when he means "surge current" (pp. 120&125).  Whole pages are such confusing technical nonsense that it is impossible to to give a short account.  He self published - he should have had a technically competent person help him with theory and a good how-to book editor help with the practical stuff.  I'm sure he is a very competent electrician and there is some good practical information in the book, but it is nowhere near as advertised 
 Anyone with any life experience, and, especially, business experience and savy would know 90% of this stuff. Anyone who isn't already aware of it shouldn't be thinking about starting a business in the first place. The list of resources is of some value, so I didn't give it one star 
 I had just read A Year in the Merde and loved it. My husband and I go to France very year, love everything about it, especially the differences between the U.S. and France. So many of the customs are unexplainable to us, one being that whenever we go to anyplace in France, we expect it to be closed.  The hours the stores keep I cannot figure out, and the hours of the restaurants vary also. We see a sign that says(in French) open all the days, we go the next day and the place is FERME(closed). A Year in the Merde points out so many differences, I just laughed and laughed, as none are serious, just something you must deal with.   We were told that 60 Million Frenchmen was also a very funny book. It is not. Not one bit. Do not buy it if you are looking for something light. 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible 
 All the reviews so far sound like personal friends of B.W. who are puffing the book. The book is simple and would require more information. So why not just go buy a book with more information. 
 This was Jule Styne's first "book" musical comedy for Broadway and it is mediocre in the extreme - with the notable exception of three numbers (Bye Bye Baby, A Little Girl From Little Rock and Diamonds Are A  Girl's Best Friend - the latter two  rendered by debuting comedienne Carol  Channing.)  These three numbers and Channing's now classic renditions of  the latter two are the ONLY reason for purchasing this album.   The songs  do not relate to the plot or characters and they are as forgettable as  Channing is not.  The original 14 78-rpm sides have been sonically  restored, but there's nothing to enjoy here except Carol 
 I've read this book about 2 years ago so I can't really get into the details. It's pretty good but  I think a much better book is called "The Self Esteem Workbook" by Schiraldi which I would definitely recommend over this one. Also Self-Esteem by Channing is another good one but more complicated 
 Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big "so what". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts 
 To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free.  These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money 
 This is a black & white edition: it does NOT include the color plates of older editions.  Without color, it is impossible to appreciate the formulations of the thought-forms.  Buy an older edition instead 
 "Blind Alley" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!   I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! "Blind Alley" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!   A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.   As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.   It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the "yuk" meter!   There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!   I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!

 Broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars.  Wouldn't recommend 
 Richard Dawkins is a world-class evolutionary biologist and one of the best popular science writers working today.  His "The Blind Watchmaker" is, I think, the best layman's book on natural selection ever written; I re-read it every few years just to enjoy the clarity of his style.  "A Devil's Chaplain," then, is a book I really wanted to like.  I understood walking out of the bookstore that "Chaplain" would not, in the main, be about evolutionary biology.  And I have seen enough examples of scientists -- brilliant within their own areas of expertise -- who write commonplaces or even twaddle when off their home turf.  That caution did not prepare me for the spectacle of Dawkins's plunge into unselfconscious dogmatism and graceless bile in large sections of this book.  Portions of "A Devil's Chaplain" dealing with evolutionary biology are quite good.  Sections dealing with "memes" are less satisfactory.  I actually finished Dawkins's first essay on memes _less_ convinced that they are a viable analog to genes than when I went in.  In particular, Dawkins's  postlog on why science is not a meme was unconvincing, weak argumentation at best, hand-waving at worst.  Dawkins's opinions on social institutions and politics recall William F. Buckley's  quip that it would be preferable to be ruled by citizens drawn randomly from the Boston telephone book than by the members of Harvard's faculty.  Dawkins's disparagement of the concept of trial by jury (in favor of `more rational' trial by judge) misses the point of that institution in a particularly elephantine way.  His viewpoint is elitist in a distinctively cozy, English, university-don manner.  Dawkins seems so nauseated at the thought that some gaggle of dimwitted proles might sit in judgement of _him_ that he is oblivious to the notion that an individual judge -- albeit a credentialed professional and Dr. D's intellectual equal (more or less) -- might treat him unfairly.  And some of the notions Dawkins advances are just loopy.  For instance, at one point he imagines being in the presence of a genetically-engineered approximation of an australopithecene and "tearfully taking her hand in mine" -- as if the hominid in question were an actual australopithecene, not a laboratory-made chimera, and as if the poor creature were capable of understanding his emotion, let alone reciprocating it.  "A Devil's Chaplain" is an instant classic, but not of any sort that Richard Dawkins could have intended.  With it, he joins the list of brilliant specialists who missed their opportunity to leave intact the assumption that they were sages in a broad way, instead of solely in their fields of specialization 
 Well here we have it - a book AGAINST the age of progress. This guy is FOR keeping PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. This guy is FOR KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPTUTATED. This is guy is for KEEPING DEPRESSED SUICIDAL PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Its because of this attitude that neoluddites like this cannot win 
 Do yourself a favor. Don't get this film. There's nothing you haven't seen before a million times. And done better too. I was completely disappointed. No scares to be found. Get Darkness Falls instead. 
 I was expecting a lot more from this film. Besides some spectacular views of the mountain, it left me feeling empty and wanting more. I was hoping for more actual information about climbing Kili and what it was really like and I was disappointed when there was little or none. Despite their words saying how hard it was, the film did not capture the feeling of how challenging it is. I came across as little more than a simple hike. Pretty pictures but lacking substance. Breashears' Everest is significantly better and more interesting 
    I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY and it was in a very few instances.      Overall, I was disappointed and glad it was a short read 
 Of the thousands of pages read preparing for one certification for another --- this is the worst book I have come across.  Frankly I am so disapointed I may well not purchase another book from this publisher.  I am half way throught the 2nd section.  I see no reason to continue.. 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 I know too little to critique this book - a book is like a painting as we turn the pages the picture gets brighter and brighter. Most of the time the picture is incomplete and then it is our job to imagine the completion. In this canvas there are the back ground colors (in musical terms these are noises) and there are the primary characters over that background. It is important that the artiste do not mix up too much of the back ground with the primary focuses. In this book the back ground overpowers the focused characters.  We use examples to reinforce our ideas and thought and not to divert the actual discussion - in all the five stories the examples fudge the primary discussions. I never question the fact that Edmund Wilson is extremely knowledgeable but that does not mean I have to get a dose of that in every page. Hemingway's book "the old man and the sea" is not thick and there are no examples but it still captures our imagination while these five stories do not. May be this book was not for me - my recommendation is try one story and then plan for the rest of the book. 
 When I learned from Kevin DuBrow's web site that Quiet Riot had a new CD, I was excited!  To put it in perspective, I was a high school Freshman when "Metal Health" was released and saw QR on that tour.  Twenty-plus years later, MH is still one of my all-time favorite albums.  It took me four stops to finally track down "Rehab."  Apparently, most music stores only stock what they believe consumers like and will actually buy.  Go figure.  But FYE had it for a mere $9.99.  (In retrospect, I wish I hadn't parted with my Alexander Hamilton.)  My kids were in the car when I played this CD for the first time.  I'm not sure if I was more embarrassed having them think that I once liked this band, or if I was more embarrassed for DuBrow, Banali & Company for recording it.  (Maybe I was embarrassed for Glenn Hughes crediting himself as part of the project.  He should have considered using Alan Smithee as a pseudonym.)  QR peaked early with MH and has been sliding downhill since "Condition Critical."  Tragically, this CD follows that same trajectory.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, on this CD is worth writing about.  I'll usually listen to a CD that doesn't impress me a couple of times to see if it grows on me, but the first time through with "Rehab" was painful and the second time was simply boring.  There are no hot guitar licks, the vocals are tired, the songs loose, I think there are bass lines (but can't be certain), and the drumming lacks creativity and passion.  And no one will confuse the lyrics as something perhaps penned by either Lennon or Townshend.  I hope Kevin and Frankie invested well earlier in their career and don't need to tour to support this one.  The one highlight for "Rehab" was the picture on the inside the jacket of Kevin DuBrow with Frankie Banali.  Kevin now has hair (plugs?  Rogaine??) and it's dyed blond.  Apparently, he's going for the Carlos Cavazo look of 23 years ago.  Again, embarrassing (but humorous!).  It's like looking at a 50 y.o. woman who wears hotpants and still thinks she's got "it": kind of gross and twisted, but kind of funny in a mockingly way.  I bought this CD in part as a novelty and in part out of nostalgia.  The reality is, it's a freak show.  Simply, embarrassing 
 I would like to add my support to the general statements that the reviewer Constance Edwards made and add a few of my own.    To begin, I am an atheist and pursuing degrees in history and philosophy.  What is unfortunate about Erickson's book is that a well meaning idea of documenting the negative aspects of the church (of which there are many), is overhshadowed by a complete lack of scholarship (You know you're in trouble when the author uses as one of his primary resources a book of quotations!).    The book also continues to propagate ideas that are just plain false.  Consider the idea that people of the middle ages believed the earth was flat.  Anyone who has taken a college course in the History of Science, or Medieval History will have this illusion dispelled almost immediately (by reading modern scholarship and the original primary source material -- both things that Erickson does not do).  Throughout the book he appears to quote someone, yet, when you look into his notes to discover where he got his information, you discover that (when it is not from George Seldes book of quotations), it is a secondary source, and many of these are from other atheist-friendly books.  Erickson states at the beginning of the book that he is attempting to counter other pro-Christian books, which is admirable and needed.  Unfortunately, he falls into the same trap that he accuses many of his opponents of: a highly biased viewpoint using only sources that back up his view.  And in Erickson's case, this is compounded by poor scholarship and an absence of primary source material.  If you are looking for a history of the relationship between science and the church, please look elsewhere 
 Do not be tricked into buying an "easy" sharpener. They DO NOT work. Spend the same money (or less!) on a good stone set that has various angles (i.e. Lansky, w/ 17, 20, 25, and 30 degree angles, and 3-5 stones: use 20 degrees for your "slicing" and paring knives, and 25 degrees for you chefs). I opted for the stone set (I'm a bit of a purist), but I've heard good remarks about the diamond set, too; the 3 grit set is all you really need: coarse, medium, and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such.  With proper care, and light steel use (it's the re-aligning tool, not the sharpening device - be gentle), you'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two, depending on the work load you put on your knife. But, if you do seriously muck the edge up, you'll have a system that can repair your knife to "good as new" condition.  My chef fell onto the tile floor, point first, and I had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later. The normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade.  And, at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened, you'll be ahead of the game after the first use!  Hint: use a 5X+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source, you'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened. You can also take a look at your edge before using the steel, and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it, then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel. And, see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - I admit I have a couple, myself.  In short: get stoned, not taken 
 Can we say, "money making ploy?"  WoW.  I, like many others, have grown up with Disney.  Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs?  This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o( 
 This book was fairly well-written, I found it readable and didn't find any glaring errors. That said, I found next to nothing on these subjects:  - Natural or organic hair care products - Styling your own hair - Braiding  - Updos - Long hair: care, concerns, special needs or special warnings - Identifying quality implements and caring for implements - Uses of hair accessories you may not be familiar with (eg rats, hair sticks, etc.)  There was a lot of very basic and general information on many subjects including hair loss, alopecia, etc., and it is a good general sourcebook. However if you are looking for in-depth, or even just detailed, treatments of your areas of interest, look elsewhere. I returned this book after reading it through very gently 
 Many errors in trading card section. Plus no mention what-so-ever of x-rated #207 card and also no mention of any Heritage card 
 If you have even spent a little time in your life reading newspapers, magazines, the net, etc you will have seen 99% of these trivia lists and items.  Save your money so you can buy a better quality toilet paper 
 As usual, NT Wright has missed the Correct Answer in his quest to shore up the fading structure of Christianity.  In the Publisher's comment: "the early Christians' belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions."  In Judaism of the first century, there were many Resurrection cults.  The Pharisees believed in angels, demonic spirits and resurrection of the dead.    Again:  "How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians' answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead. No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation."  Sorry, but we HAVE come up with a more convincing explanation.  The Resurrection cults were looking for new victims.  When they heard about Jesus, they started telling people that "Yes, we saw the resurrected Jesus."  Because they were dishonest, even dangerous cults recruiting victims... I mean, members.    It's the kind of lie that a Resurrection cult would invent.  Even Paul said that Jesus was only the first-fruits of an imminent General Resurrection in 1 corinthians 15.  If Mr. Wright would stop trying to con us, he would have to admit that a LIE is simply a more convincing and believable explanation for the resurrection appearances of Jesus.  
 Here is a synopsis of the book so you may spend your money elsewhere:  1) Don't diet 2) Get used to your "new" menopausal figure--ie. learn to love it. 3) Exercise 4 times a week for at least an hour so you feel better--but don't expect miracles in the weight-loss department. Well. duh!  I really felt the book rambled on about the obvious and in the end, I just ended up feeling depressed.  What the book did manage to do was to thoroughly explain the biological process of why your body is changing.  That, I already knew!  
 Ann, an aspiring writer, knew of Lucy, an aspiring poet, when the two of them were students at the same college.  Actually, everyone knew of Lucy.  She was the one who'd had cancer as a child and whose chemotherapy treatments had left her with a severely disfigured face that continued to need surgery after surgery until the end of her life.  Lucy was mistreated by her peers when she was a child, but it seemed that for the rest of her life everyone was trying to make up for that cruelty.  She was cheered for and spoken to warmly wherever she went, despite the fact that she seemed to have few redeeming qualities that would make her so popular.  Even Ann admits that she followed the gossip about Lucy's medical condition and she felt close to her even when Lucy had no idea who Ann was.  Ann couldn't be more delighted when Lucy decides to move in with her after college.  She continues to be thrilled and grateful for the rest of Lucy's life, as Lucy drifts through existence, needing constant reassurance that people loved her, that she was beautiful and talented.  She also needs money, and someone to clean her apartment, and someone to do her bidding after her surgeries.  That person is always Ann, who seems to simply accept that this is the way their relationship should be.  I was confused.  How could an intelligent, educated person allow herself to be treated so poorly?  What was Ann getting out of this relationship that I couldn't see?  Or was it simply that she befriended someone prone to depression and suicide attempts, so she felt she couldn't drop Lucy without putting her life in danger?  Ann is a much better friend than I could ever imagine being; I would have stopped speaking to Lucy after about the fiftieth page 
 I bought Bead Fantasies and Bead Fantasies II at the same time after reading the positive reviews; I wish I had looked at them before buying. There are pretty motifs that I will incorporate into my beading projects but I find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. I'm glad this isn't my first beading book or I would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. I won't be buying Bead Fantasies III.  The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving and Coraling Technique remain my favorite beading books.  
 I am really not able to understand what is this cheap kind of strategy not to provide USB cable with this product, especially when thats the only interface available technically? Can someone make me understand the logic (business sense) behind this, especially for a Canon like brand!!??? Definitely, consumers expect much better from Canon. "Canon", please bring better business sense to market that would help end users/consumers. Thanks 
 Let's face it folks, this book was already outdated when it came out in 1999 and today it's even worse.  The book *does* provide a good high-level discussion of how this stuff works (like you'd expect from an MIT prof), highly recommended for the utter novice.  For everyone else, I'd pass until we see an updated version with less Microsoft bashing and even less demagoguery.  But if you want a good history lesson, go for it 
 Feisal Abdul Rauf is an honest and decent man who sincerely believes what he writes. He has an excellent reputation, well deserved.  Having said that, I must now address what he has written.  Part of the book's title is, "A New Vision for Muslims and the West." Unfortunately, that's all it is, a vision, a fairy tale told to those who want to believe it.  The dark and sinister forces who are radical Islamists will have none of it, and if we are lulled into complacency, the events of 9/11 will become repeated events.  Like it or not, the hardliner Islamists are at war with the West, where the objective is total world conquest, where everyone either becomes a Muslim or he dies (the exceptions being Jews and Christians who, as People of the Book, will be treated as second class citizens).  What Raef refuses to acknowledge is that there are earlier verses in the Qur'an that _do_ preach peace and tolerance....but their are the later verses calling for subjugation and death to the infidel. Islamic scholars have decided that the later verses abrogate (trump) the earlier ones.  For this reason, in my opinion, the book misleads and is fatally flawed 
 I see that Freeman & Hackman are executive producers on this stinker. Just reaffirms, I guess, that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves. The truth in spades in this case.   I think, as I'm sure millions do, that Freeman & Hackman are the very best around, but I've never seen them work with such stiff, stilted pathetically sensationalistic material. On top of which Hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like Ben Kingsley.  Why oh why didn't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to Kenneth Branagh to direct them in a dream version of Othello 
 Nothing in the on-line description of the book nor on the flaps can prepare the reader for this mishmash of 19th century prose and repetions in what is actually a series of lectures delivered ???  There are no dates, or explanations for the writing in these verbose, boring lessons 
 After searching for months for a lesbian novel told in the third person, i was really excited to find Venus Envy.  I am currently on chapter 22 and I think i'll stop here.  I didn't like hte beginning, I haven't liked the progression into the middle and after reading these reviews, I think i'll jsut skip the end.  I read Brown's Ruby Fruit Jungle and i had really loved it.  Despite some far-fetched plot points, I was able to suspend my belief and give her the benefit of the doubt, but this one.. it just doesn't work.  I blame the dialogue.  It's really awful. But not that the rest of it is helping much.  It feels as if the author let the plot dictate the novel and not the characters and that just makes for bad writing.  I'd go for other Brown books, but just not this one 
 I love Alice, and I love low-budget works full of heart, but this production was so relentlessly mediocre that I just couldn't bear to finish it. The songs are lifeless and as poorly paced as the rest of the performance, and the script lacks any spirit; overall this production adds nothing new to the story, yet fails to convey the charm of the book (or, for that matter, nearly any other production I've seen). As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD itself is unimpressive - the chapters are, as near as I could tell, either random or simply timed, without regard to content. If this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood, it may be worth something (unless the DVD transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me); if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere. 
 I have a hard time understanding how one of the other reviewers believes this book hits the "bullseye". As a former employee of one of the agencies listed within this book I had numerous clients come into my office looking for "free money".  They grew very angry and upset once I explained that the "free money" detailed in the book was to fund our agency. The money was not available directly to individuals.  I have written business plans and grant proposals and done research on various industries.  Rarely is there "free money".  The only exception I have seen is in agriculture and rural development.. and it's not just handed out.  The grant process can be long and very time consuming... but well worth it depending on the project 
 There is a subgenre of travel writing in which a sheltered, white kid from a middle class background travels to a foreign country, usually as a volunteer, and goes through a predictable set of phases. It starts with loneliness and despair, laments of the "what am I doing here?" variety; then a sudden awakening to the opportunity to experience a completely different culture; the realization of the changes the experience has wrought on the author; and then either the sadness at having to depart or going native.   The books are full of stories meant to illustrate the cultural differences that are almost like mad-libs, you just fill in the blanks: In America we [do something] but here in [insert country here] they [do something else]! Isn't that wacky! It's intensely annoying and usually more about the author than about the author's experiences. Jamie Zeppa's "Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey into Bhutan" is not just an example of that type of book, it stretches the style to the nth degree.  She's a Canadian girl who took a job teaching in Bhutan, an exotic and mysterious destionation even amongst travellers. But she seems strangely uninterested in her surroundings. A three-hour hike is torture to her. She visits the capital cities and her fellow volunteers ... and that's about it. She's done a little reading but makes little effort to learn the country by exploring on her own.  Apparently she's oblivious to the way she portrays herself. She's not likeable or credible as an observer. She is totally self-absorbed and fussy. There's one remarkable exchange that makes her look so bad that it's a wonder it found its way into the book.   She has a friend of whom she writes "If it weren't for Shakuntala, I would be very alone here." After an anonymous sexual encounter with a complete stranger who knocks on her door in the middle of the night she expresses her shame to her friend, who is packing to go home to visit her dying father. Zeppa asks her friend if she thinks her mystery man will tell others. "Jamie," her friend says. "My father is dying."  Shortly thereafter she meets a man she likes a great deal. She meets him on page 217 and the rest of the book, through page 303, is devoted almost entirely to the romance. Nearly a third of the book! She goes into a level of detail that is excruciating. What's worse, the love story reveals almost nothing about Bhutan. It's a generic "clash of cultures" romance. The book changes from a daily diary into a Harlequin romance. At no point does it feel like a true travel memoir. What a wasted opportunity.   
 "Untidy Endings" could be a description of many of the Jury books, this one in particular. It's not even close to a complete story, but rather a filler, to be resolved at a later date.  I'm getting a little confused with the setting in place and time. If Jury was a small child during the Battle of Britain, he would be in or near his 70's now. Is the timeline is running slowly, as in Sue Grafton's alphabet series, where Kinsey Milhone is still in the 80's?  Then some things would make sense, but other references would not.  Also, some Americanisms are present that should have been British slang instead.  These faults make for distracting reading.   Martha Grimes has written from a dog's viewpoint before to good effect, so that anyone who has a dog would be able recognize those past dogs, but Mungo's actions in this book are just a little too much.  And the recurrent cliche of "kid-jep" as Grimes herself classifies it herself in a previous Jury mystery, is becoming truly cliche.  This just wasn't her best 
 I am embarrased to say it, but I've read this book at least 10 times.  The nightmare began some 8 years ago when at the urging of a "friend" I entered rehab for what would become the first of many such "treatments". The indoctrination process began immediately. "The first 163 pages will save your ..." was just one of the things I was told by some washed up alcoholic who once resorted to drinking Sterno while living homeless in some ravine.  It never stopped. Go to enough AA meetings and you'll hear the same things over and over and over...you get the idea. How quickly we (newcomers) were brainwashed. For me there was always an uneasy feeling. It was creepy to hear those who were only days out of rehab sound off parroting the same sentiments and cliches of their sponsors. An ominous warning I should have paid attention to.   Years later I realize that I was one of the unfortunate souls that was swept away into a religious cult with the help of counselors, social workers, 12 steppers and even doctors. I became sicker, despondent and my drinking and using worsened.  My sanity was replaced with the belief that I was powerless and my only hope was within "the Program". There's a good reason they call it your "Program". I became a 12 step automaton immersing myself deeper into the religiousity of AA with each successive relapse. I did it all. A meeting every day, working the steps, attending step studies, service work, conventions, retreats...you name it-I did it. I surrendered common sense and reason and followed the direction of 12 step fruitcakes. If you are newly sober and looking for help look elsewhere. This book is a waste of time and may even be hazardous to your health. If it's a support group you think you need go to a Life Ring meeting or better yet stay home and read Rational Recovery or one of Ellis' books. Do not go to  12 step meetings. I haven't been to an AA meeting in close to 2 years and I am finally sober and happy. Go figure. Stay away from 12 steppers. It took me years to come to this realization and that is this - Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are more concerned with AA than they are with helping people stay sober. Just take a look at the numbers. The vast majority of recovered addicts/alcoholics recover without 12 step involvement. AA and its evil spawn NA have hurt more people than they have helped. 
 Most everything included here is common sense.  There are a few important concepts included here, but they are better covered in other texts 
 The absolute worst book eve 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 I saw this film in the 60's ...and it certainly hasn't improved with age; unless you view watching grass grow as a highlight of your daily existence.  This film plods along at an excruciatingly, slow pace until you are ready to scream for it to end.  It's nothing more than the film version of pop art: a simplistic story of a photographer who shot a murder on film; which is subsequently stolen.  End of plot and movie, unless you enjoy watching mimes playing tennis at the end.  Don't waste valuable time making sense of this film.  You'd be better off watching clouds and interpreting what you see in them and what they mean, and probably get more out of that experience then you would watching this film! 
 Omg, I got these headphones and they suck!!! I am not even kidding, they are probably the worst headphones in the world and the worst headphones i've had in my life...first of all, when you listen to music there is a loud hissssss noise in the backround, second, these don't even fit over your freakin ears...haha, also, they are tooo bulky, you can't do anything with them...the sound quality is ok...but if your looking for noise cancelling headphones, i dont recommend these, i recommend the sony fontopia headphones or the 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones that are ear buds and not too bulky (availible at brookstones)...now those are what you call great, these panasonic earfones are just horrible compared to these, it only takes out like a little of the noise, but the sony 120 dollar ones at brookstone takes out 70% OF THE NOISE! that's amazing, it is probably why they are so expensive...well i have to leave but this is my advice to you DON'T EVER EVER BUY THESE HEADPHONES IN YOUR LIFE!!! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!! hope this helped 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 If you have not read the book, then this movie may intrigue you. It is quirky and interesting to say the least. As a storyline it does not lack imagination. From Maine to Vienna to NYC and back to Maine, from the Jew-hating German tourists to the radicals and the [...], from one Hotel New Hampshire to another, the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events. And life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams.  Now, in relation to the actual book, this movie can be described with just one word: RUSHED. The adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything, all characters and all events, thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family. I could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily, how the scenes lack emotional depth, how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed... but I will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short. If the book was a long wave-like function, with a rise to a crest, then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest, over and over and over again, then the movie was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave-like function, shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender, where they were shaken and served to please God knows what. Surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book, nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone. And it was not for lack of effort. It was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes. A mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation. Either that or a more free-flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture.  Thank God for Jodie Foster's and Beau Bridges's performances, who bring Fanny and Win Berry to life. Keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience. As far as this movie is concerned, just toss it out as far as you can. And if you are to keep it, then do so to remind yourselves of how to NOT adapt a great book onto the screen. This is the only reason why I keep mine 
 Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for "more than 3 weeks." I hope they will replace my unit with something that works 
 I hate to judge a book like this based on only one issue, but as a gay man, this is an important issue for me. In answer to the question "What role does homosexuality play in human relationship?", Emmanual gives the following answer (I'll use slashes instead of the poetic line breaks):  "A necessary one./It is a means of loving./It is a means of reaching for oneness./It is a means to camouflage fear./It is, in short, a path.  "It is difficult to accept unification/because you live in a world/that encourages the either-or illusion./But things are becoming more closely aligned./Many people are learning to accept/their androgynous natures./Some express it in homosexuality,/which is an overstatement, however,/because of the need to accept/the sexual structure of the physical world./Nevertheless, in the long run/it is a healthy statement in your civilization./Ultimately we are all androgynous."  Despite the apparently encouraging beginning ("It is necessary"), this passage is troubling for several reasons. Homosexuality is defined as "a means to camouflage fear," whereas heterosexual relationships are not defined thus. Next, Emmanuel seems to identify homosexuality with androgeny, which are obviously two different things. A man can be extremely masculine and gay, just as a man can be feminine in some ways and be straight.  Then Emmanuel says that homosexuality is an "overstatement," whatever that means, "because of the need to accept the sexual structure of the physical world." Emmanuel seems to be saying here that homosexuality is somehow less favorable because of an inherent heterosexual structure to the physical world.  I cannot believe that the God which Emmanuel describes throughout the book would really care or choose to distinguish between the genders of two souls who reach out to each other. Perhaps Emmanuel's views on this subject are colored by Pat Rodegast's own confused and ambivalent attitudes toward homosexuality.  Thanks but no thanks 
 I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.  After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd.  Come on, guys, you can do better than this 
 I have just returned from walking the Camino from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Finisterre, and I used this book as my travelguide. I know that only one star is a tough judgment, but this book has too many inaccurate kilometers, and too many failures about which cities who has/has not alberques (the places where you can overnight as a pilgrim). When you walk the Camino, you certainly need to have a very accurate guide with you, and therefore I can not recommend this out-dated one. 
 This book has the dubious honor of being the WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.  And with the variety and amount of books I read that's saying a lot.  Poorly written, thinly (and that's generous) developed characters, trite dialog, and was there a plot in there somewhere?  I never met a more unlikeable protagonist than Maggie, nor did I care what happened to her or her ex-husbands.  And WTF was Baraba Streisand doing in this???  Truly a nightmare of a novel.  Note to Mr. Patterson:  When you go through the process of writing a book, convincing people to publish it, then ask readers to invest time and money into purchasing and reading it, have a point.  On behalf of all the readers who suffered through til the end, I demand our time and money back 
  To answer another customer, YES UNFORTUNATELY I DID ACTUALLY SEE THE ENTIRE MOVIE FROM HIIDIOUS BEGINNING TO ITS AWEFUL END.  I DO SO TOTALLY WISH I COULD SUE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE HOW HIGH TO GET BACK THE MOMENTS OF MY LIFE WASTED WATCHING THIS DRECK!  Thank goodness a friend of mine rented it instead of my having brought this trash.  I might share a movie I loved with people to a point but watching this movie was like taking a late night stroll through solid matter seperation tanks of sewage treatment plant in the heat of a still humid sweltering summer evening, not an experience one wishes to relive or share with others.  Generally I do not like druggie movies, but I have liked a few Car Wash, Which Way Is Up.  Even Cheech and Chong has more entertainment value than this critter. Oh I saw the all the black lackeys in the DVD including the Harvard token and to that I say one drop of dignity will not put out an inferno of toady stupidity. I know humor when I see it I just wish this How High had even the least little bit of humor in it for me to see.  I even like a good black exploitation movie like "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" which has no redeeming attributes but it was farce in weird and stupid way that did not suggest the kind of patently negative message How High touts.  I often do not go into too much detail about a film because as bad as I might find something I won't be a spoiler.  My tastes in movies and books are generally not the mainstream which is cool by me.  Even if I hate a movie I will respect the artist enough not to ruin a movie for those others who might like it.  Where I come from not being a spoiler is just simple respect likely something not everyone can understand.  This ranks as the most racially INSULTING vile stupid DVD I have ever seen.  The premise of the story is that black people (Black men in this particular case.) are so lame loathesome and hopelessly dumb that they can not logically be considered worthy of advancing to Harvard or other such IVY League Colleges without the help of "MAGICAL DOPE".  I honestly suspect the only person needing and using MAGICAL DRUGS WAS THE DOPE WHO WROTE THIS DRECK ONLY TO PLACE THIS SPAWN OF HIS PROFOUND NEVER ENDED STUPIDITY ON DVD.  I think less of this foolish DVD than I do those old racist movies that portrayed all black people as, "Simple House Boys" bowing and scraping their way through life with the sole goal of "pleasin da masta".  At least older racially debased films lay legitimate claim to being products of a largely ignorant social and intellectual neanderthal nation mired in institutional hate biogotry and oppression.  What makes this DVD especially bad is the fact that this is the new face of bigoted negativity in our modern age where some hip hop lackey's gladly take money to create messages that oppress and sell out our own black children.  The suggestion that black people are by nature of birth \ genetics alone inferior is wrapped into the core message of this DVD's storyline.  To watch this DVD youo must buy into its supposition that black people need MAGIC WEED, dope or some other supernatural transcending experience to become the intellectual equals of those who attend ivy league colleges which is the very height of today's more furtive ignorant stupid mindless bigotry disguised as comedy.  This DVD functions as a racist tool to rob black men of their dignity, inner strength and self worth by suggesting as truth the lie that we need "MAGIC" to become the equals of those in this society who are afforded opportunities to acheive great things.  Tell all the dopes who made this racist DVD you are not buying into their bright new package of old tired racist lies preaching the hate filled Gospel of supposed inheirent black inferiority by leaving this DVD trash on the shelf to rot.  Please do not buy this racist DVD media tool that insults the dignity and intelligence of every black man that has and will ever live.  I pray every black white red yellow whatever your race are stronger and better than sinking low enough to buy this racist filth 
 doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths." 2 Timothy 4:3-4  This verse was written by Paul almost 2000 years ago to warn the Christians to guard their hearts from false teachings that will arise from among the Church. - "and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking preserve things, to draw away their disciples after them." - Acts 20:30-31    As a servant of the Lord, I feel strongly compelled by His Spirit to warn my fellow Christians of the false doctrine being taught by Tim LaHaye.  This man and his partner are being used by Satan himself to decieve millions of Christians across the nation concerning the truth and the end times of this earth, and this is making me sick.  Tell me why Tim LaHaye, who has never studied theological doctrine or mastered the Bible's teachings, has sold millions upon millions of books regarding prophecy.    The verse that I started with clearly tells us why.  If Tim LaHaye really loves God, than he would respect His Holy Word including God's sacred prophecies.  But instead of writing a book strictly on the Holy prophecies of God to bring Him the glory, Tim chooses to envelop God's sacred prophecies with his fictitious novels known as the Left Behind Series.  Now what were his motives for doing this?  To interpret the scriptures correctly, or to sell millions of novels and receive the wealth and fame for himself? For those of you who read his novels, did you desire to truly know what the Bible says concerning prophecies or did you enjoy having your ears "tickled" by his fanciful writing. "but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires."    In the past year, a man completed devoted to God, has taken up the monumental task of writing a new book to help clear the confusion behind the modern view of Biblical prophecies.  The book is called End Time Delusions by Steve Wohlberg, and unfortunaley, it is directed at refuting many of the false teachings endorsed by the Left Behind novels.  Mr. Wohlberg has been earnestly studying Biblical prophecies for the past 25 years.  Everything he comments on is strongly supported by the scriptures and he encourages every reader to evaluate the Bible before establishing an opinion.  The book is concise (220 pages), but it is jam-packed with years and years of extensive research.  May the Lord be with you as you continue to search the scriptures for the truth.  "For the truth will set you free! 
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 Most of the time only review good hardcore gangsta sh*t. Thats where the name muziktodriveby comes from. If they ain't gangsta they at least sound good in the ride. So I felt dumb one day and listened to crime mob. There name is crime mob they got to be gangsta. They ain't. They try hard to be gangsta but fail miserably. They sound like D4L, Dem Franchize Boyz, and any other snap music slash crunk SH*T. The south is becoming a joke, hip hop as a whole is a joke. Come on fiddy singing window shopper dat ni@@a is singing.You got juelz santana sampling Mr. Postman from the fifties. Dats not gangsta. At least in the 90's ni@@as was more convincing with that sh*t. Last but not least is D4L with Laffy F*ckin Taffy. What is that a metaphore for, my girl loves that song I should smack her for that. Anyway I went on a rant. If you like the groups I mentioned than you will uhh, apreciate this. If you hate this listen to something else. In fact I'll recomend something as a service to the hip hop community. Listen to Above The Laws time will reveal its gangsta and chill. Peac 
 The Maverick guide to Bermuda didn't meet the high expectations set by other reviews here. There isn't a whole lot to the book, it isn't full of secret suggestions as others suggested.  Instead there is much on the obvious basics and little beyond. Our family did enjoy the chapter discussing some of the colorful history of Bermuda, but otherwise I regret the purchase.  I suspect one of the other guidebooks would have been a better choice. I do recommend Bermuda 
 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.  I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this.  For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example) 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 There's no doubt that Deborah Garrison's poetry is accessible, but so are Hallmark cards and children's books.  Don't waste your dime on this kitschy collection. If you're looking for accessible poetry, try Tony Hoagland or Billy Collins for size.  If you have an Elvis on velvet painting hanging in your living room, then you'd probably love Deborah's gifted use of cliches 
 The other negative reviews are correct.  Too small, can't see screen, the fit is so tight it affects the wheel.  I spent $30 dollars on a little strip of cloth that actually makes my nano and nike+ useless.  If this was designed and made by some 3rd party it would make a little bit of sense, but as it is, I have no idea how they screwed this up so badly 
 Fellini brings light on space instead of space on light.  He brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism.  He brings boredom and rattling to a new height.  Lots of nice emotionalism and sweat.  Waging tongues and blood. Candles and tits.  Bondage and perversion.   We learn Italian words that we can not use.  Here is a good tidbit "Child of Aphrodite and Hermes...Hermaphrodite."  The subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments. Even in Italian the voices do not match the sound.   One of the roman dudes Encolpio (Martin Potter) finally got a real part as "Doctor Who" in1983. 
 This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as "B".....  This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; " Fugetaboutit"!! He is a long, long way from the Masters .. 
 I had to buy this book for a class on Teaching for Academic Literacy. The class, like the book, was a waste of time and money. Basically, the book consists of modules, and each module is designed to teach you how to conduct a particular activity with your students, such as how to teach your students to classify things. Then each module ends with a rubric for assessing your understanding, and pages of space to allow you to reflect on your enjoyment of classifying. So basically, you only have to read the first couple of pages of any module. So go to the library, check out the book and read those pages, and don't waste your money 
 When I first got this charger and started using it I thought it was great.  It did what it was supposed to do.  Why the one star then?  After about two weeks it just stopped working.  It didn't fall or anything.  It died about two weeks after I got it.  I can't really complain though, after all it cost me 5 bucks 
 In the whole book there were only one or two items that attracted me. Most items are pretty ordinary; some are distinguished by frills or other design elements that I don't happen to like. Not a terrible book; and maybe in time I'll warm up to it. But if I'd seen it at a bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 The idea of a horror movie taking place in an isolated DJ booth sounds like it should be a good, scary time.  Ghosts calling in on the DJ and exposing truths best left hidden.  The feeling of being trapped in a room where everyone can hear you starting to lose your mind.  The unrecognizable sounds coming through over the phone.  But the Booth spends very little time creating what could be a horror classic.  Instead we have an unlikable DJ-lead character who becomes more unlikable as the film goes on.  We have little hints as to this DJ's past indiscressions through various phone calls and coincidences.  (While this could have been a cool story device, it is ruined by the use of too many flashbacks to retell the story.  A main part of the story is the DJ's life as a pre-teen.)  The movie has a strong opening of a DJ 40 years before getting a call about an unfulfilled suicide pact.  But the film is dull from that point on and never picks u 
 When I read this book in college, I thought of myself as a progressive thinker. The philosophy I read in the book was so twisted and exaggerated, it began a long, slow and comprehensive change in my entire paradigm of policital thinking 
 I think that one of the things about our society is that nowadays, if you do so much as rate a book regarding homosexuals (or a movie, such as Brokeback Mountain)-- if you give it a bad rating, people will call you a homophobe. I mean, come on. A bad book is a bad book. This book is a bad book. It was extremely short. The characters were virtually unlikeable and one-dimensional. You knew what was going to happen right from the beginning. It really just wasn't worth my time 
 I'm not buying this CD because I just found out it's Mortal Coil's track which is missing which completely ruins the whole CD.  That song is SO beautiful.  Why is it not on the CD? That's why I'm giving it one star although the other music used was highly effective 
 Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs. Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality 
 I am not sure why my school chose this book/ Author. I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys using this book. I give it 2 stars only because it has all the NANDA dx in it (if you can find them!)I find it very time consuming. If you enjoy flipping back and forth to several pages without much help in finding what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. Index aside, this book needs to be more user friendly. I simply do not like the way it is organized. Risk Factors are seperate from Nursing DX, but stuck in the middle of the book, good luck following from one section to another! There is no friendly flow in this book to use it efficiently. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. There has got to be a better way to write this book 
 This video was bought as a reward for my 3 year old who is learning to use the potty. The video contents are about what you would expect if you have seen any other of these dr.seuss videos--basically still shots with dialogue, not rocket science by any stretch of the imagination. The shocking thing was the actual quality of the tape is abysmal---almost unwatchable, tracking and all. I would NOT buy this and can only hope that my son doesn't show his disgust in more tangible way 
 I' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht I picked up a few urs  Don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors.  That's the kyboard, nome!!  I'mt ba to to y na o y n Acino esr I ia.  Ok, switching over to a wired keyboard!!  The above mess was me trying to type on the Microsoft 6000 V2 Keyboard!!  I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!!  I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!)  No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it!  Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.)  Better luck to the rest of you 
 In trying to get it set up, I went through multiple help technicians, most of  whom were difficult to understand   All that was accomplished was to mess up our internet connection, and then was told that my ISP would have to straighten out the problems Belkin created. One technician was honest enough to admit that the install disc was practically worthless.  Otherwise, it was nothing but a headache of waiting on the phone, being cut off, being shuttled around, and getting nothing done.  We did finally have good success, with another product 
 also import a cd , money down the drai 
 I was hoping this book would be a bit more concrete in suggestions and ways to do exactly what the title implied, but I found it to be too free spirited and 'out there' for my personal liking.  It just wasn't enough to motivate me to give it even 5 bad minutes each morning 
 The Chicken Soup stories follow a formula, and are too sentimental for me. Some people like them though, and that's okay 
 This is a waste book that makes you go to sleep in 2 minutes.  the content is poorly organized, the authors don't seem to have any knowledge of the topics covered for the exam.  This book totally is a waste of your time, money and energy 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 This was the only movie in the trilogy that I thought was clean enough to get a G rating.  They did not follow the story line from the last two films.  We meet a new Villian Belandona Ambells evil sister who has manipulated Carfaxce and his minnion Killer to help here ruin Christmas.  How careface got on Earth when he supposed to be dead and be in Hell is never covered. They have a cheesy flash back when you find out why he became such a bad dog.  Charlie is supposed to alive giving and second chance at the end of second film When he returned Gabriels horn. Belandona is decent but not as evil as the other villians I have seen if on my top hundred villans list Belandona is 11th in the top 20.  The 1st Sauron.  The 2th Naraku. 3th Malificent. 4th Cluney. The 5th Slagar the cruel.  The 6th Tasarmina. 7th. Badrang.  8th Golloum 9th Team Rocket. Tenth  Kagura.  I hardly recommend you don't she this movie it sucks even though it has a happy ended. And Carface goes good 
 This as a new and "improved" Zyliss press. It does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a "nonstick" surface. It is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing. The holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick. Difficult and time consuming. I have sent multiple e-mails to Zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions. Zyliss does not respond.   The companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative. Don't buy their products 
 "Voices from the Street" is supposedly a study of one man's descent into madness, a subject that fans of Dick know well. This novel however doesn't work, and it shows that publishers are scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Dick spends a lot of time developing the secondary characters and never gives more than passing glimpses of what is happening inside the main character's head. Once the character does snap, Dick rushes through it to get to the overly long epilogue.  From a writer's perspective, Dick learned a lot from writing this novel, primarily that insane characters are more interesting after the onset than before, and plot structures and themes of his later books derived great benefits from this experiment.  Therein lies any insight that fans of Dick can get from this book. The author uses several different approaches in writing about a character who is losing it. For the most part, these techniques either fail or offer mediocre results, and to the best of my knowledge, I do not remember Dick using them in his later books with characters with impaired cognition. Compare "Voices from the Street" with "A Scanner Darkly" (ignoring of course the SF elements of the latter) and notice how the development in ASD is so much richer and focused. Notice too how the secondary characters support the plot rather than usurping it.  As an unpublished novel, VFTS is still a pivotal novel between Dick's early work and that of his middle and late career. It shows an author honing his craft, but it is more like looking in an artist's sketchbook rather than admiring a masterpiece. Casual fans of Dick will not miss anything by skipping over this book. 
 I loved Dr. Pert's previous book, The Molecules of Emotion.  I was thrilled to hear this new book was being released and couldn't wait to get a copy.  The title of this book made bold promises, but I was disappointed to find that it failed miserably to deliver.  I expected a book that would outline activities or exercises to practice the art and science of feeling good and finding one's self in the presence of God in a present-moment way.   The book offered neither, but rather, rambled on and on, outlining Ms. Pert's own life's journey in an in-your-face sales-pitch "I got it, you should too" presentation that only flaunted, and failed to ever really teach.    Ms. Pert's discussions on dietary health and wholeness were limited and contradictory at best.  If you want real data backed by science in this area, I suggest the writings of Dr. John McDougall (especially the McDougall Plan and The McDougall Program), John Robbins, and particularly T. Colin Campbell's China Study.  Little concrete information was really offered in the practice of "feeling good."  If you want practical information and a firm plan that promises results in this area, Dr. Laurel Mellin's The Pathway does more than deliver on such promises.  Recovery from trauma was mentioned, but never really addressed in a practical manner.  Dr. Peter A. Levine's Waking the Tiger and Healing Trauma give deep insights and practical attacks for freedom.    God was promised in the title, but barely even mentioned in the text of the book, most notably almost as an afterthought in the epilogue.  Practitioners of energy healing arts were given far more press than was God.  If it's God you're seeking, the works of Dan Allender (The Cry of the Soul, To Be Told), John Eldredge (The Sacred Romance, The Journey of Desire, Waking the Dead), Brennan Manning (The Ragamuffin Gospel) and the Scriptures will serve you far, far better in the desire for God.  The photograph on the back cover of this book does not appear to be that of someone who is has mastered health and happiness and is living in the presence of God, but rather, that of someone struggling in all of these areas.  I wish Dr. Pert well and no harm, but I have to say I'm completely disappointed in this book 
 I bought this book for two reasons:  I wanted to get more familiar with the whole pulp culture and the reviews here gave the idea that the plot was experimental in a kind of fun way.  What I found was no true characters at all, no memorable situations, no exciting action, no beautiful or unique places, nothing funny, very little of the stylish 30s/40s things I expected from it, very little anything.  Of course there were the recurrent pulp references, but the pulp never got a proper foothold either. Almost as if the writer was in a limbo between making it a slice-of life piece for pulp author fanboys/girls, a homage to pulp, Zhang Mei's life story and actual pulp action. Neither really worked in my opinion.  A few pieces I liked were in the start when he described a smokey bar where  the mysterious pulp authors gathered and where Walter Gibson told the story of the Sweet Flower Wars in the Chinatown, his description of H.P. Lovecraft's personal life and when they were making plans of what a The Shadow movie should look like... But moments like that were seriously really rare.  I may have missed the point somehow but I seriously couldn't read it for more than 20 pages at a time without putting it down. If you absolutely have to get it, at least get the paperback 
 I have bought a few books by Denise Austin and I thought this one would be a greta idea, but I didn't really like it. The first portion of the book before you reach the 21 days is great information, but the meal plans did not seem very appetizing to me. She says that you need to stick to her exact routine for it to work and it just did not fit into my life and it has been sitting on the book shelf ever since 
 This book is so outdated. All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past. There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books 
 then a lot of people died fighting in the wrong cause for this country.  No one went to war for this country to defend a socialist nation; they fought to keep it from becoming a socialist nation.  Most of what the far left stands for is the exact opposite of what this country has fought, bled, and died for 
 About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.   The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.   To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.      
 First off, I do not agree with Evolution, in any way, shape, or form.  However, I will say that Darwin, unlike most so called "scientists," esp. Evolutionists freely admitted that there was more to learn in the comming years, and that his theories, or hypothesis, might have to be seriously reconsidered if new scientific evidence was discovered that did not corroborate his views.    Most of what I see in scientific debates comes down to pure and simple prideful blustering, and hateful muddslinging!!!  It seems more favorable and a hec of alot easier to smear the opponant than to honestly, critically, and civily debate another person with whom you disagree.  Ego, Ego, Ego, and more Egomaniacal Monkeyshines!!!!!  I am new to this whole debate (Evolution vs. Creation / Intelligent Design), and I have alot to learn on both sides of the issue, but I can tell you this, I am honest, and civil enough to at least make an honest attempt at respecting the other side, as someone, who in my opinion, may be "wrong," but is also a human being deserving of proper respect, esp. if they have devoted years to honest scientific investigation.  All sides need to learn CIVILITY, and PROFESSIONAL RESPECT, WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TODAY, MORE THAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  This is a foundational work which started the whole Evolution landslide. Anyone who truly wishes to debate, refute, or otherwise understand the theory should read it carefully.  Just as one should read carefuly, and critically those foundational works on Creation Science (A real science) and Intelligent Design (A true Scientific Theory).   Be REAL SCIENTISTS AND INVESTIGATE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE, OR DON'T BELIEVE.   I seriously doubt that Civility will ever come to the Scientific Community as a whole, as so few people are truly willing to lay down their Egos to search out truth, especially if the opposite of their own views is terrifying to them.   Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 Mr. Bach starts off with a good personal example, that both brings a smile to your face, and helps you to relate to the subject topic.  However, in about the first ten minutes of the tape, he continually repeats, something about being someone who has "personally coached literally thousands of couples..." over and over and over again, ad nauseum, till I finally had to eject the tape.  He is about one of the most self-grandiose presenter/speakers I have ever heard, but sadly also typical of the "personal-coach" movement.  I sure hope his book is not like this, but I am afraid to waste my money on another one of his products.  He may have some good input and advice, but he should just cut to the chase, instead of the contiuous self-hype/promotion routine 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I saw this recently and was to say the least, very disturbed by the video surveilence of Kell KILLING Blackmon. It is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual. Troy Kell comes from Nevada, he has, now, no life..he has not had one since he was 17. He was incarcerated for a BRUTAl murder of a Man who was "stalking and harrassing" his childhood friend, "Sandy". He committeda brutal crime, shot a man 6 (SIX) times in the head at close range. This documentary shows the real inside of prison life, allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual. Kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent. But is he really?, he is now on Death Row. Very good documentary but also very disturbing 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 Yesterday I gave up on continuing to read this book. I gave up on page 228, after a completely exaggerated scene did little to alleviate the general atmosphere of long-winded boredom in the book.   My main problem with this book is that far more room is given to the personal problems of the police people and the doctor involved in the crime than to the crime itself. The crime itself sounded interestingly enough, but in the first 228 pages at least, it seemed to be a mere sideline. When writing crime stories, it is always a problem how to handle the personalities of those that are solving the crime. Of course they shouldn't be completely "anonymous" people with no life of their own, but on the other hand the reader buys the book to read about the crime and therefore doesn't care too much for reading about the police person's problems with his mother. In Kisscut, most of the people don't even have one private issue to deal with, but several. Highly annoying because it takes away from the real story.   The most annoying intrusion of private life is that of the highly unlikeable policewoman Lena. She suffered a terrible ordeal in the past (apparently covered in a previous book by Karin Slaughter) and the reader is constantly reminded of this ordeal. There are passages in the book where it is mentioned on almost every single page until I at least felt like shouting "Yes, allright, I got the point!"  So, maybe the crime story was good. But it is buried until so many other stories that the reader doesn't even get a chance to read about it. I do not recommend this book. 
 that a book about real estate (creating FINANCIAL independence no less), both residential and COMMERCIAL, and covers no math, no numbers.  How can a book even propose to teach you about real estate and not tell you how to evaluate it?  Real estate, or any investment for that matter, is ALL about the numbers. The numbers it does include are so basic, anyone who tried to buy an apartment complex or commercial property using them would be slaughtered 
 I was interested in reading this book after seeing an interview with the author (Stephen Singular) on CNN.  However, as soon as I started reading this book it was obvious that the author Singular delves to far into self indulgence time and time again.    At times it seems he is simply writing just for the sake of writing, often times describing the weather and a truly ridiculous paragraph about a certain crop that was imported into the Wichita area.  And there is also a strong christian viewpoint the author is writing from, which grows rather tiresome.  For anyone that is interested in true crime books, pass on this one, or at least wait until it comes out in paperback (I wasted over $20.00 dollars on this book). 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 It is an inspiring story of truly epic proportions. One problem though.  Bruce Olsen couldn't write to save his life.   I am no stranger to books such as this, I have read dozens and all of them are interesting in their own way, this by no means is the worst of the pack but I had heard such good things about it, probably the only reason I am giving this two stars instead of at least a weak three is because of the dissapointment I faced in comparison to what I had heard. 
 I think I'm one of the biggest Hiatt fans ever and  I used to consider him God of songwriting. With this one he povd to me he's human. I just don't think it's up there with "Bring the Family" or "Stolen Moments" or "Walk On", or Beneath This Gruff Exterior." Sounds like he may have originally decided not to release these but changed his mind. Maybe it's me but I don't get it 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 As usual, this book ignores the 16-20 million non Jewish victims of the holocaust. This is very disappointing. The holocaust is not exclusively to Jews-as historians have portrayed it. What about the 7 million Ukraines? MIllions of Polish, prisoners of war, crippled, handicapped...I guess historians view their lives as less valuable 
 My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire. 
 When does it become evident that Strobel isn't interested in the truth? From all the 5-star reviews on this board, it's clear that Strobel's evangelizing and lack of honesty is what passes for "journalism."  As in his other "Case" books, Strobel pretends to care about objectivity and journalistic integrity (and even a little about science!), but all interest in truth-seeking falls victim to Strobel's Discovery Institute agenda.  In this book, the arguments are either constructed using the Bible (though the author or his "experts" do nothing to attempt to prove the Bible's inerrant accuracy) or are full of fallacy. Like when Craig argues that Jesus's claim that he was the son of a god was either because he was insane or the son of a god. Considering he didn't display any other signs of hysteria (how does he know this?), he must be the heir of the divine! This is False Dichotomy. What about the possibility that Jesus didn't exist? Or that his claim was a parable? Or that he never claimed to be a god?  Et cetera. The book is short, thankfully. Someone with a proper grasp of science and what it is, and history and what it is, would grow increasingly frustrated with a longer "journalistic" work so full of bias 
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.

 Last year for Calc AB, I relied mostly on my notes nd managed to get a 4. This year my teacher was horrible nd I actually tried to use this book to review BC material nd I could not understand it. I think I got a 3 or 4. The questions are way too difficult. Also, you can tell this book wont help you when you look to the explanation to understand a question and it gives a one sentence answer which means nothing. I used barrons for my SAT I math and got a 790. Most of its books are good, but this one surely isnt. You're better off with the Arco, CliffsAP, or even Princeton review. anything but Barrons 
 This is like a crude disney movie with random bits of nudity.   Why was this movie made 
 While it has multiple sizes, the earphones do not fit well. They also do not have clear sound coming through them, unless you press them firmly into your ear. Lots of vibration sound and actually makes it sound like they are blown 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 An incredibly jargon-laden work. Sadly, many of the contributors really have nothing to say and spend a long time not saying it. On a few occasions, however, some of the contributions really shine and remind one that not all of academia is populated by mediocrity 
 This book isnt actually about what its like to be a Palestinian Christian.  First of all 80% of Palestinian Christians dont live on the West Bank, but in Israel, whereas this book focuses only on the west bank and Gaza.    This book portrays the one sided very anti-ISrael and pro-terror view point of a very unchristian preacher.  A preacher of hate who would do as well at a Hamas gathering.  Jesus preached peace.  This book preaches support and excuses for murder.  This book doesnt tell the whole story.  For instance we dont learn here about the Hamas takeover of Bethlehem and the Islamist riots in nazareth against Christians.  We dont learn here about the death threats christian men receive who date muslim women.  We dont learn here about the PA marriage code which discriminates against mixed christian marriages by ensuring the offspring are muslim.  We dont learn here about the total marginalizing of the Christian community in Palestine and its eclipse by radical Islam.  This book is about one Christians private support for terrorism and his hatred of Israel.  This book is not an objective account written lucidly about the true identity of Palestinian Christians. On September 5th, 2005 Rampaging Islamist mobs torched 15 houses and caused the entire Christian community of Taiba to flee their homes near Ramallah as the PA watched and did nothing.  The crime of that community?  One Christian man from the village had dated a Muslim women.  This is the true plight of the Palestinian christian one doesnt find in this account. The identity of those Christians is not told here.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 We ordered what we thought was a Drinkwell fresh water fountain based on the header and description of the product.  However, when we received it, there was just the resevoir in the box.  We returned the item to Petsmart and then went to Petco and purchased a different model.  We felt the ad was very misleading.  It should have clearly stated that the item we were purchasing was only the resevoir and not the fountain.  
 I believe you are referring to Deu 18:10 - 12.  I make more typos than most..lol.  Anyway, this chapter is addressing the Levites (Tribe of Levi) only.  We should not pick and choose phrases and use them out of context.    Also, if you really want to understand the "Old Testament", read some good research books from the Jewish Publication Society or the Jewish Lights Publishers.  Her books are good, not great.  Nothing new inside but it is a good way to bring Gnosticism and Spiritism to lay people.  Allan Kardec stated most of what is contained in her books in his works.    This particular little book is good mainly for the CDRom 
 I saw the hyped-reviews of this book, and thought it might be a fun read since I like scary stuff.  Unfortunately, it is very poorly written.  The author never describes this "world" adequately to his readers.  Fantastic facts of this underworld are brought up only when needed for the plotline.  For example, when one character needs to speak to one of the "gods," she steps into a portal, which gives her access to this god.  Before then, we never heard anything about "portals" inside the house, and I don't think they were mentioned again.  Poor, poor, writing.  The publishing house employees must be the ones writing the rave reviews.  Skip this one, or suffer 
 Terrible movie, bottom line  I guess this 'could' be enjoyable for kids but anyone that was a fan of the Street Fighter video games will be revolted at this hideous piece of work.  I watched this with friends when we had a 'Bad Movie Night' and I suppose it has SOME merit when used for that purpose, but it was so poor I don't know if I could even watch it again for that reason.  * NOT RECOMMENDE 
 Human slavery was embraced and endorsed both by the Koran and the Hadith.  Islamic slavery begain with Mohammed and continued until the 1900"sfor 200 years after slavery had been abolished in the west.  Saudi Arabia did not abolish slavery until 1964, Kuwait did not abolish slavery until 1968.  Slavery is Islamic as daily prayers.  Robert Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes and sold into slavery in the Ummayad, Abassid and Ottoman empires.  The general practice was to castrate the males and press them into military service.  No Muslim can object to slavery as it was fully endorsed by Mohammed and it become the military modus operandi of the successors to Mohammed who successfully used slavery soldier in their campaigs of conquest 
 After having seen this movie, I understand why Europeans, Arabs and everybody else hates Americans... There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.  The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.  Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building. Everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself.  It's a miracle to us, how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining - the movie is bad, pretending it to be a satyre doesn't make it any better 
 Barry Longyear's story is perfect. This movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff? They should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit. That totally ruined the movie for me. The novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt; the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity, if love doesn't prevail, at least strives to be better. In the movie, they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the Dracs. Did we learn NOTHING from the USA's foray into slavery and brutality? IT seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the 13-18 year old testosterone crown, thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect. But, when has Hollywood ever gotten it right? They usually find some way to shoot themselves in the foot. 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 Order the shoe on 5 Feb and received on 13 Feb.  Great feel and good looking shoe.  Only problem is there's a fold on top of the left shoe that doesn't look normal????? 
 I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it.  In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous!  She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own.  Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money 
 Random conversation with guitar feedback behind it, clips of read newspaper articles,\a baby's heartbeat...that's bad. There are two tracks I like here: Two Minutes Silence (You'd be hard pressed to find a more self-explanitory title) and Radio Airplay, nice idea behind the latter. At least you get music. Terrible, like Two Virgins and Wedding Album, but I have to say it's the best of the bunch 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Wow! I use Pacific Foods beef and chicken stock all the time & I guess I expected more! Convenience isn't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed!!!! Hardly any barley or beef! I cooked up one bag & I'm throwing the rest out 
  I was okay with the contents of the book until I got to the section about personal protection.   The blunt statement is made that women backpackers should never carry a gun.   I disagree with the author on this point.  This is a personal choice that thank God, women are able to make for themselves in many areas of the USA.   A small revolver is not very heavy, and if a woman is trained and can legally carry a firearm,  it is very approriate for many hikes in this day in age.    
 I unintentionally purchased a '2006' calendar in mid-December 2006. Does this make any sense?  I messed up.  But, did AMAZON Screw me?  The stupid calendar was basically full price although the year was over.  I made a crazy error purchasing the calendar based on the topic:  Mules; overlooking that it was for '06 and NOT '07'.  Yes, my error, a common one at that as it was near time for a new year and I just ASSumed that only an '07 calendar would be offered at a full price in December.  I was absolutely TOTALLY dismayed to learn this was an '06 when the recipient of this gift opened their package.    Then I read a review and learned the quality of the product was poor also.  Enough...this was the worst purchase I've ever made.  
 I was really ready to like this product, because the book is charming, and the presentation of concepts is good.  It appears quite kid-friendly.  However, the sound quality is the pits.  It sounds like an old inferior analog recording put straight over to disk.  My opinion is that this is a defective product 
 I brought this book because of its high rating. It disappointed me. It took me two days to read this book without learning anything. My previous SEO experience is 1 day's of reading on the internet.   I would give this book higher score if it is only 20 pages. It is just too wordy -- a waste of time and money.    
 Although this dvd was supposed to be in very good condition, it had a serious scratch that prevented my little boy from watching the whole movie. It's one of his favorites, so we're very disappointed. 
 a bunch of yada yada to fill the pages. I will be giving my book to charity. all it is, is eating natural foods and a very expensive line of his vitamins. gimme a break 
 I really wanted to like this novel.  It had a clever name, an amalgamation of the Great Schism that separate Catholicism and Protestantism, and Matrix, like the movie with the same title.  (Note: the novel is pronounced Shiz-mat-rix, with a short a, rhymes with schematics).  A classic cyberpunk title.  However, this novel is anything but user-friendly.  I don't know if pharmaceuticals are needed for appreciating this novel, or if the author used them when frantically writing, in between vacuuming the roof of his house and such.  The novel moves at such a frantic pace that within one sentence the entire setting can change and this happens more than a few times.  It's difficult to know the point of the plot; perhaps that life is worth living.  The novel is a cross between Heinlein's Time Enough For Love, Bester's The Stars My Destination, and petting a sea urchin.  In a shocking act of consideration, the publishers have included all of Sterling stories related to the Shaper-Mechanist War.  That would be the full length novel, plus five stories.  The stories were written before the novel, which was the order I read them in, although after reading the novel last, I can't say whether or not to recommend reading in that order.  The stories are interesting and enjoyable.  In fact Sterling seems to excel with his short stories.  His story "Flowers of Edo" is where I got interested in his style.  I would recommend his short stories, but this novel is another matter.  Humanity has balkanized into a number of factions, with the Shapers and Mechanists being the most powerful.  The Shapers have reshaped their bodies genetically.  This includes such drastic things as replacing all the E. Coli in their intestines with enzymes.  The Mechanists are like the Borg of Star Trek, they use mechanical prosthetics to enhance themselves.  If you think the Mechanists are the cleaner of the two, think again.  Cockroaches and bacteria are prevalent in Mechanist environments.  Every five years the Mechanists need to have the bacterial growth scraped and UV-burned off their skin.  That's one thing prevalent throughout his writings, this sort of creepiness.  Expect more of it.  However, don't let the war make you think this is some majestic good vs. evil epic space war.  Battles are mostly low key.  There is lot's of narration and dialog.  Sterling self-claims his crammed prose.  No kidding.  Adjectives rule supreme in this novel; as many as possible are crammed into each sentence.  If one would do a histogram of adjectives, this novel would be on the far right tail of the bell curve.  Here's an excerpt: " He always wore his spacesuit, [something something], and [multiple length modifiers] body odor came through its [multiple adjectives] collar with [multiple adjectives] pungency."  Sentences like this go on and on and on and on and on and on and on throughout the novel.  And there's no shortage of hyphenated words, like long-fermented, eye-watering.  On one page, there were no less than 11 hyphenated words, plus one triple one.  Similar to the prosthetics of the Borg, the sentences themselves seem interchangeable.  Here's another excerpt of a dialogue: "What was your brigade? I'm no Cataclyst. I have your weapon here. Constantine pulled a ... vial from his ... jacket ..." You may as well interchange your own sentences: `The tree fell in the forest; it made no sound' or `the space ship went into orbit; it's boots were muddy.'  Give it a try. It'll make as much sense.  There are times when the novel seems profound.  I would find myself backtracking at times to understand some point, and I would go back 5, then 10, then 20 pages to try to understand something and would just give up and go back to where I was.  It's hard to say you read this novel, it's more like your eyes glance over the words, and on occasion you absorb some of it.  Since the novel fluctuates from the profound to the mundane an average of 2-1/2 stars seemed appropriate 
 I was disappointed with these tongs, which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils.  I agree with other reviewers, it is difficult to grasp and close them.  Unless you have a rather large hand (which I don't), you're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel!  When comparing these to my 12" tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16" tongs no different from the 12" ones.  
 Hate to break it to you all, but the film is not even close to the true story.  The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY.  His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.  Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter.  Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses.  Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts.  This thing was nothing more than a fictional story.  It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have "USA" applied on them anywhere.  I could go on and on about it, but hey, at least now you know so you are not like so many who are saying "yeah, this is TRUTH!!"  So be sure to do your research, and don't believe everything you hear even though you really, really want to 
 I think this book is okay but as many reviewers have said the math is a little lacking.  While math is important to economics, it isn't necessarily for the math's sake that that is so.  Incorporating both the math and specific examples utilizing math really clarifies the theory.  I found myself confused about what microeconomic theory meant when there wasn't a lot of numerical examples to back it up.  There are far better text books to get a really thorough grasp of microeconomic theory, but if you already have that fundamental grasp I think this one might refresh your memory.  But I would recommend others if you are looking to learn the theory for the first time 
 If you are a serious artist or student of art, this book is almost a complete waste of time. Drucker's flowery writing is pretentious and difficult to follow, and in the end she has little to say. She also needs a new editor; There is a typo on the first page! (I believe it's "and and", but I don't have it in front of me) I also find it frustrating that she has no typographic sense. I took an undergraduate class about artists' books which featured her book. Several design students joked in the back of the class that they shouldn't have to read the book on that basis alone. (These are undergraduate students, not people who are writing books about the art and design of BOOKS.) 
 I got this device to connect two laptops and two desktops, to one screen and one keyboard and mouse. The Mouse is a Microsoft Intellimouse, and the keyboard is a MS internet keyboard Pro, none of these devices work with the IOgear CS1764. I have to plug my mouse and keyboard on the back of the CS1764, to be able to use them, but lose all the keyboard short cuts functionality. Also after some hours the USB devices plug on the back are not available to the my windows or linux OS, requiring me to unplug and plug the devices again 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I bought this for my 6 month old daughter, all she does is just look at it , you can hardly hear the sounds and she gets bored prteety quickly 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 Perhaps this book should have been titled My Life Raising Bettas to Sell to Pet Shops.  It is more interesting as autobiography than a reference.  There are only seven pages of basic betta care.  The majority of the chapters are related to breeding and raising bettas for a pet shop market.  The section on fin forms and colors and color variations would make a handy basic reference---if it had pictures to illustrate the descriptions.  It does have a lot of color pictures and the captions provide some of the most concise and interesting information.  If you have an interest in economical fish raising and selling, this book has information for you.  Don't buy it as your basic reference, do buy it for the pictures 
 This book is written by someone who clearly has no medical background and is unable to read and interpret research clearly. There are an incredible number of inaccurate statements. Following this kind of advice could kill you. It's the kind of book that perpetuates myths and does not help the cause of women anywhere. Terrible book 
 After Pamela and her son are abandoned by her boyfriend, she decides to use the knowledge of criminal activities she gained from him for her own benefit.  Changing her name to Carmen to reflect her new, tough-minded business persona, she opens an escort service and then gets involved in the drug trade.  She keeps intending to leave her new lifestyle when she has enough money, but when she does try to change, she finds that it is harder to back out of than she thought.  The beginning of the book is written in a dry "how I succeeded in business" style - since this novel is supposedly similar to the author's life, that is probably why.  There is also no editing, which makes it harder to read.  There is some attempt to develop the character of Pamela/Carmen, but she usually talks and thinks in clichés.  The secondary characters are not developed and are rather interchangeable.  Her son is never given a name.  At one point she shows up at the funeral of someone who used to work for her escort service, and is introduced as "someone who tried to help her".  Help her how, by supporting the lifestyle that eventually killed her?  The ending of the book is no surprise, and elicits little sympathy for the narrator, since she thinks so little of the consequences her actions will have for herself and others 
 I read this collection of life stories and events with an admitedly negative attitude toward it because of my dislike of the first book of this collection.  Nevertheless, I thought that this volume was even worse than it's predicessor.  I don't believe that this book has any literary value to it at all.  It most certainly didn't make me feel better about my life.  Personally I believe that these events are things that happen to everyone in their lifetime.  Merely reading about them AGAIN had even less appeal to me than it did the first time 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 This particular slant on Catullus is not my favorite.  The editor really seems to aim this book at those who have extensive knowledge of the Classical Languages. (some of the commentary is in attic greek)  I am a high school student taking AP Latin who was given this text by my teacher because the book that I am supposed to be using is backordered. It takes me on the average twice as long to translate with this book than when I borrow the text that I should be working off of.  (The Student's Catullus, by Garrison)  Catullus, by Fordyce is not for the average student of latin, rather for the average latin teacher 
 This book is short and poorly written and I didn't find to be so extremely inspirational as everybody else writing reviews on this site. In Fact I found it to be boring and pointless. This book about a religious nut who thinks he is some sort of modern day jesus didn't impress me at all. I reccomend that anyone thinking of reading this book should reconsider. Altogether, this book was just a steaming pile of garbage 
 My daughter tried to set up her account and it said her code was already in use.  In other word, someone probably stole her code.  So no costumer service help for a month now.  Still waiting for a return phone call.  All I got from email was the run around.  I have a HUGE family.  This is something I would have gladly given as gifts and recommendations because I know it would be fun.  But now I feel totally dissed!  They took my business and then pooped on it 
 The architecture depicted in this book looks nothing like the example on the cover. It's more of a colonial feel , instead of the contemporary tropical that I hoped for 
 NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES ARE FAKE!!!!I WAS CLINICALLY DEAD FOR 6 AND A HALF MINUTES. DURING THAT TIME I SAW NOTHING. AFTER DEATH YOU CEASE TO EXIST. NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE STORIES ARE MADE UP SO AUTHORS CAN MAKE MONEY ON PEOPLES FEAR OF DEATH. DONT SUPPORT THESE CON ARTISTS. 
 even if there were on option for 0 stars, i'd still have to consider giving this movie 1 star.  only because sarah michelle gellar is in it.  she's the only decent actor in the movie, which is never scary, never suspenseful, and completely lacks a plot.  it re-creates the scare scenes of the original "grudge" only they're not scary this time, because we don't care anything about the characters going through it.  a horrible waste of time, and this comes from someone who really appreciates horror films, even bad ones.  this movie made "the ring 2" look like a really good, really scary movie.  skip it.  don't waste your time 
 I was disappointed greatly with the contents of the book. Hoskin and Gingerich peddle the old Eurocentric view of astronomy. Short shrift is given to the views of scholars such as R.R. Newton and Dennis Rawlins. The presentation of material is very shallow, and the tangled web behind the advances of Kepler and others is not presented. It is like whitewash 
 I have tried to order twice from this company.  The first time I waited over eight months and cancelled the order.  I accidently ordered from them a second time, but when they mentioned a delay, I looked them up.  Do not order from them 
 The heat from the original machine warped the plastic replacement pitcher during the first use.  The pitcher is now unusable 
 Terrible, awful, without exception the dullest album I have heard in a long time.  I hadn't heard of this woman, but was recommended to listen to her because I like Diana Krall.  Personally I fail to see any connection between the two.  This is appalling stuff, not a single song raises itself out of the mire of dire musicianship and lack-lustre moaning.  Its one for the bin 
 This is a fairly short book, and can be read in one or two sittings.  It is very easy to read, and sort of enjoyable.  On the down side, this author spends too much time trying to vilify Plato and Aristotle, resorting to a very unlikely idea that they conspired to bury Parmenides' ideas, and/or make it look like Plato was his true heir, rather than Zeno.  As other reviewers of this book have pointed out, they would have had no motive to do so.  Since this book is so short and easy, what the author could have done is spend a lot more time supporting his ideas rather than just stating them as fact without convincing evidence.  Or better yet, he could have chosen to just focus on the mystical importance of Parmenides' writings and just avoid the conspiracy theory and trying to rewrite history altogether.  This is where I have the most sympathy for the author:  I believe he may indeed understand Parmenides' writing from a mystical point of view, and in some ways this is why his writing style is passionate.  For this reason I almost gave this book three stars; but I couldn't do this because this isn't the only book about the underworld initiation or "dying before you die"; and yet the author almost acts like it is or like he's discovered something nobody else has.  If passionate and mystical, the author's style could also be described as lurid.  He almost seems to act as if the discoveries are too amazing to be believed, narrating as if he's telling a children's story by continually using rhetorical questions like "And you know what they found next?".  He suggests on one hand that people of european descent who are interested in the east are neglecting their own heritage, and then claims that we are indebted to the east and there is a conspiracy trying to cover that up.  Actually, every book I've ever read on Greek Philosophy states that the Greeks took significant portions of their ideas from the east.  At one point he mentions a memorial (constructed about 500 years after Parmenides was alive) of Parmenides which gives him a title that fits with his theory, yet when he points out that the face couldn't have been Parmenides' (on a statue of Parmenides) but it was a generic face, he overlooks that.  In other words, he uses the evidence when it fits his theory, and excuses it when it doesn't.  The people who constructed the memorial could have been mistaken about his title and it's implications since it was centuries after he lived.  I think that if he focused on writing a book of mystical importance, rather than getting caught up trying to overthrow the establishment philosophers and rewrite history, he'd create something a lot better.  He seems to forget that Plato also, was a mystic, and had received the underworld initiation.  Even though universities focus mainly on Plato's secular writings, his mystical and esoteric writings are there.  I still feel like I want to read this author's other books, if for no other reason than because they are kinda fun, and to write another critique 
 While few can sincerely argue against the assertion that in many ways the American educational system is in crisis and that serious scholarship must be devoted to righting the wrongs in this system, the 2004 Brookings Papers do very little in the way of concrete and viable options to fix these wrongs in the system and instead offer much in the way of obvious conclusions, such as that good teachers help students to learn more (I'm not kidding, folks). Serious discussion of options like charter schools, reform of the way teachers are certified, and voucher programs is bypassed in favor of rhetoric about improving the system without any concrete ideas of how to go about it. Another thing that I found disconcerting about the work is the way in which much focus is placed on improving the education of socioeconomically disadvantaged students, while ignoring the needs of any other type of student. On the whole, this collection was uninformative and painful to read and I would advise anyone with a choice in the matter to avoid it at all costs.  
 I was disappointed in this book.  It detailed the thoughts of women turning 60 who had many advantages in life, in terms of education, family help and encouragement, the luck to connect with the right mentor at the right time.  I would have been much more interested in the thoughts of less privileged women, more ordinary women.  I couldn't help thinking that it may be easier to have a positive view of aging if you are already a woman of accomplishment by the time you hit your forties.  For some, the greatest accomplishement of their lives may be successfully raising a family, completing an advanced education later in life or simply a life devoted to volunteerism. I'd be interested in their thoughts.  That's what I thought I was getting, at least in part.  A nice mixture of women from different socio-economic groups would have been most welcome 
 After reading about 130 pages I began to feel like I had already read this.  It reminds me a lot of The Corrections, though not as depressing or interesting...or good.  The parents--the children and their individual perspectives and lives and then a lesbian affair.  It's all been done before in The Corrections (and various other novels, come to think of it).  It's boring, really.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and even though I'm nearly finished with the book I still feel that they are two-dimensional.  The Thea and Anne affair was so predictable--a sure sign of a mediocre book.  I am only bothering because I have book group next Tuesday.  I wouldn't bother if you really enjoy a well constructed novel 
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods.  I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms.  I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self.  When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience.  This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.  This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 After falling in love with Gourmet's yellow cookbook, I subscribed to Gourmet, hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary.  Wow, what a disappointment.  I have just received my second issue and, as another reviewer said, it is about 90% ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars.  The 6-page "Special Advertisement Section" stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue! What happened, Ruth Reichl?  The few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking. For those cooks looking for a great cooking magazine, I highly recommend Bon Appetit over Gourmet: the majority of the magazine is recipes and cooking tips, with only interspersed ads.  I will be calling to see if I can get my subscription switched tomorrow. 
 Let me see if I have this straight: The author suggests that women who CHOOSE to stay home and raise their kids should have the same kinds of benefits that those of us who go out every morning and MAKE A LIVING while also raising kids have rightly earned? There is an answer for the problem that the author cites: GET A JOB OUTSIDE THE HOME. 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 be careful with this video if you have any neck, back or shoulder problems 
 Wow.. to start with I had to turn on English subtitles to watch this movie in English.  Even then it was hard to puzzle out what was said in this film half the time.  I'm not a big fan of Spike Lee films - they're too stereotypical and portray people in a negative light. 'Clockers' could have been a gripping detective story while also exposing the drugs and violence which black youths find it so hard to escape from. But that isn't enough for Lee who stuffs his film with so many half-developed ideas that it becomes tiresome to watch. Lee seems at one point to be commenting on the influence of violent music videos and video games, but when he fails to develop this line of reasoning, it's clear these sidetracks are only a means to fill the film with his intrusive visual fireworks. Many scenes serve no dramatic purpose and the bloated film is a good deal longer than it needs to be. The is just like the old gangster movies of yore, the endings just seem too unbelievable to what was shown before. And just like that you get a mediocre movie 
 I got this book last Friday.  I'd read The Birth of the Firebringer years ago and had been looking for the second and third book in the trilogy ever since.  I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this second part of the trilogy.  Aljan is dragged out to sea and winds up in the land of the two-foots without memory of who he is, knowing only that he must find the secret of fire.  A good concept, but poorly pulled off.  Pierce loses the sense of magic and adventure that was such a big part of the first novel.  It's also much darker than the first and third.  You don't really feel like it fits at all with the other books.  The only places it ties in are the beginning and end.  It feels more like an interruption than a continuation of the original story line 
 But over the last 10 years it has just become another "muscle" mag that uses T&A to prop up its "bodybuilders".  I'm surprised its still around 
 nice recordings but veer away from the broadway sound and into popular music of the 40's and 50's. Some tracks are awful. Bing Crosby singing (warbling) Younger Than Springtime? Please!! Anyone who's heard Jason Daniely in the recent Carnegie Hall concert version, will never be able to accept any other versions 
 This Russo collection of short stories didn't really work for me. I love his books like Straight Man and Nobody's Fool but I just couldn't get into this outing from him. It could very well not be Russo's fault, I tend to have issues with short stories in general 
 Briefly looking through this book you can quickly see that it is not a technical design book.   It does a very nice job at praising various popular magazines, and it does highlight fundamental design practices within magazine design.  It is a good overview book. It is also a good book to see many images of successful magazines without having to hunt down various magazines.  However, the problem is the book does not going into the technical process of magazine layout. Magazine layout IS a very technical process that most books don't explain. There is much about the grid - it is extremely important and very under estimated. It is also more simple than most people would think. There is also much about magazine layout and structure this book will not cover. Also about the whole process, from layout to print. There are a MILLION questions and problems that pop-up while designing a magazine. Many considerations and variables that vary. This book does not bring up any of those.  Can you design a magazine after reading this book? No. Can you evaluate and understand magazines better after reading this book? Yes. Can you get a feeling for what magazine design is about after reading this book? Yes. Can you get some great ideas out of this book? Yes. ...you can also get them by looking through quality magazines 
 this product does work, BUT it has to face the sun, so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning, not in the afternoon, it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the TV ad. Also they are hard to place with powered windows 
 It wasn't easy to follow. I didn't keep my interest, I just flipped through and read what I wanted. Not so good 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... hel 
 Why did they have to produce this album.  From start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear.  This was a severe disappointment.  Even more disappointing then Eve.  At least Eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste' for not so with On Air.  If you're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise don't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd's out there.  I, unfortunately, own the cd and have listened to it many times and I can't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album.  That is if there are any.  
 I cannot review this item since I have not received it so far at the shipping address I gave Amazon when I did the purchase. I bought four items, and I only got two of them by mail. What happened to the other two items?  -Apple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger, Travel Adapter & Cable (Purchased on 09/15/2006)  -KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs - The Spark Plug (Purchased on 09/15/2006)  WHO KNOWS.. 
 The advice for exercising and breastfeeding is wrong. It says breastfeeding hurts. It is out of date. It quotes that study that purported to show that exercise made milk taste bad/be less good for babies, and then recommends a complicated regimen not feeding that milk to your baby. It treats formula feeding as a reasonable strategy, despite how dangerous formula is for babies. It urges very tight, compressive, supportive exercise bras for breastfeeding mamas, and does not allow for the probability that might lead to plugged ducts/mastitis in many women.  The duck squat line drawing is laughable. In addition to not showing a form of the squat that would allow for a pregnant belly, it shows a woman in a very deep squat, with feet flat on the floor, not leaning forward and not holding onto anything or supported at her back. Physics sezs: Not Possible!  Overall: mostly useless, pretty dull, unhelpful if you exercise out of doors by engaging in interesting activities. Get Aneema Van Groenou's book instead 
 This idiot believes he can write, but he is very good at using big words that makes him think he is intelligent, but he's not! He sounds stupid and he doesn't have a clue what he is talking about! Of course, none of his readers do either!!! He is obviously a fan of Johnny Depp's (aren't we all?), but that's the nicest thing I can say about Mr. Pomerance. Sorry 
 I have a BS in electronics technology.  I know alot about digital electronics, but RF frequency is something I know little about.  This book is definitely not meant for a beginner to the RF world.  I am totally lost 
 I can fully understand the bad reviews given about S. Beauty. (not as bad a 1 or 0 stars)  Eric Bruann's songs here may not be the best, but his voice & guitarmanship is worthy of hearing.  The cd to buy from this area of IB (74-75) is clearly Sun & Steel, a very good cd that contains 2 of the best IB songs I ever heard: "Beyond The Milky Way" & "Watch The World Goin' By" 
 This vac is an absolute hunk o'Junk!   1)It over heats and turns itself off (after only 10 minutes of vacuuming) and it will not restart for at least 45 minutes.  2)The dust cup or containment compartment is MESSY and difficult to empty, when removed it creates a huge dust cloud over the waste basket.  3)I am convinced the replacement filters for this machine do not exsist, I have found not one retailer who sells this product that carries the filters. 4) And as for trying to contact Euro-Pro, the maker of this marvelous machine, you can let the unit cool while you are on hold with customer service 
 According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's 
 I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.  The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.  The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.  I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.  I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work 
 I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed 
 I'll admit I haven't yet finished this book.  I find it rather diffiult work.  Almost an act of faith in itself that by the end there will be revelation.  I'm not a religious person. Although Jimmy doesn't constantly bring up religion on every page, it does feel as though he does.  Hammering home Christianity, evangelism, fundamentalism and so on gets a little tiring for me.  If America has a moral crisis, it's more likely to be caused by religion than solved by it.  I don't need to believe in 'God' or 'our Saviour Jesus Christ' to have morals and morality. His heart is true but his message will probably only preach to the converted.  On the book itself, it's poor value.  Poorly made, thin, doubled spaced type and a reasonably large typeface.  I wonder what the wordcount is 
 A dreadful movie depicting men as macho s#$! and women as tarts.  This was made in an era when people wore revolting tight stretch denims and hung out in pool halls and bars.  It was also made to capitalise on the popularity of Patrick Swayze who had just appeared in the over-rated 80's teen musical "Dirty Dancing".   A very pointless movie is "Roadhouse".  It does not deserve a bare bones DVD release let alone this new special edition.  Is there really a market out there for rubbish like this, or am I the only one with taste in movies 
 In a nutshell, this book stinks.  It's more about the trials and tribs of a 30-year-old in a dead-end job in New York than it is about Julia Child or cooking or food in general.  And the whole book is larded with profanity which serves no purpose, except perhaps to bolster the author's hipster creds.  But at the end of the read, where are we?  Roughly the same place we started, except in need of a shower.  Because of the book's great potential, I think it's fair to call the book a huge failur 
 I did not expect it to be so child like, I thought it was better. I guess is good for a kid but I got it as reference book. I am sending it back  Thanks  marineus 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 Ok let's be honest, this was [bad].  It was not powerful, or anything else one of the other critics exclaimed Sinch to be. It was pure and whole-heartedly [bad].  I guess if you like depressing dribble from a band that has enough money to not really care about the things they write then this is for you.  Maybe I'm just an old fasioned punk but aren't lyrics supposed mean something other than "my life sux sooooo bad" 
 Received this book and found the inside to contain a book on diet and nutrition. Based on my understanding of the description, the contents would have covered Assertiveness training for women.   Stange 
 This is a collection of essays - some good - and some are so stupid and childish that I couldn't get passed them and I gave the book away - I couldn't tolerate having it in my house!! 
 The first time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 5 stars.However, this book is the least accurate of all the Lucy book I have read, and I have read a lot.  While I was reading it, I noticed that some of the things Mr. Brochu said about Lucy directly contradicted with her autobiography. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I went to Luie Arnaz's website. She distinctly said that this book was not accurate at all and to skip it.Then everything started to fall into place. This is as much of a cartoon of Lucy's life as anything. Yes, it's touching, but what good is touching if it's not true? Everytime I think about the fact that Mr. Brochu so plainly lied, it infuriates me to tears. If you want to know the REAL Lucy, skip this book. Go staright to her own touching, candid memoirs, "Love, Lucy.&quot 
 Before I picked up this book I knew that it was written by a ghost writer, posthumously. But since it was a "sequel" I wanted to get it anyway. What a waste of time! It is obvious that Harold Robbins had jotted down some notes and ideas and someone with no talent whatsoever had tried to make it into a novel. It is fairly clear to distinguish some of the passages that are Robbins' and then there are those that he would be ashamed to even look at. There is actually a part where the same sentence is repeated, with two words changed, on the next page. The intensity of characters, the eroticism, the storytelling that are so evident in most of Robbins' work is nowhere to be found in The Secret 
 I felt more sympathetic toward the hookers and sex workers in Km.0 and the porn folks in Fluffer than I did with these sad, scheming, nasty theives.  They basically drive their uncapable third partner to suicide by being really hateful to him (even though the father "loves" him.)   The only decent character is the young man they recruit to replace the ailing man, who, turns out, has a thing both for women and men.  In this case, father and daughter.  It could be interesting, but it's lost here among the artificial-feeling grittiness and endless series of theft attempts, which pass for story.  Bascially, I didn't relate to or care much about the characters, who didn't have much redeeming value, and who didn't learn anything during the movie.  And they are all really bad to each other.    There are lots better choices than this. 
 I read the stock reviews and then the readers' reviews and could not agree more with Mr. Hauer's reaction.  I cannot understand how anyone who reads very much could tolerate this poorly written book.  Undoubtedly, Mr. Thomson is a font of knowledge on film history, but he needs a writing class badly.  I threw the book down at p. 181.  Try this on for size:  "No doubt, esteemed Renaissance painters and eighteenth century composers were able to carry on their work without distraction.  (All they had to worry about was Inquisition, plague, or sheer loss of favor.)"  The book is full of bizarre, inaccurate rumblings like this - - and that's before you figure out what in the world this weird aside has to do with the history of American film.  A good editor would have advised the author to reduce his dependence on convoluted sentence structure, entertain simple declarative sentences and reduce this mess to a meaty magazine article at best 
 Robert Stone, one of my favorite authors, has written a novel which is clearly unworthy of his great talents.  The book has a thrown-together quality, as one improbable incident follows another.  I will not reiterate the plot, as so many other reviewers have done this so sucessfully.  But I have to agree with the consensus:  the characters are not fully developed, and their motivation is unclear.  It almost seems like Mr. Stone just decided that he wanted to write a book that was exciting, frightening, and sexy.  Start with a sensitive family drama, then add a little in-the-know power politics, a near death experience while searching undersea for lost emeralds, some terrifying Colombian drug dealers, and end with wild voodoo ceremonies and the wreckage of his home life.  What have you got?  That's the question.  
 This toaster looks great, but it is incredibly slow, much slower than the cheapo toaster I owned before this one.  It takes 2-3 minutes for a piece of bread to toast.  It does seem to toast evenly, though.    It features a removable crumb tray, but the "shell" of the toaster is one piece, so there is still a solid bottom beneath the crumb tray.  If crumbs fall off the crumb tray they are trapped at the bottom of the toaster.  I have a couple of large crumbs stuck in the bottom of the toaster that I cannot get out.  Fortunately, they do not burn or smoke when the toaster is in use.  I would rate this toaster high on looks, low on performance 
 I was excited about this DVD because of the customized workout feature, but I couldn't even make it through a preview. The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine.  If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed "Yoga Shakti" by Shiva Rea 
 This was a disappointment obviously generated to cash in on Franken's previous blockbuster on Fat Idiot and Notorious Bush Water Carrier Limbaugh. I struggled through about thirty pages before I started feeling scammed. Then again, the title hints at why this book is so spare and uninteresting 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend. 
 I don't mind using bisquick or jiffy mixes but packaged soup mixes and canned soup have so much sodium.  I'd have preferred to see use of fresh ingredients, they don't take long to prepare 
 I absolutely adore Alicia Keys and her phenominal talent.  I enjoy listening to her rich vocals and emotional buy in to every song she sings.  BUT, the arrangements of these songs are so WRONG on this recording, it was a humongous distraction that I could not get past.  It felt like I was hearing some of the songs for the first time; not something I was liking.  Nearly every song was dipped in a jazz tone, which certainly did not accentuate her R&B style.  The background vocals were too funky at times and the supporting band was anything but smooth.  One plus for this album was it was Alicia Keys after all.  I'm glad to hear her perform, but just not these arrangements.  This CD will either gather dust on my shelf or be eBayed, sad to say.  Bottom line:  Even die hard Alicia Keys fans may have trouble digesting this, soley on the crummy arrangements it brings. 
 I, like the others, bought this DVD thinking it was a legit CD (I've seen the word unathorized used on videos before and thought it was just part of the name) with interviews, backstage material, and good music...instead I get a very disappointing knock-off. When I got home and took the wrapper and stickers off of the package it had in very small print on the back that the people making these DVDs got no permission from Nickelback or the producers (which means the band makes no profit) Why is this even being sold? I thought that kind of stuff was illegal 
 Some of the recipes are healthy, some are a good way to get quick sick. If it were just J.R. and his recipes and food pics, okay, but no, on the cover is a picture of two famous women who help glorify violence and who act lascivious in front of the world and on the cover. This book glorifies the WWE, and the WWE glorifies violence and sensuality. It's also an insult to women. Anyone claiming to be a Christian, do not support this book, don't be a hypocrite, "Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect." - Jesus 
 After reading reviews I had imagiend this book to be a master piece.  After received I was simply not impressed.  Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding.  A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion.  None were that breath-taking.  You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi 
 The Prisoner of Azkaban  Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of "Star Wars", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.  The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls "The Invisible Man". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]  Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. "Harry Potter" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class? 
 I thought - cool - this is just what I need to start up my home recording studio with my Mac. Unfortunately, author Ben Milstead has nothing relevant for the Mac user and in fact discourages potential computer buyers against the Mac. All the "hands on" uses the Windows operating system and Sonar software. Nothing for the Mac user here. If I would been aware of this beforehand, I would have not purchased the downloaded version, instead opting for a more friendly Mac book. I think the description should have mentioned the non-Mac slant. The other half of the book I can use is good, but I feel I got only half my monies worth. The old adage of "Buyer Beware" is still one of importance in the digital age. Mac users stay away from this book, as I am sure there are better alternatives for us non Windows users out there 
 When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo 
 I predicted in 1994 that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan wouldn't stand the test of time. It was all the rage in 1994 and I still can't honestly tell why. With its painful --- and I mean painful --- bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy, it seems to be little more than someone's "artsy" home movie.   I agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive, self-obsessed, women-children.... That was big in the 1990s but I think it's changing. (In fairness to the film, I can also appreciate that GO FISH was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry.)  What makes this film ultimately fail, in my opinion, (aside from the acting) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young, urban lesbian ghetto. Almost all of the characters' issues, views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny, specific demographic.    There are a few crossover fans out there, but I can't imagine too many Midwestern, middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate. As a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out: "Why would I want to go see some grainy, black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives don't remotely resemble my own?"  The normal answer to that question, of course, is: because it's an interesting story with compelling characters. However, in the case of GO FISH, neither applies. There's not much of a story and frankly, you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it.   Watching this film is like seeing someone's 10 year-old home movies --- bad cinema, bad entertainment.   
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 I bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it. I have a Mac Pro running the latest version of Mac OS. I installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution, which is kind of silly in this day-and-age, but that works OK. What does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes. Pretty unworkable. Don't bother buying this for a Mac 
 I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed 
 I thought for sure I would enjoy this, but I found myself looking at the time and wondering when it would be over.  Stowe is good as are the others, but the story just did not engage me 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Sweetie, written and directed by award winning filmmaker, Jane Campion best known for the film "The Piano" is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship. One day the womans mentally ill sister Dawn "Sweetie" breaks into their house and lives with them. She is not on her medication and creates havoc. When her father visits after his wife leaves him, he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful.   It is never mentioned what kind of illness Dawn has. I thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it.  The DVD has some great special features. There is a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, audio commentary by director Jane Campion and director of photography, Sally Bongers and screenwriter Gerard Lee. There are interviews with lead actresses, Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston. There is a 1989 conversation between Campion and film critic Peter Thompson made after the success of her short films.   Finally, there are 3 of her short films made as a student. The first film, An Exercise in Discipline: Peel, is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive. The son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up. The second film, Passionless Moments; is a series of short scenes about various situations. The third film, A Girl's Own Story, is about schoolgirls who do various activities.  This film is ok but is not appropriate for children 
 This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.  Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable.  The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles.  There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain.  Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever.  This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing.  As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment.  
 I read this book prior to bringing it home to my son to ensure it espoused the values I would want him carry forward in life.  To suggest to a young child that Blue Sky and Sunshine will carry you through challenged times is simply setting them up for disappointment.  While the rest of the family was showing strong character and work ethic Frederick was a lazy day dreamer that made no contribution.  If he had worked along side his family in preparation for winter they would have had more fuel for their bodies and straw to keep them warm.  Essentially he became a burden on his family and could only share mystic thoughts of yesteryear while his siblings and parents starved themselves during the dead of winter.  
 I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table 
 I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it.  In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you.  I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe. 
 I first viewed this movie on cable, that same night, I purchased the movie from this seller.  To date, I have had no responses to email, no communication what so ever, and still have not received this tape in the mail.  Very disappointed, and not recommended to purchase from this seller 
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GUIDE TO HELP DETERMOINE THE VALUE OF YOUR COLLECTOR BICYCLES, FORGET IT! THIS BOOK HAS VERY LITTLE PRICING AND NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WHAT ONE WOULD CONSIDER A PRICING GUIDE. SAVE YOUR $ 
 Is this shampoo or sap??  What exactly is it supposed to do??  I received a sample of this shampoo and I am ever so glad I got to try it free before I actually spent money on it.  Not only did my hair feel like straw, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was so heavy I couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo.  I'll save this one for Halloween.  
 WWE's Kane (aka Glen Jacobs) is a serial killer hiding in a burned-out, dilapidated hotel, where 8 delinquents with two officers from their detention home arrive to clean up the place as community service. The kids get killed one after another in a most horrible and painful way, but to call "See No Evil" is a slasher film is a bit misleading because the killer has a strange penchant for digging out the victims' eyes.  You can add a few more things to this plot summery, but basically this is all you see in this film. Many reviewers have rightly pointed out that "See No Evil" has borrowed many ideas from other horror films or complains about the stock characters and their creaky dialogues. Yes, I know, they are right and I must add that all these teenagers might be petty criminals, but they surely deserve better fats than being forced to swallow THAT (see it for yourself). No, to me the most disappointing thing about the film was something different. That is Kane, the star of the film.  What part of this film did executive producer Vince McMahon find attractive? It is clearly made for Kane, but it takes too much time for him to take over the center stage of the film and even then his character is not very impressive, or is at best campy. We are repeatedly shown the uninspired killing scenes that are neither horrifying nor darkly funny. The simple repetition of gruesome deaths is actually a pitfall for any horror films (as in `The Hostel"), but this is exactly what I find in `See No Evil." Perhaps with professional actors who know how to play killers (like Kane Hodder, Tony Todd or Robert Englund) things might have been different. As it is, in spite of the pretty good opening, fine cinematography and production designs, the film becomes boring halfway through the story 
 I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : "Sail to the moon", "Nice dream", "Creep"... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.  The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers. 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done 
 Contrary to the title, I found the book more on the theoretical side. Lots of classifications with questionable practical value. The examples are high-level ending up with more classifications. Same observation about the simplistic figures. Chapter 13-The World Wide Web gives an introduction of the initial Web requirements, while Chapter 16-J2EE/EJB explains general ideas about EJB. My benchmark for an "solid" book, with somehow related topic, would be "Design Patterns" by Gamma,Helm,Johnson,Vlissides 
 I purchases this book after reading the other rave reviews.  It does include some interesting words, and I really appreciate the examples of usage in a sentence.  However, for the person who is searching for creative wording, the book does not offer a large selection of choices.  This book might be a nice supplement to a substantive thesaurus like Roget's, but don't expect it to be a great reference.  Personally, I wish I hadn't spent the money 
 This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.  Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today 
 Your typical, average, unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn't like. Not only that, People that don't like him. That don't love him. This whole things has been done to death and I'm sick of it. Enough with the killer's in masks. Many others have come before this one. Some where more entertaining than others but still, give it a rest already. Nothing is done different and everything is flawed in this movie. It's a complete waste of time.  Here's a list of all the others that seem EXACTLY similiar to this undying tune:  1. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER 2. I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER 3. SCREAM 4. SCREAM 2 5. SCREAM 3 6. HIGHSCHOOL DEATH 7. THE ENTIRE JASON VORHEES SERIES 8. THE ENTIRE MICHAEL MEYERS SERIES 9. URBAN LEGEND 10. URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT   fINAL vERDICT: This deserves to be forgotten 
 First album very very good both voice and instrumentals. However this time round the voice was good but the instrumentals were dry and very dry and didn't do her voice justice at all making the songs...........just different. Nothing close to her first album. Hopefully she'll go back to her original style that we all came to know and love 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 While most of the content of this book is helpful, it is a religious-based book "undercover."  The farther I got in the book, the more I felt that their own religious beliefs were in the way of their professionalism.  My respect for their ability to include all people's freedom of spirituality dwindled with every page.  If this is the kind of book it is, Authors, that's fine, but don't sneak in your own religion without advising your readers 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 The notation can be hard to follow if you don't have a grasp or natural incline for statistical regression.  Steps are hard to come by in some problems because too many steps are skipped for a beginner.  It is almost necessary to have at least a basic statistics background before reading this.  Even though I had a background and had read ahead, I had to depend on my professor to truly understand the material at all.  If your professor has an accent or goes quite fast, and if you don't have classmates you can work with, using this book alone will be more than painful.  I would suggest a supplement such as "Using Econometrics: A Practical Guide (4th Edition should suffice) [Hardcover] by Studenmund" if you are just beginning to learn about regression 
 The underlying plot is good. Mr Feist brings likeable characters that develop over time in credible ways. If this were a stand-alone book in another setting it would be better.  This story fails when it starts foreshadowing the upcoming serpentwar. The biggest flaws are Pug and Tomas, the major characters from the prior series.  Both are incredibly powerful. Both have very strong ties to characters in this story. Both inexplicably do not involve themselves in the events of this story. Of course we know why. They are far too powerful and would trivialize the entire "adventure". But it is ludicrous that either Pug or Tomas would allow events to unfold without interfering directly. Pug's adopted family is involved. Tomas's parents are involved. Their birthplace is involved. The excuses that are given are paper-thin. The idea that neither of them keeps an eye on the town in question stretches credulity past breaking.  If this story were consistent with the prior series, it would be 3 pages long. There would be the attack by the bad guys foiled by Pug and Tomas, followed by a thorough retaliation by Pug and Tomas on dragonback. The end. Obviously not a good story, but when you have god-like characters, you have to explain their absence, especially if you start blowing up their home town and killing their family 
 To a city dweller since their early teens, City Life proved to be interesting reading for me.  With respect to content, Witold's work is brimming with detail.  Despite making his home in a land full of impressive  cities with teaming skylines, Witold nonetheless gives European cities the  credit they deserve.  No sentence seems to be spared as trivia, analogies,  historical fact and fiction pour out of the pages like traffic down a busy  street.  But this is a one way street, since what City Life has in the way  of content, it lacks in direction.  Witold does not really lead us anywhere  in City Life.  Each chapter expertly discusses concepts and components of  an urban existence, but there does not seem to be a larger argument.  Every  book should encourage the reader to draw their own conclusions.  The  problem is, Witold's is not as strong as it could be 
 The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there 
 Like many other people, I bought this book on the overall rating given by other readers.  To say I was stunned and disappointed is an understatement.  I have been following a celtic spiritual path for many years and druidry for some time now.  I have read countless books on the subject and found this to be one definitely not worth reading if you really want to follow the druid path.  Take other reviewers' advice and take a look at John and Caitlin Matthews or better still, find a local group and learn from experience.  This book is really not worth your money or time 
 Caveat - I wasn't exactly expecting to finish PE a die-hard believer.  That said, I was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors' willingness to believe anything, and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity.  According to legend, the US Navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during WWII.  Not simply invisible, the ship actually teleported from its berth in Philadelphia.  However, the little-understood process played havoc with the crew - even after the experiment's end, some crewmen would "blink" in and out of existence, become frozen in time or catch fire.  One man walked through a wall, never to be seen again.  Of course, the Navy denies the whole thing....  While the legend places the story during the dark days of WWII, the legend itself began in the mid 1950's, with the publication of "The Case for the UFO" by Morris Jessup.  (Aknowledging that Jessup is no scientist, Berlitz & Moore nevertheless refer to him as "Dr. Jessup".)  Believing that propulsion of UFO's (and perhaps future human spacecraft) lay in solving Einstein's "Unified Field Theory", Jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area. Jessup's book caught the attention of Carl Allen (AKA Carlos Allende), who spent the war in the Merchant Marine.  In a series of rambling letters Allen insisted that Einstein had solved UFT, and the solution was successfully used to cloak a USN warship in wartime experiments.  Though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter, Allen goes further than detailing his observation - exhaustively describing the travails of the crew, Einstein's seeming retraction of UFT, his admission to Bertrand Russel that UFT was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after WWIII, the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project, and that UFT had anything to do with the experiment.  To get his point across, Allen/Allende even forwarded a copy of Jessup's book (heavily annotated with his own theories, many having nothing to do with the Philadelphia Experiment) to the Office of Naval Research.  There it piqued the personal interest of at least 2 officers, and slowly became the story-that-wouldn't-die.  A few years later, a depressed Jessup was found dead in his car.  Allende/Allen became something of a cult celeb, sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed, often warning against the ominous dangers of UFT even as he seemed to beg others to look into it.  Berlitz and Moore piece Allen/Allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  Instead, the result is far less than the sum of its parts: Berlitz and Moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow, and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you'd get in a jigsaw puzzle.  Nothing in PE lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide.  At the beginning, and towards the end of the book, the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment - but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out (Allende at least included his Merchant Marine ID in his letters).  The authors add to the puzzle, but never actually establish that the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  An anonymous radar scientist, who doesn't claim to have worked on the project, clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true.  Another scientist - given a psuedonym because it would upset "the status quo" - describes wartime discussions on a project that we're supposed to believe developed into the Philadelphia Experiment.  Named "Rinehart" after a similar character in the novel "Thin Air" (a thriller inspired by the legend) the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment, nor any discussions of its aftermath - obvious details for such a pivotal figure.  "Rinehart" never even mentions Allende, even though it had been Allende's letters that clued the authors into Rinehart's existence (under yet another pseudonym).  The authors never explain how they managed to find "Rinehart" - they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is, and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book.  The authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in "electrogravity" never caught on despite their apparent success - suggesting they were suppressed.  Though Allende described reading stories about the Experiment's sailors in Philadelphia newspapers, the only article that could be found is obviously bogus: a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar-room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish -  but no mention of date, newspaper, or the reporter, nor any specific facts in the article about the event, like the name of the bar or those of witnesses.  The authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise, and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle, without explaining how one piece corroborates any others.  Though appearing critical and objective, it's impossible to believe that the authors haven't already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred - they explicitly question Allende, yet never express their doubts, let alone attempt to deal with our own.   But what's the danger of that?  I mean, who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the "Philadelphia Experiment".  Unfortunately, "Philadelphia" feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies, and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting - never a positive thing.  Worse, it's not even interesting - barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story. 
 I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content 
 The cover is very pretty thanks to Penguin books.  BUT..  this translation is seriously lacking in elegance.  Trust me.  Look into buying Robert Fitzgerald's tranlation or my personal favorite -Samuel Butler's tranlation.  They are far more poetic and descriptive than Robert Fagle.  I recommend picking up two translations and comparing the same few pages from the same chapters.  I honestly don't know why Robert Fagle got such high praise for this.  Take my advice and get Samuel Butler or Robert Fitzgerald's translation.   
 Great info for the desert gardener, but if you want to know what the plants and cacti actually look like, the small black and white pictures just don't cut it.  Gardening is a visual discipline, pictures do speak a thousand words 
 It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.  Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together 
 First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced. Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the "Joe College" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company 
 This book could've been much bette 
 While this vacuum is easy to use, it loses suction after only 6 months. Don't buy this to waste money. 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 I bought this book so that I could easily figure my caloric and nutritional intake with a pocket-sized book that would be easy to carry around. Unfortunately, the lists in here are unwieldy and overloaded with burdonsome amounts of data on pre-packaged foods. Why would I need this information from a book when it is listed on the package itself? Because of the pages and pages of info on frozen entrees and chain restaurant food, it is difficult to impossible to find out, say, how many calories are in 3 oz of sirloin steak.  I recommend instead Lavon J. Dunne's Nutrition Almanac, 5th ed. It gives charts of basic foods and their nutritional content, including vitamins and minerals, in far more detail, as well as a glycemic index chart, chapters on nutrition and health without bombarding a person with the latest diet fads, and charts on daily nutritional requirements. Plus, it is fully indexed, so you can look things up more easily. The only plus I can give to The Complete Book of Food Counts is that is might be useful for people who eat out at chain restaurants, since it has menus for some of them. 
 I love Gary Null's radio program. It's so inspirational that I bought this book hoping for more of the same. Sadly, I found it one of the worst organized books I ever seen, badly edited, and full of pages and pages of superfluous "testimonials" (literally over fifty pages of insubstantial fan letters!) I'm sorry to write this because I am a fan of Gary's and appreciate what he does on the radio but I feel compelled to warn the prospective buyer away from this book 
 Whatever you do, do NOT buy this film. This is not Drunken Master 1 or 2. As a matter of fact Jackie Chan isn't even the star.(he's only in about 5 minutes of the movie.And, that's a clip from another movie!)The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the film has mediocore action 
 I was reading A Short History of Nearly Everything. What took me by surprise was the claim made by the author, Bill Bryson, that the Saturn V rocket's blueprints were destroyed years ago.  My initial reaction was shock, so I researched a bit online.  Wikipedia and NASA's website claim the story behind the plans getting destroyed was urban legend.  It isn't like the book was written a long time ago; 2004 seems recent enough.  I stopped reading it.  If an author can not get their facts straight or make a valid represenation of the story, then why read them 
 I used this book to shop for furniture in the High Point area.  It was useful in locating stores and in knowing what product lines each store offered.  There are two main problems I have; (1) I think the savings are overstated - it is probably more in the area of 20 percent off, and (2) I think the author was uninformed or else very soft on rating the customer service side of things.  The salespeople treat you like family (as stated in this book) when they are trying to make the sale, but for me, that was where the good customer service ended.  I bought almost all of my furniture at Rose Furniture.  They were very helpful and responsive until after some items arrived damaged.  That is where all the competence and responsiveness ended.  If you read Ms. Shapiro's review of Rose Furniture, she only talks about how wonderful the sales people are - she offers no information about treatment after the sale.  I think this is a huge oversight.  What you want in a furniture retailer is good service - this is all they do.  They don't build furniture, they service the customer.  I waited 5 months for my order to be delivered - Rose estimates an 8 to 10 week delivery timeframe.  Rose Furniture would consistently tell me something that just wasn't true.  After waiting 5 months for my items, one of the items would not even function properly and was covered with some dark, gummy substance - all over the finish.  I refused delivery and I'm seeking a refund.  Rose Furniture has a condescending way of dealing with people that is very aggravating.  They have a pleasant exterior appearance while all the time they could care less 
 the reviews lured me into buying this book-reading it made me return it--the recipes mentioned on the book back cover are NOT in the book. It is not worth the 17$ it cost(that includes the shipping)- I will be more  careful in the future about depending on the book reviews 
 yes this is a book about friendship and i realize for child at times simple is better but this book i thought really lacked especially compared to how great a book the hungry caterpillar is(i personally think just about this authors best book)it has at the very start of the book the question ask by a mouse "do you want to be my friend?"and then at the end a yes from another mouse no other writing between yes you can teach your child a little about the other animals the mouse is apparently asking though not in print.I personally thought this could have been laid out a little differen 
 I was very disappointed in this book. I was a foreign language teacher for many years, and even I was put off by the use of technical grammar explanations! I bought this for an 11-year-old girl who is fascinated by manga, hoping to interest her in Japanese language learning.  This was definitely not the book for such a purpose -- its description should make it more clear that this is not a book for young learners 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest 
 OK. If you're going to create a pictorial accompaniment to a controversial movie, AT LEAST PUT IN THE BEST PICTURES!!!  "The Passion of the Christ" intersperses stills from the movie with snippets from the passion section of the gospels. But whatever its value as a devotional or meditative aid, it is missing nearly all of the over-the-top images from the movie. There's no snake in Gethsemane; no clear image of Satan; no Jesus hanging off the bridge; no demon children hounding Judas; none of the nastiest scourging scenes; no long stairway to ascend with the cross; no shroud image on Veronica's cloth; no flipping Jesus on his face; no shoulder dislocation; no eye-piercing crow.   Virtually none of the images that stayed with me from the movie are included. I wonder why not? Were these scenes too gruesome when transferred to the printed page? Or were they rendered silly when they could be studied at leisure? I can't figure out Mel Gibson for adding these gruesome scenes to the film. I understand less why he left them out of the book. Weird 
 Women in Love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve.  To its great credit this Ken Russell film is faithful to the D. H. Lawrence novel upon which it is based 
 A good book, but not a great one.  The subject fascinates me so when I see a book at a discount bookstore in Philadelphia w/the title Stigmata I pick it up.  The title and the cover intrigued me.  However, Harrison does not break any new ground here.  He uses modern day examples of people who have been given this gift from God.  He explains the migration of the stigmata from Europe to America.  There have been several instances of people from the U.S. with the stigmata.  He also touches on the recent phenomena of other Christians besides Catholic Christians receiving the stigmata.  The book is very easy to read and is neatly broken down into titled chapters so if you don't want to read about "cases from the past" you can move straight to "cases from the present" without losing anything.  In other words you can read chapter six before you read chapter three and not get confused.  He does have an interesting chapter on how the medical profession views these phenomena.  He sites papers authored by medical doctors on spontaneous wounds and not just the stigmata type.  Doctors do not have an explanation.  People under close medical observation have spontaneously received scars or burns for no reason.  Very odd.  He mentions "blushing" as a very small example of this where an intense emotion triggers a visible physical response.  I gave the book only two stars because it didn't go into any depth on the subject.  I enjoyed parts, but for the most part I knew this stuff prior to reading it.  I get a little annoyed after I finish a book and realize I didn't learn anything from it 
 I think i must restate my previous review- how long have you been listening to metal? (and paying attention to song structures? 
 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
 I bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult. The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun, education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's fun for all ages 
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 What a scam.  While some of the principles in this book are based on truth, it is scandalous that a doctor would abuse his role in order to make a profit. Most of the strategies he claims will give miraculous results are truly just a waste of money with a tiny grain of truth at the center.  While it's true one should get enough vitamins (centrum will do just fine) and use good products to care for skin (drugstore ones are generally just as effective, and in this case more-so), using his products & strategies can only help you by convincing you to do what you already know you should - keep your face & body clean & healthy.  His brand line is a waste of money & does not even reach the status of "ordinary" 
 The updated Fiend Folio is nearly as disappointing as the original book, although the art is admittedly better.  The Monster Manual II is far superior in terms of content.  Technically, the book is a match for any of the other excellent 3rd or 3.5 edition products; in every other way, it is considerably inferior.  There are a very few creatures which are both innovative and interesting, such as the neutral aurumachs, which provide a middle ground between the fiends and celestials, and the nerras, strange mirror creatures from the Demiplane of Mirrors.  However, in this book there are quite a few creatures that are just basically boring (really, how many different kinds of carnivorous flightless birds can you have? And there are also at least 2 creatures in this book which fall into the category of 'big bovines with sharp horns' -- mere filler, since there is nothing unique about any of these things) or that continue the unfortunate trend in recent D & D supplements of adding the freakish and just plain gross to the game.  The revolting appendix on fiendish grafts and symbiotes is a case in point; it is alright for a scabrous 'dungeon-punk' or pseudo-horror campaign, but it's utterly useless for a high fantasy game in the tradition of Tolkien (and I like to think that there are still a few around); the crawling head is also utterly disgusting, and there are many other creatures of a similar kind.  The bottom line: if you want to turn your game into an "Aliens with swords" game, then buy this book, call in Sigourney Weaver, and prepare for new explorations of grubbiness and grossness; if you want a high-fantasy, non-scabrous game, steer clear -- there are only 6 or 7 creatures in all that fit a non-horror style of gaming and these are ones you can live without 
 The author of this book, Warren Wagar, is apparently a professor of "Future Studies." I certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. "A Short History of the Future" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so WRONG, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. Orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this.   He shows barely any creativity in his "predictions" and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. The fact that he assumes the Soviet Union will continue plodding along well into the 21st Century is incredibly naive. The fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. Did he read the newspapers? Did he pay ANY attention to that Gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing Russia down?   And honestly, did anyone really expect that Germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal?  Or that Latin America and Africa would remain dictatorships forever? Or that black rule in South Africa would not occur until 2014?  If this book had been written 30 or 40 ago, it would be excusable. This book is just sloppy. He doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. Everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. Like "and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose." That sort of thing.   The author is clearly an "ivory tower" academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry Marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague "trends." The fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.   
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 Don't make the mistake of judging the entire Hard Case Crime series by this lackluster entry.  I can imagine the publishers being overjoyed when Stephen King agreed to write a novel for them and then cringing when they received this manuscript.  The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.  (Don't let the cover fool you!)  It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.  There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.  This one's for Stephen King completists only.  
 Hated it. Read 45 pages. Aimed to read 75 before throwing in the towel, but couldn't make it that far. Not funny. Not clever. Not even especially entertaining. 
 I have every single album that Weird Al has ever made.  And I am not impressed by this one at all.  It lacks variety, and is overall boring and not creative.  I enjoy white and nerdy and weasel stomping day, but Close But No Cigar and Trapped In The Drive-Thru (waaay too long) are just crappy.  And Pancreas?  WTF? 
 As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase 
 I was disappointed with this version of Beauty and the Beast, as it does not have much action, and definitely does not have the fun that the Disney version provides. My 3 1/2 year old gave it his best shot, but it was very  boring and we all decided it was a waste of time. The characters do not  grab you, and as a matter of fact, they are somewhat unlikeable. This in  itself is a put off, but when the beast finally appears, you think, okay,  it's going to get better. NOT...Stick with Disney 
 I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead 
 What a disappointment this is, after the superb Pitt and Monk detective novels set in Victorian times.  Someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer:  (1) She repeats information not once but many times, apparently having forgotten that she had already said that; (2) The plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow.  For example, the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed Sebastian, and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn't look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master's abode.  And lo, there it was, wrapped in a cloth and stuck, barrel down.  To prove(?) that it was the fatal gun, the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry.  What?  Say that again?  In short, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere just don't measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of London, circa 1880+.  Rather than go into this series, the reader would do well to go back and read the Victorian books.  That's a sorry suggestion, and I'm sorry to have to make it. 
 A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case).  
 Current scientific understanding of cortisol's role in stress, disease, weight gain and so on is useful general information, even if it doesn't tell specifically how to endure and surmount the stress of modern life. However, this information is conveyed much more effectively in other books such as Sapolsky's _Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers._  The distinctive feature of _The Cortisol Connection_ is that it tells you what to do about excessive cortisol secretion. Unfortunately, what it tells you do to is complete baloney. A few of the many nutritional supplements he recommends -- magnesium, for example, might be mildly helpful for a few people who have bad eating habits and don't take conventional vitamins and minerals.  All the other recommendations for nutritional supplements lack scientific foundation. Any author can just make this stuff up. Then another author cites the first author, a third author cites the second, and a fourth author cites the first, in a round robin of nonsense. Then other authors claim that these multiple citations prove that the value of such supplements is well-recognzied. This kind of pseudoscience stinks to high heaven, and it makes modern life more stressful than it must be 
 This book is just not informative. I am not trying to be ugly but I beleive black women really need to be more informed about hair care than this. I dont think it is purposely done. I truly am not sure if he really knows some of the problems about our black hair.This is really close to my heart and I feel compelled to speak out. Get Cathy Hose or Carolyn Gray they have valuable info about taking care of our hair and tips to start a healthy regimen. Sometimes you have to change to get good results and I am proof. 
  Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter 
 Don't waste your money - this book contains misleading and incorrect information!  There are so many wonderful books on toddler development, don't waste your time with this one!  The author's have a very narrow mind and only give answers that support their idea on how to parent as opposed to addressing the range of normal development and issues that parents face. 
 This book is 289 pages and could have easily been 50.  By page 80 I was bored and not interested in continuing.  If you have a college education, or even remember fifth grade arithmetic, the first 40 pages are insulting.  From page 40: "To figure out how much your average electric bill is, add up your last twelve monthly payments to the electric company and divide by twelve."  No kidding.  Page 38 explains that to determine your annual income, you multiply your monthly income by twelve or your biweekly income by 26.  The cover proudly advertises that the book "features 70 worksheets!"  This is because there is a seperate page for what you spent on monday, tuesday, wednesday, etc.  There are worksheets for monthly expenses, where each month has its own worksheet.  I know I did not have the patience to write "cable bill - $x" on twelve different pages.  I found "the pocket idiots guide to living on a budget" to be much more helpful.  After reading this tiny book, I have a working budget and feel totally confident that I will achieve my financial goals.  I got nothing from the "everything budgeting book. 
 Is the United States a Christian country?  Well, not if you believe our Founding Fathers, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin.  They argued for complete separation of church and state.   And Wills is actually quite good at telling us what Madison, the most important of them in this regard, said.    But America does have plenty of Christians.  And Wills claims (in 1990) that polls show nine out of ten Americans believe in god.  As a Polytheist who regards such a belief atheistic, I find that a discouraging statistic, but that does not mean it is untrue.  Wills also argues that an atheist (who does not believe in any Goddesses or Gods, not even the monotheist one) would have no chance of being elected President (presumably being a candidate without a prayer).  Given what Adams and Jefferson said about Christianity in their letters to each other, I doubt that either of their positions would get them elected today.  Wills discusses the issue of the words in our Pledge of Allegiance, including the reference to the monotheist god.  I do think symbols are important.  Our flag does not have a Christian Cross on it, and that's intentional.  And I do not understand either side in this dispute.  Do the Christians really want to be on the wrong side of Madison's arguments and demand that Polytheists refer to the monotheist god?  Do non-monotheists really want to appear unpatriotic by refusing to salute their own flag because of these words?  The author then moves into the debate over Darwinian evolution.  And he contrasts William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial not so much with Clarence Darrow as with H. L. Mencken.  Willis is quick to criticize Mencken's completely politically incorrect attacks on Women, Jews, and Blacks.  Well, maybe I am just too tolerant.  I agree that Mencken's style was like Nietzsche's.  But I find their works thought-provoking rather than parts of a demonic theology!    Wills then claims that the real winners of the Scopes trial were not the Darwinians.  He is right about that.  After the trial, the quality of American biology textbooks went way down.  Wills says "it was not Scopes that put evolution in the schools, but Sputnik."  That is true.  The author then argues in favor of putting creationism into the science classroom.  I am disappointed with Wills for wanting to do this.  We're not talking about a ritual Pledge to our Flag here.  We're talking about teaching falsehoods in science classes.  Shame on him!    There is also a discussion of Jesus, including the virgin birth, miracles, and resurrection.  By the way, I have always thought these made Jesus less heroic and more attackable.  After all, without any of this, who would dream of comparing Jesus with powerful people such as Stalin or Mohammed or Julius Caesar?  Jesus would be a simple hero and no one would find cause to demonize him.    Wills is not afraid to talk about abortions and a Woman's Right to Choose.  My only comment on this is to say that I can't see an argument for an embryo being sacred in the first few hours after fertilization, before we even know if it will be twins or not.  It is an interesting book, but the comments about creationist arguments are simply wrong.  Even if Wills is being sincere and merely in error here (rather than being reckless or dishonest), I can't give him more than one star for this book after that 
 Didn't see much point in carrying on reading after I got to the bit where the author presents the Naim-Andonian Volumes as evidence. By then I realised I had wasted my money on propaganda rather than a decent history book on a subject that interests me.  The interest started a few years ago when I read an Andrew Mango book and couldn't believe just how different a historians version of the massacres were from everything I had grown up believing.  From the books and essays I have read since (Guenter Lewy, Gynne Dywer, Gilles Veinstein, Eric Zurcher) I know that the Naim-Andonian papers were dismissed by the British 80 years ago when they were trying to find evidence and have since been dismissed as forgeries by just about every Western historian that has looked at them.  I don't know whether the author is incompetent or just dishonest, but I feel he should have been paying me to read his propaganda, not vice versa. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  (I'm never buying a book on this subject by an Armenian or a Turk again) 
  Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.  Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire 
 I agree with most of the negative reviewers about this, especially the one who pointed out that there were no "Mysteries". The criticisms are quite accurate: the tone is glib, condescending and jocular, what could be called Best Seller/talk show host prose: nothing too strenuous or meaningful. Bill Maher does the High Middle Ages. This is certainly the prevalent view: "nowadays, we know all about it". There is no sense of humility before a subject no one human could possibly understand nor of the feelings evoked by the great works of art of the era, compared to which the 20th century had very little.   
 This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing 
 Possibly the worst design for an armband.  A fifth-grader could make a better armband with felt, velcro, scissors and some thread.  Not only can you not see the Nano screen, or adjust the volume while you are running (changing the volume is like trying to text message with gloves on), but you cannot adjust the tightness of the band with just one hand, it has too little elesticity and too small a velcro strip.  To top it off, the Nano is kinda difficult to get in and out of the band.  
 Poor fit What you see is not what you get Quality not good  Very disappointing  Will not buy anything from the shoes manufacturer agai 
 A few good ideas that could have been a good chapter in another book 
 ...as my mom would say when I ripped myself off.  That's what I went for when I bought this.  Too bad that bad music, bad handlers, and commercialization got a hold of a legend and produce this disasterpiece 
 The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again 
 I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author.  In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally  all around.  We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws".  His errors are numerous.  He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution.  He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well.  Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement.  Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics.  He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse.  Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks.  At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion.  Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans.  None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla.  The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts.  He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates.  He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"".  He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is.  Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said.  From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction."  Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States.  If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book.  William Hal 
 This book is one of the many signs that the series is grinding down and that death is likely within a couple of seasons. The type of crass money grabbing that this cheap little fanzine masquerading as important character background (the bulk of the book are stills from the show itself) represents could only come from the obviously talented Mr. Ball when he realized that the jig was up and it was time to start wringing what he could out of it in its terminal stages. You need to be obsessed with the show in a very adolescent way for this book to be of interest 
 Let me start off by saying that I returned the book and never tried a recipe.  I was stunned by how mundane and unsophisticated the recipes are.  The cookbook reminded me of one of those fundraising cookbooks put together by schools and churches where everyone contributes one recipe.  The reviews were so good I was expecting something exciting and innovative but instead it was filled with dishes that are as common as dirt.  If you own Fanny Farmer you already have everything in this cookbook.  I grew up on Buzzard's Bay in Massachusetts and I was looking forward to some real New England favorites.  The clam chowder recipe was not as good as one I already posses and the author advocates corn meal on her fried clams.  No thanks.   If you are looking for easy recipes that may or may not be authentically New England this may be a good cookbook for you.  If you are a gourmet cook looking for sophisticated regional fare I say keep looking 
 I can understand why everyone would want this to succeed, but there are three reasons why it didn't. First of all, you would think Warner Brothers would learn from the reinvention of the Batman franchise they nearly killed. I always thought the target audience should be adults, and then would eventually make it down to kids. This kind of campy storytelling will not be tolerated by the public at large anymore.   Secondly, I felt there was some sentimental value attached to this film due to the passing of Christopher and Dana Reeve to not allow a more objective critique of the film. I'm not coming down on Brandon Routh at all. I think he did a wonderful job taking the Superman mantle. Aside from a few poor casting choices (Bossworth and Posey). The cast carries out very good performances. Not surprising was Kevin Spacey's marvelous performance as Lex Luthor. While clearly differing from Hackman's performance. Spacey offers a more jubulent take which adds more depth to the character.  And third, what made this film lose its cohesiveness was the direction of the story. Bryan Singer did a great job of re introducing the characters. But after that failed to take the movie in a clear direction. So in truth, you only need to see the first half of the film. After the second half you might end up scratching your head.  A shout to the people at Warner Brothers. You boys clearly don't have a clue wether you have a good thing or a bad thing so I'll make this real simple. Either hire a competent writer to tell a good story or sell the rights to make these movies. Superman is a good character with a wealth of material in the mythos to use. And it shouldn't be butchered by the likes of you. Take notice folks, Donner's films are going to out gross this one too. 
 No stars should be an option!  I picked this out of someone's trash bag on the sidewalk.  Which should have told me something about it, but I needed something to read on the bus.  Reading this was like settling for a candy bar you "kind of" like - you eat it, but it's not what you really want and it doesn't satisfy you.  I found it stupid, boring and pointless.  I threw it back into a trash bag when I finished it (yes, I finished it - once I start a book, I have to finish it).  I am not inclined to read anything else by her - I refuse to call her an author, because she can't write.  
 If you want this kind of information buy "The Good Old Days - They Were Terrible" by Otto L. Bettmann (a much better book about the same period).  I found Green's book chock full of information that is poorly organized and thus, difficult to read and remember.  Authors of this genre must find ways to make the facts relevant and interesting or the facts become (as in this book) just a dull regurgitation of horrendous human suffering. Reading the facts about "the old days" makes one appreciate the difficulties our parents and grandparents had just to live from day to day.  But there are other, better books that do this job than this one by Harvey Green 
 In it's time, I'm sure that this was a great piece of reference material. However, standards have quickly evolved past the information contained in this book. Sadly this is required reference material for my state's contractor exam - I feel better knowing that all licensed cabling contractors are tested on long outdated material 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 Only one reference Mr. Drummond        DID MUHAMMED DIE ON A CROSS FOR ANYONE 
 I just wanted to warn would-be buyers of this book that the copy that was sent to me by Amazon was about as old as the date it was published (1983).  It was appararent that it had spent a significant amount of time aging.  Perhaps the content in this book is still useful, but I found the condition of the book that was sent to me unsatisfactory, and had to return it.  I would be VERY cautious on your decision to purchase this book 
 This is a great idea, but the execution is very poor. The journal has different sections for you to list what books you want to read, favorite passages and more. But unfortunately every page is identical with a T-chart-like format, which gives you little space to write. For instance, if you're to write a favorite passage, the space to write the title of the book is the same width as the space allowed for the passage. Are you supposed to abbreviate? Or only include passages that are four words long? The journal doesnt include plain, lined or blank pages, so it's really only to keep track of books and book passages. The cover is the only good thing good about this journal 
 I'm a big fan of his earlier work, American Psycho--a very good novel and movie is fairly good with an awesome portrayal of Patrick Bateman by the new Batman Christian Bale.  This book had a lot to live up to...I mean it's not even a second rate Less than Zero.  Read about one third of it before I put it away 
 To those who have the revival cast album it is more than enough to have.    The additional/new CD which includes different songs recorded by various cast members is something one may opt to have but not a must.  The DVD though it carries intereviews with key personalities involved with the production is not presented in a interesting manner.I was expecting to see more clips from the show and not just a montage of the different productions edited as one song.  But over all what can I say- great packaging and marketing but NO JAZZ 
 My father fought from North Africa, Italy, Southern France, Austria and finally Germany. He was wounded 4 seperate times. Received Silver Star, Purple Heart and Bronze star. His 19 year old half brother was killed beside him. All that being said, he and his comrades that I interviwed almost never took these mindless Nazis prisoner. The stories that they personally experienced of their Nazi crimes were beyond human comphrension. I am disqusted that anyone would think of these creatures in any terms but the horrible instruments of a maligant society. I am upset when I read these glowing comments on this herrondeous organization. These same men in my fathers outfit had respect and soldier to soldier consideration for the regular German Verhmacht. This movie does little to show what they were really about, which is Death and destruction 
 A drawback of Calphalon's anodized alumninum is that it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher.  But stainless steel is dishwasher safe, and Amazon's product description claims that Calphalon's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe.  But if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line, it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent.  So it is "dishwasher safe" but you can't use dishwasher detergent. 
 This book is utterly awful. It is filled with fear mongering of the very worst kind. Reading this book made me feel terrible about even thinking about having a second child. The thesis appears to be that having another child will ruin your first born's life. I was weeping by the end of the book and felt utterly terrible. 
 As others have mentioned, the alleged discrepancies between standard BB cosmology's predictions and astronomical observation are rather out of date. For exampled, since this book's publication, high resolution CMB data has revealed the predicted fluctuations.  Other reviewers complain that BB cosmology is no longer conceptually simple, and hold this as a great flaw. One even appealed to Occam's Razor! Perhaps an analogy will clarify this: the Copernican, heliocentric model was quite conceptually simple. It's only failing was a lack of predictive power -- in other words, it's predictions failed to match observation. Kepler and Newton came along later and made more accurate predictions about the orbits of the planets -- with a more complicated model. In the 20th century, Einstein's general theory of relativity (a *very* complicated way of looking at the world, compared to Newtonian mechanics) provided even more precise predictions that correctly accounted for the previously unexplainable "anomaly" of Mercury's orbit.  William of Occam laid forth the idea that when choosing between two theories *that give equally accurate predictions*, one generally prefers the simplest. The choice between Copernicus' theory and Kepler's Laws is not such a case -- Kepler's Laws made better predictions. The choice between Newtonian and Relativistic mechanics is not such a case -- Einstein's theory is more precise.  Just because a theory is complicated, doesn't mean it's wrong 
 This was my first Val McDermid book, and as skilled a writer as McDermid obviously is, I'm not sure I can handle another one!  Serial killers seem to dominate crime fiction today, and TV shows like CSI have made extremely graphic blood and gore fairly commonplace.  Nevertheless, the truly horrifying serial killer in "The Mermaids Singing" (a title I still don't understand) and the frightening graphic descriptions of torture in this book will probably be giving me nightmares for quite some time.  Even the main characters, profiler Dr. Tony Hill, and Detective Inspector Carol Jordan, are depicted as seriously flawed individuals.  While I was rooting them on in their search for the serial killer nicknamed "Handy Andy" (another reference that didn't make any sense to me), I found myself wishing for a "hero" and "heroine" with fewer emotional insecurities.  I guess I like my heroes a little more heroic.  Instead of another Tony Hill - Carol Jordan story, I've decided to try one of McDermid's Kate Brannigan novels.  Hopefully, it will be a bit "lighter" and won't keep me awake at night 
 This "toy" is the biggest waste of money! When I got it, there were few reviews out about it.  It is very complicated to use and the web site never works and there is nothing to do on it when it does.  They should be repaying all of us our money for having bought this! Don't waste your money 
 I really like Levine's book Ella Enchanted. But I would not recommend The Wish for adults, let alone children. It is too vulgar 
 i tried to read this book, just could not do it,sent it to my sister, and she couldn't read it either. It is so confusing to begin with,you can't figure out what it is even supposed to be about,nor who is supposed to be who.   So sorry I bought this book.  Marjorie Morri 
 This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.  I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.      In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon.  
 Dragon Inn is soaked with political subtext, but manages to wind up a fantastic Kung-Fu epic... The East Is Red is much the same thing with regard to the politics, but the movie suffers for it.  Unless you really want to watch a bad kung-fu epic that serves as a metaphor for the handover of China, then I'd suggest staying away from this pitiful film.  Swordsman 1 and 2 are far superior and this film is barely a sequel.  Just pretend that only 2 Swordsman films were made and that this one was just a bad dream 
 Reading Larry Niven's thoughts on the publishing world in  "Playgrounds of the Mind" and "N Space" gives a good  insight into why this book was published: simply to fulfill a contract.  As  usual, the concept is very strong.  The story develops nicely and then ends  in mid-thought.  As an avowed Larry Niven fan, I was extremely  disappointed 
 I wanted this movie to be good, but boy was I disappointed.  I've seen home movies with more acting, plot and feelings. Parker Posey should be embarrassed that she was in it.  Save your money. The one guy is kind of hot so if you're looking for a butt shot, rent it and fast forward.   
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 My wife got this Cuisinart Classic Toaster oven as a wedding gift. We liked the appearance and had it on our registry. We used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well. Toast was perfect, and the oven cooked nice and hot. We broiled meats and made all kind of things in it. We found it hard to clean. We would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those, but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven.  Then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter. I glued it back on with super glue. It broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so I had to fix this plastic foot a few times.   Then another problem arose. The toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start. So to make toast we just used the un-timed bake function, but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast. Still we lived with it.  Then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working. So it does not bake. I think I knew this was going to happen because I would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever I turned the dial to bake for a while.   So therefore I think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last. I would have expected better quality. Considering how long we have been making toaster ovens, I think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls.  So like other reviews say, it does cook well and evenly, but it is hard to clean and does not last. If I were to have rated the product before the problems started I would have given it 4 stars. I wish that Amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality, because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products.   We are now looking into T-Fall Convection Toaster oven, but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts.  ______________  Since writing my review above I tried to fix my oven to no avail, but I have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke.   My recommendations are as follows. Since I know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this "Classic" model product can over time get dirty and stop working, I recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops, rice cookers, deep fryers, pressure cookers, or kitchen sinks. Especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease.   I recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls, which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location. This might make the unit last longer.   The newer Cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem I had. Or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways. Maybe 1.5 years is average life, or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction. Reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products. From the reviews and my observations above, I think the Krups models and the improved Cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me.  
 I have not listened to these songs for years. After listening, I was not too excited 
 Why on earth would anyone review this book? It would be like reviewing "Madeline in London". Who really cares 
 This book is almost like watching an episode of "The Real World." You follow a semi-interesting person around for a few weeks, watch them experience some amazing highs, some disasterous lows and lots and lots and lots of average ordinary daily humdrum. There is the a fiery girlfriend whom our subject waffles about. There are the odd and sometimes obnoxious friends who try to sound deep and sometimes succeed. There is lots of pot and alcohol to keep life on an even keel, if that is how you have to get by. And there is no real resoultion. Seriously, is the whole Judaic thing supposed to hold this story together? Is there some obscure Kabbalistic point to this mess? It sounds like there is supposed to be. There are hints of it here and there throughout the story. But it doesn't really hold up. At first I thought the book was just quirky, and I like quirky so I kind of got into it. And then there were really great flashes of brilliance in the events and the prose and I was like, "Sure, this is a slice of life story about, well, life, belief and the little things that keep us sane and keep us moving," and I got into that too. But then the story just kind of ends with no real resolution to ANY of the major plot points that are left hanging in the wind along with the reader. Seriously, and I will say this again because I hate when authors foist this on an unsuspecting audience, all of the big events leading up to the end that cry out for explanation and resolution and reprecussion are simply dropped. Is this a Zen ending? Actually the book ends where it tells you it is going to end about halfway through, with Alex doing the Kaddish for his dead Chinese father (who never converted to Judaism). The only problem is that Alex tells you over and over again that this ceremony means nothing to him. He doesn't believe in any of it. And through the prose of the final pages, not only does it not continue to mean anything to him, even in the act, but it doesn't even mean much to the audience who are listening to him go through the motions, including three Rabbis. No revelation. No change. Not even a bit of comfort for the road. Just a very flat ending for, as it turns out, a very flat book. The only thing I can figure is that this is some sort of morality play about how little religious belief truly affects our daily lives and who we are as people. In retrospect, it seems like reading this wasn't an uplifting nor a depressing experience. It was simply no experience at all. Hey, maybe that makes it Zen after all 
 I became aware of how important grids are when I was at art college and came across the first issue of a new design magazine, 'New Graphic Design' in 1958.  Published in Switzerland in English, German and French and containing dozens of pictures,  without a strict grid all the issues of this stunning publication would look a mess.  The grid, put simply is a framework which allows several elements (photos, graphics, text, display type etc) to be placed in a rectangle and all work towards one aim, clarity of presentation.  Virtually all publications use a grid (in its simplest form it could be called the type area) check out the page number position in a magazine, always in the same place defined by the grid.  Having used grids for years I'm surprised that there is so much confusion but that was before I read through Kimberley Elam's book.  The straightforward becomes the obscure despite the good intentions.  The most useful parts are the pages that use a see-through overlay, revealing the essence of the grid and nicely some disasters, too.  What could be simpler than the two examples shown on page thirty-eight and nine, Christof Gassner's 1960 redesign of one page of a theater program, from the dull and confusing to something so elegant and simple. What is really interesting about the page is that it is all done with type only.  Page forty-five uses another overlay for the contents spread of a book (designed by Drenttel Doyle Partners in 1988) the see-through reveals a simple grid but the actual spread is a complete mess with type everywhere, even the three words 'Table of contents' is letterspaced in two typefaces, roman and sans.  The two examples of the grid I've mentioned perhaps sum up the problems that a reader of this book might have, most of the European grid examples shown use the grid to simplify the placing of all the elements on a page, especially the typography. The American examples show basic grid versions that are virtually ignored when it comes to placing the page elements.  This becomes evident in the last pages of the book where thirty-four design thumbnails are shown, one would not know they conform to any grid at all as each example shows a mixture of display type, text setting and graphics in no coherent order, in fact the very opposite of what a grid is supposed to do with these same elements. Perhaps the key element in any publication grid is the size of the text and headline types, because these (especially the text size) remain the same on every page and other elements, photos and graphics, need to be positioned within the grid defined by the typography.  I think 'Grid Systems' is pretty hopeless in explaining the virtues of this essential design format and strangely there is a real dearth of titles about the subject, perhaps it's just a bit too narrow or technical for most graphic art publishers.  The great Swiss designer Josef Muller-Brockmann  had a go at explaining it in his excellent 'Grid Systems in Graphic Design' (ISBN 3721201450) though it's not mentioned in the bibliography of 'Grid Systems' but two of his other books are.  
 A poorly made documentary focusing on the problems surrounding the festival's producers. Every music clip in this film has been edited down, sometimes to no more than a few seconds, so the creators of the movie could slip in a few more of the countless interviews with hippie's proclaiming the freedom of the music and the show promoters worrying over how they're going to pay the musicians and beat the bad publicity. There wasn't enough room to include a single entire performance of any song by any of the bands featured, but there's enough room to show interviews with burned out hippies in their entirety, interviews that consists mainly of babbling or long pauses while they try...to...remember...the...right...words...man.      It's obvious that the creators of the film wanted to focus on the deterioration of the hippie generation, but if they were trying to make a statement, they were about 30 years too late. The only statement this film makes is one of frustation. The audience of this film will feel much like the flower children featured in the movie, caught outside the festival, trying to get a glimpse of the music they love through a fence that the people in charge won't let them through. 
 My 4-year-old son LOVED The Berenstain Bears' New Baby and it was a big help in preparing for the arrival of his baby sister.  So when we were struggling with remembering manners, I bought this book, certain that it would help.  However, I ended up disagreeing with the approach to correcting bad or forgotten manners and rude behavior.  This book outlined specific chores as punishments for various offenses. As parents, we have learned that allowing children to help around the house with things like sweeping, taking out the garbage, and helping Mommy empty the dishwasher (the plastic stuff!) is very empowering and makes kids feel like they can contribute to the household and they enjoy being part of the "family team" (hopefully this will continue into their teens since we've started them as toddlers!).   Also, I learned that I should probably read through any new book by myself at least once before sitting down to read it to my children (parents can learn too!).  Just a thought 
 This movie was so disappointing. It was completely different from the first movie AND all the books. Where in the world was Michael 
 This wireless access point worked well for about 2 months, but then it started to turn itself off & on sporadically. LinkSys tech support tells me that this is a normal behavior -- the unit might work for 1 hour, and then off for the next few hours, then again, on & off. I thought they would just replace the unit (since it is under warranty), but they wouldn't... they transfer instead to their technical support in India or Philippines... & would not replace the device saying that "when it doesn't work, it is a normal behavior... 
 THEY CALL THIS HEAVY METAL? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CATEGORY OF POP ROCK AT BEST. IF YOU LIKE GOOD HEAVY METAL/ HARD CORE LIKE MYSELF, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!! 
 Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut.  Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included.  The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic.  Work in 5 classes of 40-50 kids each day who can't read (many are moved up so they can be with their friends) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside.  
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 Chesler's tone is so patronizing here. Third wave feminists did not just step out of a cave, the older amongst us (those now in our later 30's to early 40's like myself)  saw these events unfold as children and it's throughly seared in our minds. Ms. Chesler ignores the fact that in the 1987 March for Reproductive Rights on Washington DC, in which 500,000 women marched, 2/3 were then under 30 years old (the third wave feminists, this was our first major- in numbers present, activist appearence) This book tempted me to write a letter FROM a young feminist. But I decided not to, because if Ms. Chesler was determined to ignore third wave feminists, despite much activism by us, a letter refuting her claims of our ignorance wasn't going to open her eyes. Readers are better to choose books by second wave feminists that are better written and informed, like Gloria Steinem's. I'd also recommend books by older third wavers like Naomi Wolf and Susan Faludi. 
 Amazingly bad prose combined with an anemic plot, an unsurprising denouement and fuzzy characters, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. It does absolutely nothing to elevate one's understanding of the forces at play that lead to suicide bombings in the Middle East. I had hoped to gain an understanding of those last-minute chaotic thoughts that rush through the mind of someone carrying out such a terrible mission, but this novel was a pure waste of time. Perhaps the worst element? His habit of rhyming within sentences which made me wonder whether his book had received any editorial guidance whatsoever 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 I cook almost everything from scratch, so I figured Home Cooking would be for people like me, who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines. Instead, recipes consist of packaged dough in a can, bottled sauces, etc. I don't need to read a magazine to figure out that I can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole! 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 I received this item as a gift and had to return it due to the plates being broken.  The replacement was sent, but the plates in the replacement were broken.  So I ordered another set that arrived broken.  Until the packaging changes, I would recommend choosing a different brand.  
 I know this film has some historical significance being the first British feature-length animated film and all, but to the modern viewer who has never had the privilege to read Orwell's masterpiece this film is a watered-down injustice due to the added humor in the story (I don't remember anything about a playful baby duck) and the tacked on "happy" ending.  Some other things that I found bothersome were the slow pace and the distracting humming sound.  Read the book instead, it's short and won't take you too long.  MTV will still be there when you get finished. 
 One of the reviewers below stated that admirers of Hurston "won't be disappointed" by this book. I beg to differ: I've read pretty much everything Hurston has written, and I think she is without a doubt one of the best American (and perhaps world) writers of the twentieth century. But "Seraph" was a great disappointment. Hurston simply overreached with this one. By the time I had finished reading it, I found myself wondering what the point of this book was. The story follows the marriage of a Florida couple over several decades. The husband is ambitious and forceful, yet also arrogant and sometimes violent, while the wife is timid and (overly) sensitive. Told from the wife's point of view, the problem with the story is that it essentially goes from a more or less realistic give-and-take between the two to an account of how she tries to prove herself worthy of her husband (there is little in the way of growth on his part by the way, e.g. he never expresses any regret for having acted like a brute during the early years of their marriage). Thus, "Seraph on the Suwanee" basically reads like a romance novel. It's true that anthropologist Hurston provides some interesting details into the lives of the "Florida crackers" (i.e. poor southern whites) in the early 20th century, but this is hardly enough to compensate for the novel's weaknesses. It's hard to believe that the literary genius who wrote "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (among other excellent books) could produce such a lackluster wor 
 The other day I have picked up the latest book by our first Turkish Nobel Laureate in literature, Orhan Pamuk. As far as one could tell, the decision to honor him with the Nobel Prize was largely based on this particular literary accomplishment. At least, when asked by reporters why Pamuk deserved the Prize, Professor Horace Engdahl, the very multilingual Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, kept referring to this book.  The book in question, Istanbul: Memoirs and the City, is a concoction of encyclopedic information, nostalgia-invoking monochrome photographs and the author's unsettling childhood memories. It could very well be crowned his worst work to date by readers familiar with the author's previous books. As I forced myself through page after page of what seems to be Pamuk's much distorted perception of his hometown, I can honestly say that his childhood memories sprinkled here and there were what kept me awake.  Just like in his previous works, a constant undertone of pessimism and hopelessness is palpable throughout the book, but his negativism is more disconcerting this time around as he unsuccessfully tries to ascribe his internal conflicts and his personal darkness to a magnificent town whose wonders never cease to amaze.   Owing to his affluent background and is uber-privileged vantage point, Pamuk's views are so dreadfully skewed that you might start believing him while he wholeheartedly describes the citizens of his version of Istanbul, hovering in a dream-like state of communal melancholy.  His imaginary Istanbul - with its decrepit buildings, filthy streets and rabid dogs roaming its dark, narrow, and decaying alleys - is not the vibrant city throbbing with liveliness that the ordinary folks, like his readers or the lower class Istanbullus for that matter, are able to perceive. His repeated use of the adjective dilapidated to describe certain aspects of Istanbul feels deliberate and malevolent.  As he paints this almost repulsive picture of Istanbul, he does not fail to rebut disagreeing views of European Istanbul lovers by telling them, "You need to live here at least ten years to be able to see it through my eyes."   Who are you to know what you are seeing?  Pamuk sees Istanbul as a fallen fantasy town where he is entitled to scorn poverty and the impoverished which uglifies what is rightfully his. He is visibly and unashamedly tormented as this city, for which he fosters a pathological affection, ignores his irrational expectations of conformity altogether. She continues to pulsate, breathe and change, remains jovial and full of energy, determined to enjoy whatever life throws at her as Pamuk watches from the sidelines in anguish.  Most disturbing of it all is his suggestion, maybe not directly but most certainly inferentially, that Istanbullus have no fight left in them. They have already lost the game and have made peace with the fact - hence comes the hï¿½zï¿½n a term he is trying a little too hard to coin - and are desperately waiting for the shoe to drop. (Hey, why not generalize this to the entire country while we are at it and reinforce the whole Sick-Man-of-Europe deal?) Pamuk's yearning for all things European and his dislike for whatever may represent the east is even more pronounced in parts of the book where he professes his love to Istanbul.  It is fair to say that Pamuk's work brought him very little acclaim in Turkish literature, and few if no awards. His writing skills have always been an issue of debate among his colleagues. Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion in Turkey about how his literary inelegance is magically lost in translation, how his sentences are invigorated and become more passable with some creative interpretation from his talented translator Melling Freely, as well as many proven accusations of plagiarism.  Until recently, Pamuk has been known to steer clear of politics. He has spent most of his career carefully avoiding political subjects, or approaching them only tangentially, with the calculated caution and slickness expected from bourgeoisie intelligentsia.   His abrupt and seemingly unnatural politicization began with Snow, his most politically-charged novel to date. His loving embrace of "all things political", unforeseeable as it was, tightened up faster than expected, reaching its peak with his astounding public statements regarding the killing of one-and-a-half million Armenians and thirty-thousand Kurds. This incarnation of Pamuk even claimed that he was the only person in Turkey who had enough cojones to broach these sensitive issues. Why the sudden change, you might ask yourself. I did ask myself, for one thing, why did the vanilla boy become interested in politics in his fifties?   All the publicity and buzz surrounding this "new and improved" Pamuk must have sounded like music to Pamuk's mostly English speaking allies and co-workers, who have done more than their share of P.R. for Pamuk's continued existence in European and American literary circles. These selfless allies have gone so far out of their way to promote this one specific author in such unprecedented fashion that it makes one wonder why.  Measly commissions they were to get from the marketing of Pamuk's books were so out of proportion with the amount of effort they put into hyping Pamuk to literary stratosphere that you have to ask why?  Did the promoters of Pamuk have an ulterior motive? Was the French Parliament's passing of the bill that criminalizes "questioning of armenian genocide" just when Pamuk's received his award a coincidence? Is European Union, which harbors this primordial mentality that does not stop at telling you what you can or cannot say but goes a step further and dictates what you can and cannot question, worth joining? Did people around Pamuk lure him into doing things that he might not have done otherwise by using the brilliant Nobel Prize as bait?  Was it worth it?  Reportedly, Pamuk's editor at Random House, George Andreou said in an interview in 2001, that if Pamuk were to write more politically he would have won a Nobel Prize by then.   This statement answered at least some of my questions 
 The beats on this record are repeatitive and the rhymes lack the creativity for the most part that you expect out of Kool Keith. This is a tough record to listen to in its entirety because of the thick monotony of the music.   The best songs are the Sex songs, and if that is the primary reason you like Keith's work than maybe its worth checking out. If you're looking for some of his new stuff to hear, I'd recommend Disel Truckers before the Lost Masters. 
 In laundry  " It smells like a locker room is not really useful".   Under paying for your meal..."What if I wash the dishes"?  The Italians will think you have lost your mind!!!  One does not say  "I am full" at the end of an Italian meal.  This book must have been written for a kid on his first back packing trip to Italy.  These stupid remarks take up too much space and much more useful  phrases could have been included 
 While this book presents clear theories and structural understanding of teams, the case studies are not the greatest testament to their validity. It makes one wonder how much fluff is behind the principles. This "older" book uses case studies from organizations heralded in years past, but which have now proven to be the world's most corrupt organizations. My personal favorite: "Deal-to-Steel" (appropriately named) a case study of teams at Enron, which authors state is "an organization built on individual accountability." These case studies of high performing organizations make one question the credibility of the research. Furthermore, the authors' record of consulting to some of the most infamous companies known makes me wonder if you'd rather pick up a book about securing your future by Ken Lay, or sound accounting practices by Andy Fastow. Now, the rest of the story... I did contact the publisher about the poor case studies when a group of students used the book for late night amusement and then heard presenters quote the pitiful examples before seas of laughing professionals. I thought the authors might wish to revamp case studies in future editions. The publisher agreed to contact the authors' representative. Months later, I received a complimentary copy of a new edition--same bad case studies, new cover and a higher price. Our company's bulk orders of the text immediately ceased. Good riddens-- it was dry reading anyway. 
 If you're just curious about what six-sigma is this is a good, easy to understand, book.  But it teaches you little that can be applied.    I'm in a company that is begining a six sigma effort and I am assisting the black and green belts in their work.  I had wanted a book that would help me do the things I would probably be asked to assist with such as building a SIPOC diagram.  Instead, the book is devoted almost entirely to telling you what the black belts do on a project (half of the 300 pages are about statistics and much of the remainder is about things like project charter).  The obvious problem is that a book like this can't actually teach you to be a black-belt. So after 300 pages I know some statistical principles, but not enough to actually do anything with, and I know nearly nothing about how to assist a black belt on a project.  Before you say "but six sigma is all about statistics" let me say that I know that.  Stats are the core, and doing them takes training.  You will not learn to do six-sigma stats from this book.  You will probably not learn much else from this book either 
 This book is full of good information, and I am a big fan of Dr Hatfield. But at times this can be a difficult read. It is like reading a text book and some of the workout applications are difficult to follow 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 My son enjoyed his leap pad for twenty minutes and has had no interest in using it since.  I thought it might be good for airplanes and giving him another way to practice his writing. It completely failed to hold his interest.  By far the worst use of money this year 
 I did not care too much for this book.  I closed it wondering if I perhaps missed the point of it all.  It seemed more like a character profile than a novel.  
 The reader didn't read my 2G MiniSD. I have another reader that does so I dumped the MobileMate and took the lost 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 One of the most boring book I've read 
 I went out of my way to find this book.  Boy, am I ever sorry.  Can I give this book zero stars?  This book contains all of the illumination of a 10 watt bulb.  Schneider's main environmental concern in this little text is global cooling!  Yikes!  Now he's an authority on global warming; so much for credibility.  Either Schnieder's an environmental schizophrenic or someone that lives at the public money trough.  The former hypothesis is the more paletable of the two possibilities.  This book is nothing more than the "nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind."  Don't waste your time.  The most positive environmental thing you can do is save a tree by using this book's pages as toilet paper 
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 After reading Jane Austen, George Eliot, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte, this book only tries, but never makes it to the 19th century period writing style. I disliked the fact that the author had to place us in this period, yet goes into the 21st century again and again with little nuances. What does a computer have to do with the people in 1867?  I do not understand how people could find a review helpful when the reviewer has given a book 5 stars. If you like the 19th century period, and is bothered by the way some contemporary novelist write, it is probably best to read the British authors of that time and forego John Fowles. I think Fowles tried to imitate George Eliot's Middlemarch by inserting certain quotes and passages from other books and Eliot's writing style, but Fowles has failed. This book comes out uninteresting and barely readable. It is amazing that a movie actually came out of this, and it is another wonder that people have actually liked this book enough to give it 5 stars.  I do have to add that if you are a woman, this book will definitely be offensive to you. The women are portrayed as manic depressive, innately hysterical, or terribly stupid and materialistic. Also, unless you are into 2 different versions of an ending, you would not like this book. Fowles may have thought that a reader would rather make up his/her mind on an ending, but I read a book because I want the author to give me a story. I do not want to have to make up my mind on how it should end. Otherwise, I might as well write my own book 
 The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.  
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 I haven't had such a bad time with any guidebook before. The authors seem to really dislike most of the places in this area, so almost put me off visiting a really nice town, and their restaurant research seems confined to the few standard tourist offerings and then a listing of fancy expensive restaurants. It's not difficult to find a good meal in France for 35 EU, any hotel can recommend one, we wanted the book to help find which was the best of the cheaper places. I saw a ton of restaurants in Marseille with menus 20 EU and under, but no clue which of them were good. Really disappointing, useful for the usual city maps and all, but the opinions for things to visit, eat, etc. not helpful at all 
 There is no clear organization in this book. Seems like they took many papers and at random picked paragraphs out of them. The only place they show organization is when they are introducing stuff in a chapter. Works as a reference book because you can look in the back and find the 6 or seven places your topic of interest is scattered in the book. but in general the gain of knowledge through the organization of this book is near to impossible. The authors of this book should be ashamed of themselves for doing such harm to Chemistry students 
 Littel has written a book about undercover agents that assume identities and personalities, called "Legends". The premise behind the book, and this may be kind of vague because I read the book several months ago, is that one of these undercover agents (or former agents?) is seemingly struggling with a personality disorder that obscures his reality. Not only does the character seem to have issues with reality, but the reader is left guessing as to the certainty of many of the vingnettes that are loosly slapped together in this plodding, oftentimes aimless read.   The story is not very gripping or believable. There are flash-in-the-pan moments where the author paints a comical scene in what reminds me of the incredulous, but believable style of Tom Robbins. On the other hand, the book tries desperately to take on this Tom Clancy seriousness that is totally unbelievable in view of its outrageous episodes.   Perhaps I would have enjoyed  "Legends" had I read it more carefully. I read the book for pleasure and escape from a life of reading impossibly dull legal tomes. So mabye, had I approached the book with greater diligence and less expectations, it is possible that I would have enjoyed it. 
 Boston have to be one of the worst bands EVER!! THE SINGER SCREAMS AND THEY MADE SOME OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS LIKE ROCK N ROLL BAND, AND THE HORRIBLE MORE THAN A FEELING. THEY WOULD NOT HOLD A CANDLE TO SMART BANDS LIKE METALLICA WHO ROCK! I JUST GOT METALLICA'S 4TH LP TODAY. GET AND JUSTICE FOR ALL BY METALLICA INSTED 
 I purchased this book on Ebay and even though I only spent $4 it wasn't remotely worth it.  I knew by the end of page 1 that I wasn't going to like this book but I forced myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better.  I finished the 1st chapter and tried to start the 2nd but I just couldn't take any more.  I was going to go back and count how many times she mentioned her religion or living in Silicon Valley but it would have been a waste of my time.  Only read this book if the constant whining about religion is something that interests you.  Me, it made me want to throw up.  So freaking preachy.  If I wanted to feel like I was in church I would go there instead of the beach.  Waste of paper.  I'm going to re-sell it but I feel sorry for the next sucker that falls for the description on the back which doesn't mention the holier-than-thou attitude of the character 
 This book is a joke.  For a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing, don't buy this book, unless you want a lesson in being ripped off.  This book is the size of a coaster, the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks.  It's made up to look cute; a two inch hardcover tomb, complete with dustjacket.  Misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget.  Aspects of investing are listed, but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks.  "A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted," by Peter Lynch.  Buy another one of his books (a "big kid" book), but not this one 
 ALL OF THE SONGS ARE BORING. I HATE THEM. THEY ARE SLOW AND BORING AND THEY MAKE YOU WANT TO FALL ASLEEP 
 When they say "For Dummies", they mean it! Don't waste your time. You can get more information from the back of a seed packet 
 First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business. 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 I've enjoyed several Ludlum novels, but this one is very slow and it seems to be going almost no where. I'm half way through and don't see much point in going on except to make the most of money I spent for the CD version. It certainly isn't an action-packed thriller I was hoping for. I'd give it 5 stars for non-action and lots of meaningless "yadda, yadda, yadda" if such a category existed

 Certain Victory, The Offical US Account of the the first gulf war, is a long treatise on the support and command and control efforts that went into the war, sprinkled with details of the combat operations. The book, written by Brigadier General Robert H. Scales and his staff is a poorly written, but well intentioned, attempt to convey the meaning of the work and planning that went into the war. Robert H. Scales planning and staff details are interesting, if not informative, however given the immense amount of history crammed into the first few chapters, this book does have some value to those interested in one mans perspective on the evolution of the modern army. If Robert Scales other books are anything like this one I would only recommend them to someone who is not looking for a good read but mearly searching for a book on a military reading list to tire through, this book could have been written in about a hundred and fifty pages, it is filled with drab and unexciting language. For anyone looking for an unbiased and factual history of the first Persian Gulf War I would recommend they skip this staff propaganda and instead read Rick Atkinson's Crusade, The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War . By contrast it is a thoughtful and accurate account written by a distinguished author, unbiased by the reaction of others to his work. Not only is this book more accurate and insightful, it is also fun to read 
 Buy the other, the All The Pretty Horses alone, with reader Muller (sp?) Frank. Brad Pitt does a very poor job, and I was amazed how poor. He hardly seems like a trained actor. He badly mispronounces Spanish (pronounces 'jefe' as 'jeffy')and his reading is like something a grade-school child would produce. He carries the question tone over to the 'he said' in interrogative sentences and does not change voice tone from one speaker to another. He sounds like a slacker who has been forced to read a high-school composition. This guy is an actor?    And the abridgement ruins the stories in all three novels.  Now I have to go back and buy the other because I love ATPH very much and want to hear it read by someone who has had voice training and a good voice 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene.  I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store.  Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days.  Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now.  It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco.  It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this. 
 I found little to no new information on tennis in this book.  Granted, I am a tennis fanatic, but I was hoping for some new tidbit or anecdote, neither of which I got 
 At best, this is an oversimplified rehash of Betty Edwards', "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain." As a much better alternative to both of these books, look into Brenda Hoddinott's, "Drawing for Dummies." Brenda's method is very methodical and step-by-step, not to mention fun and a little silly,(just like Brenda!) whereas this particular book calls for a "If you only look at what your drawing, it will be easy!" attitude. Nothing truly worth doing is easy. Check out Ms. Hoddinott's Drawspace.com website as well. You won't be sorry you did 
 Great use for five minutes then one broke. Having use Kendo Shinai bamboo swords before I would not suggest these and only bought them as I had a $25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of 
 This movie was very much like American Beauty, except it was a little better. This kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern American life. But for all other people, including myself, Fight Club was not that good. And I GET the movie. I am a consumer, like most Americans. But not to a degree where I can relate to Jack who is the main character. Starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one's identity is an absurd idea. What is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of Fight Club. No wonder the only people that joins the Fight Club in the movie are white males. No wonder that the only real people in my life that I saw raving about this movie so far has been all "white men". The movie does speak one truth. Modern American life  has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans. Like I said, I have not come to that point yet and I do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful. People should build a family, serve their community, and make real friends to live a happy and significant life. Fight Club is not necessary unless you really became like Jack. Do not watch this movie unless you are white male. Watch if you are really curious, but it will be a waste of time 
 The book does give Hamiltons WSJ columns, which are of historical interest, but does not provide a useful method of applying the theory.  Much better material on the Dow Theory are available on the internet 
 My unit failed after one day of use (never even got to the field.) Plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue LED would come on but could no longer connect. Bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless. The on-CD manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this.  I liked the standard mini-USB cable connection for the charger (similar feature on my RAZR) but I found it vexing that you couldn't use that same cable for data (it appears to be a standard cable) but instead have to buy a "special" cable for using the data port. They give you the mobile AND AC charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd. Other units using Bluetooth and USB (such as the 4-in-1 by Wintec) provide this. I found a LOT of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing. Folks with working units seem to love them. If you get one with the bad solder connections, you are disappointed 
 This should be the real title.  How many people does George have to screw over before the world wakes up and realizes that this guy is just one big rat 
 These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.  With a longer inseam, these would be awesome 
 I don't really know what was worse about this book, the ridiculous plot or the ethnic stereotypes.  Skip it and watch some grass grow instead, if you're that bored 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 It is necessary to correct the current trend of public commentary, which tends, systematically, not to understand events in the former Yugoslavia but to construct a propagandistic version of Balkan rivalries, designed to validate the existing post-modern myths and prejudices. This book faithfully reflects the post-modern blinkers that its author has helped first create and then perpetuate in his "coverage" of the Wars of Yugoslav Succession. This book reflects his (and their) belief that the Orthodox nations of Southeast Europe - embodied in "the Serbs" - are The Other vis-a-vis "The West" in the Huntingtonian sense. The author's assumptions are prejudiced in a coarse, primordial manner.   Judah's mindset helps us understand why the problem of the Balkans under UN/EU/NATO/UNMIK/KFOR/SFOR. . . is inseparable from the quandary of America under the bipartisan regime inside the Beltway, or that of Europe "united" under the Leviathan of Brussels. This book unintentionally poses many questions, and answers none. Can any meaningful unity of nations sharing European heritage be restored? To what extent, how, and why has the modern, secular, "post-Christian" West inherited the antipathy of West to the carriers of the Byzantine tradition? How do those two traditions converge, and how do they diverge, amidst the continuing onslaught of globalized secularism? Such issues are not merely political. They are as much "cultural" as theological, and they have been political all along. It is on the way we deal with them today that the future of our civilization will depend, and it that endeavor Judah has decided to side with the bad guys.  A book is badly needed to counter Judah's prejudice and ignorance about an area of the Old Continent which need never be the "powder keg of Europe." Though the Balkans, however delineated, contain many states and even more nations, they have one thing in common: for most of history they have not been masters of their own fate, but objects of policy by dominant outside powers. Though depicted by Judah as aggressing against their neighbors and generating wider conflicts, the Serbs in most cases had these conflicts foisted upon them by powerful outsiders and their local minions.  In particular Judah's attempt to relativize the Ustasha genocide of some 500-700,000 Serbs is scandalous. Had the same apparatus of quasi-historical whitewash been applied to the victims of Treblinka, such book surely would not have seen the light of day - and rightly so.  Even if all history-as a philosopher argued-is in some measure contemporary history, it need not be dominated by the obsessions of the day. The cause of tolerance in a troubled region can never be advanced by misrepresentation or by the sentimental lapse of seriousness which judges one patriotism as admirable and condemns another as inadmissible. This book is found wanting on all fronts 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 I purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it. I already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly. I don't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running. You have to constantly shake it to get it going again. Obviously a manufacturer error. I must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at. My kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute. But, it just didn't work 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 If this is the first book on collecting swords that you get, make sure that you get a second and a third before you even -think- of going shopping.  If this were the only guide that you were to bring with you into the world of sword collecting, there is a good chance you will embarrass yourself in front of even slightly knowledgeable dealers.  Throughout the book, the proofreading is poor; that is, if it was proofread.  Numerous captions are incorrect, and the authors research and conclusions are questionable at best. Conversely, this book does have some excellent photographs (many of which I have never seen elsewhere).  Given the inexpensive price, it is worth purchasing for that reason alone 
 This is an exemplary example of NOT judging a book by it's cover. The back of the book insist this is "a hilarious and chilling.......playground for the rich, ...brilliantly suspenseful.."ad nauseum. First I couldn't keep the characters straight because one of the protagonists was a detective named Lynn Cutter. I thought it was a female, which threw me really off track when MR. Cutter gives private investigator Breda Burrows a long look at her blue eyes and long legs. MR. Cutter is a policeman, but one who is hoping he will get into no more trouble until his pension comes through in a matter of months. Along stumbles (literally) Ms. Breda Burrows, a strong woman, but desperately in need of someone with a badge to help her solve the mystery of a rich woman who believes her husband is philandering by giving sperm to a sperm bank.  My sympathies and sense of humor lie with Mr. Cutter, who is really a very funny character and brings life into this incredibly boring story. As Breda's guide they must wander through the glazed world of Palm Springs, where they will encounter oddities that don't fit, bodies that shouldn't be dead and loads of money. This book is not captivating enough, even with Mr. Cutter as a lively character to warrant one star 
 I've read most of Ludlum's so this one was a bit disappointing.  Too formulaic and downright lazy in parts.  The dialogue was sloppy.  One too many "oh my gods" made me think the characters were more wowed than I was. Aquitane Progression and the Bourne trilogy rules 
 I thought the author was going to give a more global context of what blonde means to societies all over the world but instead she said blondes are wonderful, blondes are the most beautiful and innocent and sexiest of all women, and everyone wants to be like us. Hello!! That is the problem. Women of different ethnicities pretty much give up their culture to live the blonde White-American dream, and there is only one reason- to feel more accepted in our society because the closer you are to white the more society will accept you, and one way to do this is to dye your hair blonde. Instead of telling us what we already know, or better yet what society reinforces to us, that blonde is the ultimate beauty, why not tell us how this fascination has hurt society and women especially from different races. I am guessing it was too easy for her to spew off the gloriousness of blondeness- she being a blonde herself, than to search for something deeper because we all know sometimes the truth is hard to take, especially when you are on the inside looking out 
 I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny.   It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.  Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?  Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 I used this book in an OOA&D class I took several years ago, and it taught me absolutely nothing. The ideas are not organized in any particular order, there are no examples or illustrations of what the author is trying to convey, and there is some absolutely worthless software distributed with the book that is so useless you'll believe you're doing something wrong until you realize it is of such limited usefulness that it is basically an Excel spreadsheet with a poorly designed user interface.   This book was so useless to me that when the class was over, rather than donate it to a library or a friend, or just keep it for further reference, I instead decided to throw it in the garbage. This was because:  (a) I wouldn't want to burden the library or another human being with such a useless book. (b) If I kept it, it would be taking up valuable space on my bookshelf. Instead, allow me to recommend "Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design" just recently published by O'Reilly and Associates. One reason I delayed writing this review was that I wanted to have something to guide people toward - such as the O'Reilly book - versus just ranting about how bad this book is.   P.S - On further review, I must apologize to the makers of Excel. Their spreadsheets are much more useful and versatile than the software included in this book. 
 What does it say about "classical" new music that scores are becoming  more and more fearful of silence and ambiguity, its listeners insecure enough in their personal tastes that they desperately want to be solicited as fellow interactants (or co-creators) in the musical experience?   We do seem to move further and further from Glenn Gould's idea of music as "not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline... but the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity" and closer to the notion of the musical work as communal love-in or group lament. Apparently we hanker more and more for music designed by committee, music as a civic occasion. And to raise our lighters, flames aloft, at the next New York Philharmonic premiere. And maybe, while we're at it, to evade security long enough to get up on stage and snort loudly in approval or disapproval at the principal violist's negotation of her tougher string-crossings.   Jennifer Higdon's music sparkles and is beautifully orchestrated. Audience enthusiasm is testimonial to that. But I also find her music superficial, anonymous, and noncommittal in the way tract homes are. The Concerto for Orchestra begins (just as its fourth movement ends) with heavy strokes on timpani and bells, followed by an athletic string figure. Opening a piece like this -- as a commercial spot for Lots-o'-Drums, as it were -- can no longer be a compositional decision, but is now necessarily a cliche, an empty gesture, a kind of sylistic commercialism. At least I would have thought the more private utterances of Debussy, Webern, Bill Evans, Takemitsu, and Brian Eno have made that point.  If we do live in increasing fear of silence, that might explain why the works on this CD never so much as pause in their forceful forward trajectory of pleasure and sentiment. In "river sings a song to trees" (second movement of "City Scape"), Higdon does begin with sparse and mystical glimmers of water-gong, cymbals, flexatone, and glocken; and goes on to parse the music into lush and homey, pseudo-Coplandesque phrases. But elsewhere, and in the entire Concerto for Orchestra, the music moves unrelievedly and stultifyingly forward with all the rhythmic and metric subtlety of a typewriter, never so much as pausing to inhale. But maybe I'm being unfair: if headphoned young people are on the search for software that will vanquish silence and securely curtain themselves off from a dangerous and fickle world, then why shouldn't they have some new "classical" music for that purpose?  In terms of Higdon's material per se, I can only protest again a work that offers no distinctions whatsoever as regards melody, harmony, or rhythm. And a piece where any initial attractions pall on repetition. Agile, clever, and adept with idiomatic effects, the string writing in the second movement reminded me of Britten -- the Prelude and Fugue for Strings, maybe. But Britten's quirky, slightly banal ideas linger obsessively in the memory while I spent more than an hour with Higdon trying to remember things, hoping for an inspired tidbit, some kind of memorable idea. In the Concerto for Orchestra, she helps by putting her themes in quotes, citing and reciting modal and fanfare-like ideas in steady rhythm and unison-and-octave strings. What interest there is comes from her scales and neo-Hindemithian harmonic syntax, which can come close to eloquence in some quieter passages.  There can be no doubt over Spano and his Atlantans. This is musicianship and playing of much greater command and profile than we hear from many other ensembles: rhythms snap, crescendos lift off, and everyone obviously believes in Higdon's music. Especially toward the middle of "river sings," Telarc beautifully frames the warm Atlanta strings in a way that does much credit to engineer and players.  But to what purpose? 
 Boring!!!!!!!!! Anyone can tell by reading the Black Cauldron that Lloyd Alexander either copied from J.R Tolkien or thinks almost exactly like him. I doubt the latter. The Lord of the RIngs were written almost 20 years before The Black Cauldron which tells you something. There is a charactor much like Gollum, whose name is Gurgi, who talks in third person, like Gollum.  There is a dwarf-like creature named Doli, that just so happens to like fighting, is grumpy, and dislikes riding on horses. Hmmmmm... sounds like Gimli. Then there's that Fflam something or an other. Friends with Doli, has long blond hair, and is a warrier also, but also loves music etc. Sounds a little like Legolas. Except for Legolas wasn't a goofball. There is a Big Black Gate....... Sounds like the gate to Mordor. But no.... it's the gate to the land of death. How absolutely unoriginal. I disliked this book immensely. If you want to read real fantasy read the Lord of the Rings or the Inheritance trilogy. Not this junk. 
 In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.  Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:  Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.  Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.  Once said "continent" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.  Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?  Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.  The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.  Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!  I could have made a better movie with my camera phone. 
 This book is composed of two stories.  The first, called Folded Hands is nothing short of brilliant.  Jack Williamson created a rather bizarre, almost tongue and cheek idea, that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time.  Williamson didn't take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the novella.  The second story, for me anyway, felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down.  The Humanoids idea -- that mankind must be protected from itself ,can't help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story, Williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward.  Granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don't play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids.  That in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight! When Asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously.  On top of that, I found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the Humanoids.  They really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences.  I wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue.  Oh well 
 This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.  Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break! 
 Did not like this book.The CD instructions were bad, not clear. I give this book a 2 star ratin 
 This book is most useful if one wishes to study Walter Kaufmann.  This book is a waste of time if you wish to study the writers Kaufmann presents to us.  Kaufmann warps the texts to suit his own agenda.  If you share his agenda you will likely not even notice that he has an agenda.  "If you make people think they are thinking they will love you, but if you really make them think they will kill you. " - Albert Einstein  
 I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind.  So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost.  It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late.  Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works.  The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice. 
 Your Steam Fast will rest EXACTLY 2 ft 3 inches from the ground. This stand cannot change height so it is meant to be used while sitting.  I don't iron that many shirts/clothes at one time so sitting is not necessary, and standing at 5 foot 8 inches and trying to use the steam fast at 2 ft 3 inches can be challenging.  After I steam, i have to get up multiple times to hang the shirts. I don't know why they don't design a stand the raises the steamer to standing height.  Crazy!  Just know what you're getting and you won't be disappointed.   
 After reviewing Amazon's policy for writing reviews, I am not surprised to see that my initial review was yanked due to 'foul language'.  Imagine that...I list in quotation marks several of the author's "lovely" names for vaginas, and my review is yanked.  So get a clue about the gutter language used throughout this book.  There is nothing 'sexy' in this book.  This book should not even have the word "Witch" in its title.  This book is more about alternative sexual practices than anything to do with the Craft.  We are talking alternative with a capital "A".  Write love songs and love poetry to your vagina, dye your pubes, taste your vaginal secretions, play with your menstrual blood and do it all using the most foul names that you can think of to call your vagina.  This is just a few of the 'lovely' rituals and exercises listed in this book.  And can anyone explain to me how dressing up as a man right down to 'packing' (as it is called by the author);which consists of fake male parts attached to your under-wear, will assist me in my quest for body acceptance and female sexuality?  Please....  This book has set the Craft, feminism, and body acceptance back somewhere in the middle ages.  I shudder to think that anyone would ever believe that this book is any kind of representation of witches.  Thanks FireFox...Pagan elders have spent decades trying to put the dampers on the stereotyping of witches as sexual deviants, only to have you publish your twisted take on female sexuality, and put it out to the public as part of the Craft 
 Often hailed as genius, Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood proved far from that lofty title for me. First I read the play. Next I saw a University of Richmond production and finally, I read the play again. I thought I was missing out, somehow, and decided to discuss the play with one of my former theatre professors. At last, I've concluded that although some may find beauty in the so called poetry of Thomas' language, I find nothing but confusion - both for the reader and the audience member. I am a theatre professional and I would not choose to mount a production of Under Milk Wood at any cost. I fear I'd lose the audience 
 I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.   The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.   It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.   I know that "technology as magic" and "religion = magic" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.   Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.   IOW, religion is subject to criticism ("it's not measurable") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.   If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.   The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.  Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this "religious cover for nuclear technology" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it. 
 new york city used to be cool, yeah.  if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!!  then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse.  i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf.  oh well 
 Currey obviously fawns on Giap. Currey has shown no criticil analysis at all in either  confirming or refutting Giap's claims.  He simply passes them on. At times one cannot tell whether one is reading Currey or Giap 
 I loved this phone, but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone can't pick up.  I want it fixed but don't know how 
 I say this because Jackie doesn't usually do wired Kung-Fu and this movie utilized that. It also utilized the sped up frame rate to make the fighters appear more skilled. Now that being said, the martial artists really are quite skilled. They really are pretty quick. They really can do most of those moves. It had some OK though special effects assisted fights, but this movie wasn't really about that. Jackie Chan was trying to break into "real" acting in this movie. I wouldn't buy it if you are trying to watch him fight, and if you buy it for the story....well that's your choice I guess 
 First off, I loved the movie after seeing it at the Anime Expo in California.  This review is not about the story, I agree with the other reviewers, but about the DVD format.  The movie is "letterboxed", not "animorphic/enhanced" so it won't display properly on a widescreen TV/Monitor.  On a regular TV it looks fine but on a widescreen display you get a centerd image with the black bars on the top and bottom, rather than it "filling* the screen.  This is just lazyness on the part of Viz since it would have cost them the same to have it produced either way.  4* for the movie, 2* for the dvd production quality : 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least.  I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk.  Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost  as much as this glamour life stuff pack did.  This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy 
 We bought 2 of these and neither one keeps the wipes moist or warm. Save your mone 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 Other reviewers note Stewart's courage and his recent service in Iraq. Certainly, he chose a difficult and challenging journey. Nonetheless, I found this to be an often unsatisfying read. Stewart offers us scholarly history and a glimpse at a land rarely seen even by Afghans. Unfortunately, he's a big whiner, approached his journey with an enormous sense of entitlement, and displays a lack of cultural insight or sensitivity. He makes ludicrous claims about the benficience of the British Empire and often comes across as a Calvinistic scold. These negative traits are most apparent in the first third and last fifth of the book. Stewart has made other journeys, on foot, in difficult geography and seemed to expect Himalyan hospitality in war torn, tribal Afghanistan. Once he stops complaining and focuses on his surroundings, the journey is fascinating. Unfortuately, the overly entitled foreign service officer reappears as the story ends.   Unlike other grouchy travelers, like Paul Theroux, Stewart seems devoid of humor and an ability to see himself in context. I'm not sure I want to read his Iraqi chronicle after seeing where he claims that his administrative innovations in southern Iraq should be implemented countrywide (in places far more heterogenous and strife-torn). It seems like it would just be more of the same 
 "The service from this vendor is horrible. My account was charged in May of this year and as of 6/26/06 have not received anything. First they said they need to make a model change. I was fine with the model change but never got the product. I sent many...notes to Nicholas Nasti but he has been unable to fix the problem. Recently I have been unable to contact them with notes or telephone. 
 This DVD did not serve the purpose it was intended for. It fails as an instructional tool no matter what level you are on. If you are a beginner, you will be really dissapointed as this video does not address some of the basic rules of dancing, it is not very detail, and it does not guide you step by step. For those who have some kind of dancing knowledge, you will also find it dissapointing because the moves taught on the video are really basic and not very attractive. 
 The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience  during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers 
 This book is a complicated mixture of truth and deceptions, which appears to be designed to hide a crucial problem from the public by placing only a portion of it in plain view. I am a clinical psychologist. The truth in the material Dr. Ross presents is shocking and appalling: that our intelligence and military are systematically creating unwitting mind-controlled slaves using horrifying techniques to deliberately split personalities through the use of hideous trauma and other sophisticated tortures. Many of these techniques are shown in TV and movies, presented as fiction so we discount the possibility of their reality. This report also explains why treatments for mental illnesses which work are being systematically ignored in the mental health professions, a fact which has puzzled me for years. Other parts of the book mislead. For example, all the perpetrators named are conveniently dead: some mere months or weeks before publication. Another example: Dr. Ross states that satanic ritual abuse is not real. Staff of units specializing in Multiple Personality Disorder have told me that when the staff begins to take reports of satanic abuse from patients seriously, funding for the programs has been cut off. It is certainly true that most such units have been closed down, and those which survive are staffed by people who can maintain a studied "therapeutic neutrality". Of course, this lack of support for the validity of the patient's experiences is further traumatizing rather than healing. I will leave it to the reader to draw conclusions about this situation. I regret I consider it unwise to sign my name and full credentials 
 This rating dont even deserve 1 star this book sucks!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your money on this crap 
 Personally, I found this book too advanced. I love Nozick's The Examined Life - Philosophical Meditations. Each chapter of the Meditations is an adventure, but Explanations was over my head,  More academic people than I would no doubt like it.  Nozick was a genius.   Richard Waller Albany GA 
 i couldn't wait to get this. but then when I started reading it, i just got so fustrated with it. i mean, it was such crap...what they were saying. they got everything completely wrong. at the end of the book, i was so pissed off, that i started to just write down why hate their stupid little debates they propose. this book is a disgrace to the wachowski brothers and just the matrix phenomenon in general.   
 High hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release, and I have to admit I am sadly dissapointed.  The transfer is only a 'fraction' above watching a SD DVD version upscaled, which is a real shame.   Buy at your own risk, or wait for a much better release, hopefully Director's Cut, remastered and all.  2.5/5 for effort.  -zallap 
 Two problems.  First problem.  Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer.  For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City.  What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away?  One in ten million?  Twenty million?   Second problem.  The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void.  In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward 
 Attempts to read book (3) Review written in style of B. Jones, as book was also.  Tried to read (not v.g.) book, but first had trouble getting beyond "Bridget" style (not v.g.) Read the four "rave" (v.g.) reviews here on Amazon.  Tried twice more to read again.  Humph.  Still, something bothering about (not v.g.) book.  Seemed little more than simply dissection of Helen Fielding's (v.) successful (hurrah) book.   Finally (hurrah) realized problem: to read (not v.g.) book is to read author's dissertation, which am now convinced "book" is, as (humph) so clearly follows standard "How To Write Your Dissertation" guide-- Preparing the Proposal, Conducting the Research, Writing the Research Paper, Sharing the Research Outcomes with Others...all the way to whole qualitative preliminary study combined with quantitative main study for combined methodology.   Obviously, how-to "formulate important and relevant research question" was something along lines of "popularity of chick-lit from Bridget Jones to present day, and how effects 20-something women seeking poise and confidence" as related to spirituality or some such nonsense. Humph.   End result? Author finished up with her PhD by converting dissertation paper into book highlighting research, as PhD candidates do. (Not. v.g.)    At least not another paper on "Women in 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Bridget Jones's Diary.'"  Might impress 20-somethings, but in  opinion, not a v.g dissertation... er...book.   (the added v.g. and hurrahs and whatnot are as tiresome in book as are in review-humph! 
 Watching the Razor release (which I bought to save a few dollars) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated. Let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times.   Fortunately I was able to find the much-praised version released by ERA of Taiwan from a seller here on Amazon, and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog-sheer perfection. 
 When I borrowed a copy of this from the university library (thank God I didn't buy it), I was misled since it was the hardbound edition without the jacket, so all I saw was "Heavenly Intrigue."  If I had seen the complete title, I wouldn't have bothered.  The authors are truly of this generation, the CSI/forensic-wannabes (every cable channel has them now, very dismaying) who portray the facts from a mystery caper point of view, instead of looking at all the possible factors surrounding Brahe's death.  Having read the other reviews, I find it just as compelling that it could have been Mrs. Brahe who had to euthanize him.  And Brahe, although popular, had his own share of enemies, from religious extremists to possible other rivals.  Maybe even kindergarten enemies, who knows? -- he did have a disfigured nose, a testament to his pugnacious nature.  That should have been an obvious clue to the authors.  As much as they try to give Kepler his due, they also paint him as a villain, on account of his mental troubles, his moods, etc.  Well, I have news for the authors... most scientists have had their psychotic episodes:  Newton suffered from depression (and by some accounts, a form of dementia) in his later years; Leibniz was worse off.  Boltzmann wound up committing suicide.  But the point of all this?  Everyone, especially in those times, weren't quite right in the head.  Hey, if you were living in war-ridden, plague-infested times, would you really be morally sound and civilized, the way we like to think of ourselves now??  I don't think so!!!!!  And what is the whole point of this forensic crap??  Just to prove Brahe was murdered?  To find a culprit, at any costs??  To make Kepler the Fall Guy???    The same has been said about some who have made important contributions in culture, science, and history, like Caravaggio or George Washington (both suspected and/or accused of murder in their lifetimes).  The man lived miserably, and may not have been a saint.  Despite Kepler's being obsessive a scientist (or philosopher, depending on your point of view) as he was... which scientist isn't?... he never quite expected to see the same kind of glory as Brahe did.  Scientists then didn't enjoy the same prestige that we do now.  In closing, I will say that this book completely annoyed me, because it sought to reduce two of the most important scientific figures down to a scientific rivalry that went astray and resulted into yet another murder story.  As storied and tumultuous their relationship was, there is no denying that both Brahe and Kepler's contributions helped usher in the modern era of science.  Without them, Newton would not have had his Laws of Motion, Einstein would never have even thought of Relativity, and quantum mechanics may have never existed.  Brahe and Kepler's story is so much more than that.  Perhaps these so-called science writers (as well as those other investigative writers) should stop speculating -- like what the Da Vinci Code crowd likes to do -- and start thinking, really thinking about stuff that really matters, like the nature of everyday things and the universe.  Life is not an endless cycle of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel but really a testament to the first seven days of Creation, and beyond, and how it works.  And that is what scientists are primarily concerned about -- not about who's right or wrong.  Ultimately, both Brahe and Kepler would have agreed as much 
 I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time.  I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but "Homegrown" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4.   Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent "Who You Fighting For." Now that one is worth the $$$ 
 This is the worst economics book i have ever come across in my 4 years as a student.  The book is not only colorless and boring, but it does not seem to ge the main points across.  Worse yet, the homework questions sometimes draw on information not explained in the text.  Examples are very few, and the confusion is much.  I would advise economic teachers to look elsewhere for a text 
 This book had nothing to do with the title. It was only a brain dump of the author along with his personal feelings and political views. It does nothing in the teaching of the religion. It is sad to think that someone would waste paper to put out something such as this, just so they can say they have a book in print. This gives a very bad light to the Wiccan religion and any other Pagan type religion. It makes others of this religion look as though they are of low intelligence and proves the author has little knowledge of the religion 
 Why this woman starts yoga sitting on her legs is beyond me. I did Yoga in my younger years and did it at the Integral Yoga Institute and went away from the practice for 20 years. If this woman's DVD is the new market of Yoga, it is a shame. This is her version, it stinks and is almost impossible fora 50 year old out of shape body to do, much less lose weight by. Especially by starting sitting on your legs. How absurd, what a waste of money 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 Did this woman really receieve a degree in communication? Well, I'm not sure what sort of communication it was, but as a fiction writer, she needs help. There are more blatant amateurish errors here than in any book I have ever seen published, anywhere.   Just a few examples:  Page 113: "she... wraps a cloth around my head, obscuring my sight. Limon raises a wan eyebrow."  (This is a viewpoint violation which would be recognized as such by any beginning writer of fiction; in a first-person story, you can't describe something you can't have seen.)  Page 9: "retorted my father, who walked in with the doctor." Page 10: (same scene, 6 paragraphs later) "Hello, John Briggs, said the doctor, shaking my father's hand." This sentence contains two errors. First, why would the doctor need to greet the man he walked in the door with? It's also highly unlikely that he would address him by both his first and last name; if he knows him well, he might call him by his first name, and if not, he'd call him Mr. Briggs.  Page 26: "At June's ranch in Mississippi, after... the house was sold to new owners, I ..." Page 27, 8 paragraphs later, next scene: "I considered returning to my aunt's Mississippi ranch to look more closely through the piles of June's papers..." (These sentences contain both a redundancy -- Why would you say a house was sold "to new owners"? When it's sold, they are always new owners -- and a logic error: You can't generally go back to a place you have sold and look through the effects of the person who used to own it, because when you sell a house, you generally don't leave personal crap there, do you?  Page 6 and page 48: both contain a definition of "jinetera" -- a redundancy -- but the definitions do not quite match. page six says it means "a jockey" and page 48 says "a female jockey."  and these are only the ones that have jumped out at me so far; I am only up to page 118. if it was my job to look for them, I'd bet my last orgasm that I'd find dozens more. I would probably want to avoid Harper Collins if I was an author.  I think you could make the case that the editors at Harper Collins really are the ones to blame, and of course, they are ultimately; if this was edited, it was not by anyone who was awake. But those who call this "well written" are pretty deluded; the writer made these errors and while some of the inconsistencies were probably created in changing the storyline during rewrites, it's still pretty lousy writing, and it creates a reasonable doubt as to the intelligence of the author --- and hence the reliability of the observations in the story 
 Mxpx were solidly putting out great albums. They were in between an underground and mainstream band for a little while. I mean they're on a major label but their songs dont get played that much on the radio and they don't sell millions of albums. They probably sell almost as much as Nofx, pennywise, no use for a name bands like that. This album is better than the new piece of crap they put out a year ago but man not by much, this is actually going away from their punk roots and into more just straight up rock n roll like foo fighters. there are some good songs on here but there are alot of songs that sound the same and are startinig to sound kinda whiny. Mxpx is on a hunt to sell out so buy as many of their records as possible so they can start putting out better albums even though i don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 Having to read this book as part of a club for discussion is the only reason I would even spend my time for reading this piece of rubbish. The author is obviously putting his own political leftist views into his view of the  war. The author simply spews out outrageous claims with no factual data to back it up. I, being a centrist and not left/right leaning, found this book to be a biased attempt by a leftwing author to denegrate the accomplishments of the US in their attempts to solve problems in this complex world. Based on the authors views the US is responsible for the world's problems. Total BS coming from a guy who probably benefits from the global policies of the country he denounces so readily. The most amazing part of the book is that if he really believes the crap he writes he should get the heck out of here and move to an eastern block or middle eastern country 
 As Rothman, ruefully notes in her book there have been studies of medicine from the perspective of the doctor and from the perspective of the disease but not from the perspective of the patient.   Thus, Dr. Rothman sets out to do "a history of patienthood" and how being a patient changed over the course of time with respect to one single disease, TB or Consumption.  The problem is that her original sources are diaries, mainly of women but not exclusively. That by and of itself limits her subjects overwhelmingly to upper crust and educated NE families by and large. Overwhelmingly these are the well-off, relatively speaking. Theretofore, all of Rothman's democratic impulses are naturally very limited. The whole thrust of thesis is thus quite silly. This is not a history truly of patienthood, but of patienthood of the wealthy - of a small well-to-do segment of society.   What was it truly like to a patient with TB among the indigent and the poor? Rothman cannot really say for these people kept no diaries and if they did they were certainly not preserved a hundred and fifty years later in some library archives waiting for her to come find them.  Rothman gives us only the narrowest slice of what it means to be a patient.  Furthermore, this is a telling of history through anecdote. So she takes one, two, maybe 3 dozen diaries and summarizes what the people say in them. Who cares! To say these 3 dozen people are a representative sample (even among the upper crust educated elite of society) is downright silly.   It would be like someone reading 3 dozen blogs today on the net and saying they have a general sense of what society was thinking of the Iraq war. Who actually spends their time writing a blog? What is the motivation of those who write the blog? By definition, they are the people with extreme views, angry, disenchanted, frustrated, opinionated jerks. Represenative of nothing.   And this all leaves out the fact that we still have no clue as to biased selection of diaries that Rothman chose, potentially only using the one's that made her point (or only quoting passages from the diaries that support her thesis).  This is not history. This is not fact-telling. This is historical fiction writing.  If you want to understand disease read the work of Robert Fogel, Nobel Prize winning cliometrician. If you want to read historical fiction, go read Barbara Tuchman or Leon Uris.   This is just bad fiction with labored dense writing posing as history. 
 I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.  Other than that, I adore my Brietta doll. She has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way, so I cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls.  Her face has a gorgeous expression, which looks so friendly to me. Her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves, and she has pink shoes that ACTUALLY STAY ON!  I'm just sad that she broke, but I still love her nonetheless 
 This was my introduction to Terry Pratchett's writing.  Reading all of the reviews led me to believe that this book was a funny take on the world of cats.  This book, which reads like an essay of observations, is not ground breaking and is certainly not hilarious.  If I were counting I would say that there might have been ten chuckles all together.  Certainly not as funny as it was cracked up to be. The treatment felt superficial and the observations felt recycled from other writings about cats.  Nothing here would recommend this book over any other cat book or story that I have read 
 Virtually no information is provided on how to restructure an organization.  Most of the book is devoted to human resources activities and how to deal with employees 
 Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...  Don't waste your money   
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
 I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls. 
 You know, usually I am a big fan of older movies as they were typically made better and had better writing, etc. One strong exception that I just watched was "King Solomon's Mines" from 1950. What a doggy movie! It makes even the lamest Disney movie watchable. Basically, it is "Hey, look at that animal!" and then a cut to some stock footage, except in one case where a giant rubber spider creature creeped along like a relative of "The Tingler". Star Stewart Granger also seemed to understand every African language dialect except when it was really important. And, there was also an emphasis on how much ammunition was left, so the final bullets were used on certain natives to great effect. Once they got to the mine itself, it was still snoresville and basically a letdown. This was made before in 1937 and again in 1985 and in 2004 which seemingly the same results according to other reviews. Why do they keep making this same stupid movie??? 
 It's difficult to take anything Mr. Roberst writes seriously as he is on all sides of almost every issure depending on his audience.  He likes to be "confrontational" which, for him, amounts to attacking politicians and groups from the left for doing one thing and those on the right for doing what he told the left they should do.  I guess he believes that makes him "balanced" but it's a lie, he's simply someone who likes to stir the pot regardless whether he actually believes or doesn't believe in the postion he's taking.  And that's the trouble, he really doesn't have any beliefs.  Good reading if you like sociopathic writers 
 This book won't help you at all.  I don't even want to give it a star.  I would recommend The lilaguide: Baby Gear Guide and Baby Bargains 
 Too much fluff. Typeface is very small and hard to read. Pictures have a yellowish cast and the room scenes look dated 
  I find it fascinating how often members of both sides of the evolution-creation argument accuse each other of some kind of questionable practice - whilst doing exactly the same thing themselves.  The credibility of this book can be gauged right from the start of the first chapter - by the arguments presented by an evolutionist who is pulling exactly the kind of stunts that evolutionists most hate (and quite reasonably so) when such actions are being carried out by creationists.  First the author uses a passage from the work of Henry Morris as though it faithfully represented the views of ALL those who prefer a creationist explanation of the origins of mankind.  Secondly the author fails to distinguish between "fundamentalist", "creationist" and "literalist", drawing the assumption, for example, that all fundamentalists are literalists as far as interpreting the contents of the Bible is concerned. This is categorically NOT true - as illustrated all the way back in 1925 when William Jennings Bryan (a renowned fundamentalist but NOT a literalist) explained, in the course of the trial of John Scopes, that he believed in the literal truth of the Bible, but ONLY insofar as it was meant to be taken literally.  Next the author makes an unjustified leap - from saying that evolutionism (from a creationist viewpoint) "may be because of the Devil" (page 1) to the extremist claim that "scientific creationism" is seen by its adherents as "a battle between Good and Evil" and that "either you are for God, or on the side of the Devil" (page 2).  So, in the space of just about one full page of text, the author selected to "open the batting" has indulged in the three cardinal sins so often ascribed to creationists:   - Quote mining  - Misuse of technical terms  - Building straw men as a basis for repudiating the case made by the people you are criticising.  Please note, I am not for one moment denying that "some" creationists may be in complete agreement with Dr. Morris' views; "some" creationists definitely do indulge in quote mining; "some" creationists do misuse (deliberately or through ignorance) technical terms and definitions relating to evolution; and "some" creationists definitely do base their arguments on "straw men" because they are so much easier to demolish than confronting the "facts".  But NOT all of them. Contrary to the implication made by this author, and throughout most of the book, creationists are a diverse lot and definitely not a neatly self-contained, homogenous group which can be written off with a few supercilious side swipes. Nor is it true that ONLY "scientific creationists" (or any other religion-oriented groups/individuals) have criticisms of the supposedly "scientific" evidence used to support evolutionist claims.  (See, for example, "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", by Richard Milton, a science journalist and evolutionist with NO religious affiliations.)  In a nutshell, "Scientists Confronting Creationism" is preaching strictly to the "converted" whilst adding little or nothing to a genuinely informed and useful debate.  
 I've bought and read all of Dan's No B.S. books and was very dissapointed with this one. While he does promote his books and services in the other books, it's not in a blatant hard sell fashion as in this book. So much so, the whole book seems to be a tease and a marketing attempt for his inner cicle's services.   Nonetheless, I'd give Dan the benefit of the doubt, he is after all a marketing guru. In fact, I got a lot of good ideas from his free newsletter. It seems to me, however, that ever since he partnered with Bill Glazer, everything that's published under his name is a non-stop commercial for the Kennedy inner cirlce.  
 This is not bushwick's best work. this cd is not a one star cd the cd should get 3 star's. there are a few song's that are good 
 My husband was so excited, when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up.  He is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right, only to have issues with  the wind barameter.  We have tried to trouble shoot with the online and  handwritten manuals.    Unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box.. sooooo needless to say the  excitement is gone..   
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.    
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 What is with the echo??? It is terrible. However, the music is great. It really upsets me. I saw them open for Pearl Jam and I thought the echo in the mic was a bad sound system, but when I listened to the album I realized he did this on purpose. Why? It could have been great 
 I've enjoyed most of Margaret Atwood's books but I must say that this book was awful.  Very one-dimensional and frankly, boring.  The ending was poorly written as well.  I actually threw this book in the wastebasket after I finished it so that no one else would have to endure it 
 The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. "Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far." Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane 
 I am disappointed in this book.  The patterns are very old styles. However, it has some useful bacis pattern making information.  If you are a beginner, it is helpful.  
 If you are interested to see what other companies are doing, who have no relevance to yours, this book is for you.  If you are looking for practical guidance that you can use in your own situation, buy something else 
 I bought this book without really reading the description. my fault...but it isn't what I expected at all. I was thinking it would be like other mtv books, with lots of juicy info and glossy pages with pictures. It was all black and white expect for a few pages in the middle.  It's almost like reading a teen book of stories...at times it's hard to believe these kids grew up to be such richy rich backstabbing teens. I love the show as a guity pleasure, but shouldn't have bought the book 
 Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing.  One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much. 
 Just got the pressure cooker, and it looks like a great, heavy duty pot.  Very nice.  Because of the other reviews, my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning.  However, after reading the manual, I learned that this CAN NOT be used at altitudes above 3,000 feet -- which leaves out a lot of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah......  Otherwise, I'm sure it's great 
 If you want to read real estate stories just pick up the weekend newspaper and read the Q&A articles in the real estate section. This book doesn't seem to offer any more useful info than those. At least you can read the sports section in the paper if the real estate stories suck. :-)  I'd suggest The New No-Nonsense Landlord from Richard H. Jorgensen. Some of his ideas are over the top, but overall there's a lot of good ideas that you can adapt to your situation 
     As a research scientist, arguments like this, always distinctly American, make me sad. Only America and a few other countries are holding back their scientists with bans on cloning and stem cell research. So far, the best argument to the contrary is the flawed, platitudinous "slippery-slope" concept presented in this book. The idea that genetic research will inevitably lead to a race of super-people is trite at best. In my opinion its sophomoric and idiotic. I have heard the same point presented in a 2002 documentary by MSNBC, this concept is far from original or compelling. In 2003, scientists developed a brain-machine interface for primates. Has this technology led to, or will it ever lead to, a race of cyborg people that are so vastly superior that us normal-people will never be able to keep up? I don't think so. In reality all this technology will ever do is lead to the development of better artificial limbs for amputees. In the same fashion, all genetic research will ever lead to is a greater understanding genetic diseases.   	Proclaiming current research as "good enough" will lead to America being hamstrung in the global race to develop technologies, a race we are already loosing due to globalization and the fact students receive a far better science education in India and Japan. This fear of scientific discovery is a concept better suited for the middle ages. If the author takes even one college level genetic course, I am sure his opinion will change. Please dismiss this book and move on. 
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 A 350-page book of which the last 238 pages are appendices, a glossary, and an index.  125 pages of the appendices are nothing but a listing of NASDAQ stocks, symbols, and sectors. Buy IBD instead for $1.00.  Including the first 112 pages, you will find much info, but very, very  little substance and discussion. It's but a compendium of data. Don't buy  this book, if you are seeking knowledge about how to trade

 I should start by saying that I when I bought this book I thought it was related to the Center for Tactical Magic, but unfortunately it's  not.  Whereas the Center for Tactical Magic does some interesting projects that relate magical systems and occult ideas to a wide variety of issues and disciplines, this book, at best, pays lip service to the notion of applying magical principles in a creative, practical, and tactical manner.  It is far from tactical.  Not very practical.  And mostly it just seems to riff off of other occult practitioners whose experience in such matters made them far less self-delusional. This author should really re-read some of the authors he references - Crowley in particular - and realize that being tactical and doing magick involves much more than "practicing spellblasts", "energy shields", or any other number of Dungeons and Dragons type activities he suggests.  For the most part, this book is a poor collage of other people's good ideas, and the author comes across as inexperienced and naive.  The best part of the book is the first paragraph of "What is Tactical Magic?" where he describes resourceful and contemporary twists for age-old magical practices.  If the rest of the book tried to be as creative and innovative this would be a good read.  But already by the next paragraph the author seems to have become mired in his own illusions.  From there on out it's enthusiastic and well-intentioned but brief and misguided.  My advice to would-be readers is to check out Crowley's "Magick in Theory & Practice", Phil Hine's "Condensed Chaos" or check out the essays and projects on the website for the Center for Tactical Magic. 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 "Sad valor" in someone's eyes? A character who "doesn't know exactly what constitutes begging"? Come on. And those are just two examples of Walker's writing getting in the way of my enjoying the story. The only parts I liked were when they tried to recruit people to vote; that's where the heart of the story was for me, and that was only a few pages' worth 
 This book is nothing more than the usual claptrap from someone trying to make a buck.  if you bought this yellow journalism thinking you were getting beef on the whole "vatican-nazi" connection, mr. williams has played you for a stooge.  even the guy who critiqued this book before me had nothing out of the ordinary to say--just more of the same, 'the vatican is full of pediphiles, the pope himself shoveled people into furnaces for hitler, the college of cardinals is the original COSANOSTRA, yada, yada.'  where are the documents, people?  why did the entire world--no less a global figure than golda meir--mourn the death of pius XII as "a great friend of the friendless jews"?  why did the new york times declare that in the winter of 1942-3 only pius' christmas addresses spoke out as a "lonely voice in the wilderness" on behalf of european jewry?  why did the SS in rome report back to hitler that pius was "obviously speaking on behalf of the jews and...other undesireables" whenever the pope would condemn racism, "purity of blood myths", unchecked military aggression, and so forth? why did vatican city itself gain a reputation as the only safe haven for downed allied pilots strafing german positions in rome?  more recently--why was pope john paul II 'warned' not to go to sicily and roundly condemn the mafia dons that allied generals like patton kept in power at the end of WWII?  if the church and mussolini had anything at all in common, it was their common loathing of the italian--namely the sicilian--mafia.  how could they have been as cosy as mr. williams suggests if mussolini purposely set out to destroy the mafia (i.e., the church, according to the author) as they constituted a blatant rival to his consolidation of power?  please...you're straining your own convoluted logic 
 I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.  I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button 
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 This book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with ASD I have a big question to the author. Where are her children now? Show the evidence they truely recovered 
    Whenever the New Yorker arrives the first thing I do is tear it open, check  the table of contents to see if Adam Gopnik has anything in the issue, and  then, if he does, turn the pages to get to his essay.  Why?  For the very  same reason that I can watch the movie "Showgirls" over and over again, or be riveted to Robert Goulet should I ever find him singing a song on television (admittedly a rare, albeit treasured treat nowadays), or be unable to turn the channel during a Donald Rumsfield press conference. For Gopnik is SUCH a Man You Love to Hate, that it isn't remotely unfair to suggest that he has become the J. R. Ewing of American Letters.  Reading a Gopnik essay--and  this book proves it--is like watching Jerry Lewis singing "You'll Never Walk Alone" at the end of the MDA Telethon.          I treasured each and every word of his "From Paris to the Moon" collection, because each and every word of it was just soooo lousy.  (If you want to read A.G. at his worst, btw, read him writing about New York just after 9/11.  It's a hoot.)  Back to the present, when "Children's Gate" came out, I snatched it up, because I really, really wanted to hate it.  I saw, within five paragraphs,  that I was not to be let down.  As a native New Yorker, I relish when writers  who moved here write as if they were born and bred here and own the place.   Alas, Gopnik writes about New York not like a genuine New Yorker, but like someone  who writes for the New Yorker.  The man...is clueless.  The subject of every Gopnik essay is not whatever the essay seems to be about, but is Gopnik himself; this is a man who loves to write about how much he's read.  Before you put this book in your cart, ask yourself this: Are you really interested in reading the essays of a person who does nothing but read all day?  Can't wait for the next book! 
   Ok..take that back...it does have all the answers in the back of the book, that is worth one star.  I would recommend many supplements to help you learn the steps fully.  Very confusing text, nothing really explained well.  A VERY solid knowledge of calculus is required...get out and study all of Cal 1 and Cal 2 again to refresh 
 it is difficult to learn from. NO examples are found and I often found myself reading a section several times and still not feeling confident that I understood it 
 Today I went and saw the overly hyped 'Saw 3'. You know, the poster with the teeth being hung by a rope?  First of all, on a positive note, I will say that the 'Saw' trilogy is the best horror trilogy around apart from 'Final Destination' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. One thing all of these movies have in common is creativity when it comes to torturing, playing with, and eventually killing their victims. There's no evil curse which infects anyone who enters a certain part of the woods, there's no supernatural crap at all. Unless you could call 'Final Destination' a supernatural force, but it's actually meant to be fate that causes their death, not a being. I saw the first 'Saw' a while ago now. It was quite an enjoyable watch. Two men trapped in a bathroom taking part in all of Saw's games. It was much better than the 2nd version which was just too much like the movie 'The Cube', plus the scene where the girl falls into a whole pool full of needles which then draws blood up into all of them, leaving her weaker and weaker was just too nauseating. Same with this 'Saw 3' - I never turn away from the head splattering scenes filled with blood, but bring a needle about to go into someone's skin, and my eyes will close voluntarily. Strange huh? 'Saw 3' was just more of the same. The same sort of head contraptions but less of the suspense and build up. A man with a chain around his foot that he has to get out of, wait, haven't we seen this before? Sure, there are some new methods of death including being frozen inside a freezer etc, but the deaths are timed to minutes and they either live or die and then the scene just goes to the next person waiting for their fate. The only people who are allowed to have more time than just one minute is a man and a woman (won't tell you who they are though, it'll be a surprise for those who watch) who have little personality, and are shown to be moral and decent human beings because of a couple of things they do within the film: one being the man saving another man from certain death even though technically because of the man's actions in the past, he could have let him suffer and die, and the girl trying to keep Saw alive (because if she doesn't she will die herself). This movie tries to be some sort of 'learning about life' psychological thriller but just seems to come off as a bit lame. And the crazy sidekicks who spray off rants of shouting and unneeded swearing always seem like they're just 'acting' (which they are) but you're supposed to follow them as if you're right there, they seem like scared bunny rabbits sometimes... 'Saw' being shown as what he really is, a psychopathic brutal killer would be enough without all of his head games and ridiculous 'insights' into life. Then again, this is what makes the series original I guess... And of course the 'let's reveal all our secrets' technique for these mindwarping? thrillers where they wrap everything up and let everyone know how each other the characters got to the point they were at. For fans of blood and guts, you should seriously buy a ticket to this, there's plenty.  Fans of substance and a real point should look elsewhere. In fact, parts are quite boring even though the film never stops trying to take the audience into a place they would fear more than death. Watching the main woman character who has the head device on, and thinking how much she looks like Theresa Fitzgerald from the soap opera 'Passions' doesn't help either. Watch with caution. You'll either love or hate this movie. For horror fans, you'll just be kind of like 'meh' 
 Anybody who would recommend this as a history book is completely unaware of the true history.  Brecht may have been using dramatic license or he may have had an axe to grind with the Catholic Church.  Either way, this is NOT an accurate historical account.  Any person who would suggest it as such is guilty of what Brecht and revisionists accuse the Church of doing: suppressing the truth to further their personal agenda 
 "Red Water," a made for television film starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Kristy Swanson, carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off "Jaws." You would think that nearly thirty years after Steven Spielberg's project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre. You would be wrong. Every year brings us even more "animal gone wild" flicks, everything from sharks, octopi, whales, snakes, bears, rats, ants, birds, cats, dogs, dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans. If the creature in question has sharp teeth, claws, wings, talons, tentacles, and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget, straight to video knockoff of "Jaws." Sure, there are elaborations to the standard plot lines, none of which significantly improves these rip-offs, but all of them owe a big debt to Steven Spielberg's film. For example, "Red Water" tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a Louisiana River. It also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed. None of these ideas disguises what is really going on.  "Red Water" is the story of John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips), a down on his luck fisherman with an ex-wife, horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician, and loans on his boat he can't afford to repay. At the same time Sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments, a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers, fishermen, and anyone else who manages to get in the way. Sanders could care less about the shark, primarily because he doesn't know about it at first and also because his ex-wife Kelli (Kristy Swanson) just walked back into his life. She's a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river, and she knows that John is an expert on this sort of thing. Whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name "Kelli" is another matter. Sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles. After all, he'll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat. What none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks, one that swims and several that walk around on two legs.  The movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some Jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities. This guy hires some mercenary thug, along with a goon named Ice (Coolio), to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash. And wouldn't you know it? The site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where Sanders and Kelli eventually show up! What follows is incredibly predictable: the criminals take over Sanders's vessel because they think these guys angling for the money, a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers, and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals. How predictable is "Red Water"? Not only is there a Cajun chap helping out on Sanders's boat, we get a few scenes of a Cajun party complete with music and dancing. Just in case you aren't aware that you should laugh at these hicks, the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to "Deliverance." How clever and original is that? I'm starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows. If you put any minority group in the place of these Cajuns and did the same thing, the outcry would be deafening.  It's not the overt prejudice of the Cajun scenes that sinks "Red Water"; it's everything else. The venerable Lou Diamond Phillips hasn't made a good film since...well...I can't recall, actually. I quit following his career after "The First Power." As for Kristy Swanson, I was surprised to see her here. I remember her star rising in the early to mid 1990s, but at some point she fell off the radar and, if "Red Water" is any indication, into B-movie purgatory. It's sad, really, because she's not that bad of an actress. Coolio, on the other hand, goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money. If I had known from the start that this guy was in the film, I wouldn't have watched it. Aside from the performances, or the lack thereof, the production values are low, the pace drags, and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters' mouths. I really, really wish I had written down some of the odd lines uttered by Phillips's character. I remember watching the movie and thinking at the time, "I should write that down and use it later in a review." For some reason, I didn't. Probably because I just wanted this thing to end quickly.  In another bizarre turn, the movie carries a 'R' rating even though there isn't much bloody carnage going on. The only extras on the disc, fortunately, are trailers for "Bats," "The Big Hit," and "Ride or Die." If you're really interested in watching creatures attack flicks, there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from, most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level. "Red Water" is too bland, too confused plot wise, and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining. If you decide to head up this river, good luck to you.       
 This book will tell you nothing about "history". It reads more like a novel and uses a series of literary devices which do violence to the material it deals with. Human history is not a story - why should it be, it doesn't have an "author". Real rubbish 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I would have to disagree with the pronouncements the book has to make.  I feel very strongly that the Bible does say much about homosexuality, in the concept of sin.  Thus I myself take a literalistic point of view of the Bible.  I believe the Bible is exactly as it says it is, the word of God, the message of God, to a fallen race--us.  The author, on the other hand,  takes a postmodern, very liberal view toward what the Bible speaks of and what the Bible preaches.  By maintaining a postmodern ideology toward the Bible, the author...as many other post modernists...have stripped away the Bible for what it truly means as God's message to the world.  In this case, the author has stripped away the truth toward homosexuality as viewed of by the Bible.  What do I mean?  Let me explain.    The Bible speaks of sin--those deeds that first manifest upon the soul, then formulates in the mind/body, and then done physically.  Within our souls is a cancer, a cancer that is born from our sinfulness in a sinful world.  It is because of this seed of sin that Christ came into the world through virgin mother as the prophets foretold, died on the cross as the prophets foretold, and rose again on the third day as the prophets foretold.  Sin is then "thought of" in the mind and body.  It is the whisper to do evil in our brains, the easier choice in comparison to the right choice, the lust, the desire, to want that burns in our minds and our hearts.  Then, when it is done, it is done through physical manifestation.  In this case, homosexual acts and actions.  Thus homosexuality is an act born of spiritual sinfulness and acted upon out of physical sinfulness.  However, and this is an important realization that is to be known from the Bible, homosexuality is just one of many sins that tempt and bring us to fall.  This, again, is a difference of opinion between myself and the author of this book.  I do not think that homosexuality is any worse than say gambling, or any better than say abortion.  All sins bring forth a wall between us and God, all sins must be forgiven by the blood of Christ so that we will be cleansed.  For you see, all sins are the same before the eyes of God, because they mare our souls and flesh, however, each sins has their own consequence.  And this is an important understanding toward the homosexual issue.  Homosexuality is just one of many sins and all sins are the same before the eyes of a Holy God, but its consequences are different than say adultery or stealing.  But know well that you and I are sinners too.  Our sinfulness might be different than the homosexuals, but we are still sinners that need the grace of God.  Our sinfulness, too, will have different consequences than the homosexuals, but still we are called to love the sinner (just as God loves us) but hate the sin.  This means that homosexuals should not be treated badly.  This means that homosexuals should be given our friendship.  This means that homosexuals can be loved through the love of friendship and through the love that neighbors are to have as the Bible speaks of.  What do I mean?  Well we are all sinners, and we all need Christ's grace.  If you are a homosexual, why should I judge you because of that homosexuality (as long as deeds such as pedophilea aren't done or other illegal actions).  I have known many a gay in my life and time, but I do not judge them, just as I do not judge those women I know who have had abortions.  Yes I strongly take a Biblical POV, and they know this, but I do not and will not treat any less because that would be a wicked deed.  You can agree to disagree about an action done, in this case homosexuality, without having malice or hatred toward the one who is washed in that sin.  You can give friendship to the homosexual while still maintaining a Biblical belief...the only thing that is called to you is that if he or she wishes to know your belief, you act with fearlessness in speaking the Gospel, the truth.  
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 This product is a great idea, unfortunately the design is just really poor. Installation went pretty smooth, the problem is that the thing is really unstable. It flexes, bends and wobbles - basically it's just not supported very well. To add insult, the cover that came with it doesn't fit. I'd strongly recommend you look for one of those mini table top irons if you want something to do touch ups 
   Now here's a publishing phenomenon. Stephens publishes his first book on the Maya and it is hailed by Edgar Allen Poe, among others, as "perhaps the most interesting book of travel ever published". His second book on the Maya, the one for sale on this page, was called "better than its brother" by William Hickling Prescott. 153 years slip by, and a new edition of "Incidents of Travel in Yucatan" is published by none other than Smithsonian Books.  I made the mistake of assuming the new edition, coming from Smithsonian Books, would be of high quality. How wrong I was.  Mr. Ackerman, in his own words, has reduced the text of this classic "by two thirds, but aims to preserve the spirit and essence of the original work". That's right, this "editor" cuts out 67% of one of the greatest works of literature in history, and has the impudence and effrontery to say he aims to preserve the book's spirit and essence. Then, taking the concept of hubris to a new level, he puts his name on the cover under that of the author--as though he had actually added something.  He has added nothing, only subtracted. Besides the 67% of the text, he also removed the name of Frederick Catherwood, who did the marvelous drawings, from the cover.  In the introduction, there is not the slightest hint of shame for the gut job, which he describes: "I have eliminated Stephens' description of the journeys to and from the region...I have tightened Stephens' prose, eliminated the detailed measurements of buildings and mounds, and excised long historical digressions and anecdotes...I have not used ellipses to indicate compression..."  With all the eliminations and excisions and hackings, Ackerman elects to leave in place misspellings because they "reveal Stephens' character and time". Let me get this straight. Historical digressions and anecdotes, admired by the likes of Poe and Prescott, must be cut. But misspellings must be preserved to reveal character and time? What sort of a wacky caricature of a scholar did the Smithsonian Scholarly Book Fund give a grant to?  I have tried to fathom why a person with an interest in archaeology and history and literature would maim a book in this fashion, but I'm at a loss. One would expect this sort of thing if Spielberg were making a biopic about Stephens. Then, the cuts would be necessary to fit the story into a 90-minute slot while keeping enough space for a sassy love interest and a talking jaguar. But this is a fantastic book that eight generations of readers from around the world have loved in its entirety.  Where is the Dover edition?     
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 The book is interesting and has viable principles -- but they're principles found in many other books over the years.  It would have been a good resource about 15 years ago.  Needs fresh approach 
 This was my first book by Pickover, and it will be my last.  His chapters can be entertaining, but ultimately they lead nowhere, and cast no light into the dark corners of the universe.  For a scientist and self-proclaimed skeptic, he seems a bit enamoured with new age mysticism.  In one chapter, he talked about writing down and trying to achieve 100 goals in life.  If one of his goals was to write a pointless, self-promoting book, he can check that goal off his list 
 This book was very dry, and not really what I was looking for, so maybe that is why I didn't like it very much.  I wanted a book on adult learning, but this didn't have much too it for the price.  Read a few pages of the book before you decide to buy 
 I was extremely disappointed by the size of this item.  It is for an individual serving.  I would not purchase this item again, never.  Also felt the color was off, not a true red, more like a coral 
 What type of God would enjoy people using lethal firearms to kill his animal creation. Ted Nugent is the polar opposite of Mahatma Gandhi, a truly Godl'y man 
 The dimensions of this bookbag where not stated.  The bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts. I had to pay double shipping sending it back. A big disappointment 
 I adore the world of the stone people and usualy buy anything and everything on the subject when I come across it. That was the case here, I bought without really looking and learned a lesson. I just do not understand this book. It really does seem like the author just wanted to put a book out about stones and compacted a bunch of information together between a cover. I am sad to say that this book should not be included in your collection. What a shame that trees have been killed to publish this 
 ...the bullet before compromising Michael Caine into this. But, what else could you expect from trash made for TV (sorry for the redundancy) 
 Do yourself a favor: instead of this book buy Manuel Seco's 'Diccionario abreviado del espanol actual'. His definitions are modern and very precise. This dictionary along with the Le Petit Robert are the 2 best modern examples of modner lexography i'm aquanted with. Another choice for those with less knowedge of spanish is a ditcionary named 'Lema', which is published by vox. Although the target audiance is stated as "native adults" this dictionary has the most elucidating definitions of any spanish dictionary i've ever seen. Only caveat is that "Lema" is only available through one online retailer here in US to my knoweledge and may have to be ordered directley from a spanish library. Believe me, I'm not rich and can't afford to buy a 40$ book and then decide I don't like it so I did ample research before purchase, and have used all 3 mentioned @ my school's library. 
 I am getting rid of this book. I followed the recipes exactly but got very poor results. The eclair batter was too thin--the eclairs were flat and impossible to fill. The pastry cream recipe should be called "pastry sauce"--also thin, never set up. The almond paste pound cake recipe fell. The white cake recipe had a very nice texture but shrinks a great deal as it cools. Overall I was very disappointed with this book. It gave me the worst results of any cookbook I have tried in recent memory 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 Let's clear the air right now. No one ever claimed these books were great works of fiction. They are supposed to fun escapism. Sadly the series has gone downhill to the point where I am now nitpicking everything instead of just going along for the ride.  I agree with other comments that suggest this book needed much more editing. Maybe that would have done it. It needed to be read by a totally disinterested third party completely unfamiliar with the subject. Then some of the glaring inconsistencies would have been resolved.  Examples: How does one fly a helicopter into the eye of a hurricane? At one point it is mentioned the hurricane extends upwards in excess of 50,000 feet. Ain't no chopper I ever heard of goes that high. Yet it appears, drops off the passengers and equipment and sails off without a care in the world.  Or another- Summer photographs what appears to be a lady's comb while in the underground cavern. A big deal is made that all artifacts must be returned to where they were found. OK, no problem. Later on, during a meeting, she wonders what the computer analysis of the comb revealed. Uh, wait a sec here. I don't remember the materials actually being turned in for analysis. And sure enough, later on the next page the photos are shown for the first time.  I think some of the wording could be improved as well. We get the point- Summer is one smokin' hot babe. However, some of the word choices in places could lead me to believe Summer & Dirk Jr. are going to end up rolling in the hay together.  And I promise I will not go into the issue of Mr. Cussler's proclamation years ago where he stated all his books would use the metric system and this book does not. After all, this review should just be limited to the subject at hand.  In my opinion, this book needed one more re-write and it would have ranked right up there with the other great Pitt stories. Instead, the next time I'm in an airport bookstore, I'll skip over the Cussler offerings altogether. Too bad. 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 I was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago.  I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her.  BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence?  I mean' C'mon!  Where's volume 2 or 3?  Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it?  If you're a Celine fan, get this cd to fill out your collection, but if you're not...don't waste your money.  If you want a Celine album, I would recommend All the Way: Decade of Hits, and One Heart 
 Reads like an 880-page Disney press release.  Who cares?  Obviously, in a transparent effort to get the toothpaste back into the tube, the Disney Co. hopes to erase a decade or so worth of damaging publicity by hand-picking a stenographer to re-establish the Disney myth.  The agenda is clear, and the result is an amatuerish, bloated, over-written and overwrought cover job.  Not serious journalism and not worth your time 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 it is time for the black race to grow up and stop blaming its problems on whites. as a young white man, i am appaled at this open flaunting of racism. adolf hitler tried to blame germany's problems on the jews, saying they controled the wealth and forced the white man to do the work. this author will tell you that the white man controls all the wealth and forces the black man to do all the work. i wonder who his inspiration was? whites,blacks,jews,asians, and people of the world: tell this racist all he is doing is causing more hate 
 the kid who worte ''hello thats not how school is.''is true.my school has to where unforms.here is the rules at my school...we can't kiss anyone,we can't hug anyone,we can't gossip,.you may think thats boring but thats how school is 
 I was looking for something practical to help me design and build a tree house for my 5 year old. This is a great book if you want to consider "possibilities". It helped a little, as well in terms of providing conceptual designs. It was not as good in providing detailed plans on how to build a specific tree house. If you are an experienced builder you could probably take what they have here and develop your own blueprints. If you are a novice,and need detailed plans this book will not get you there 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 The book is full of pie in the sky mentality and ideals as seen through rose colored glasses. 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 Probably need a couple more listens, but my first few tries put me to sleep. I really like this genre of music, but somehow could not take to this album 
 I was very excited about receiving this book, but then was disappointed to discover it was Christian-oriented.  From the description I was led to believe it was metaphysical in nature, so I'm returning the book.  I was hoping it would be a great addition to my collection of metaphysical healing references. This would probably be a great book for someone of the Christian faith, but it will not work for me 
 While there are some interesting sweaters in this book, her concept of SIZE is so far off, that the book was of no use to me.  She is calling a size small, 14 1/2 inches around a dog.  This is big on my full grown dachshund, would never work for a chihuahua or other dog considered a small dog.  Also the length for a small dog is 12 inches according to her, my smaller sized dogs are around 8 or 9 inches long.  The shaping of the basic sweaters would never work for a male dog, and it goes all the way back to the haunches.  The other patterns in the book are equally "off" for small or even medium small dogs. 
 The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night 
 The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours 
 I was very disappionted by the clear ommision of dog massacering. This is one to miss with little usful information. I am no wiser on methods to dispose of my neighbours dog. I still only know one way and that is quick and painless! I need more HELP 
 I'd just like to add that at a major high tech firm (where I worked) this approach died a slow, expensive and horrible death 
 I think by the time your child will understand this book he will be 6 yrs old and hoepfully potty trained!  Too advanced for a 2 yr old and not enough pictures.  More information than what I needed to know.  I LOVE the What to Expect books for pregnancy and child rearing, but this book didn't meet those expectations 
 As a Russian Student at Moscow Lomonsov State University, my whole education is surrounded by Russia, Russians, and most of all history. I love it. But I don't love this book. I've had it for almost three years and still can't get around to finishing it all. It's a big, big book. One of the reason why I love history books so much is because they are a bargain! However that didn't turn me off, I actually was quite happy with the amount of information and the color excepts were fantastic. I can tell the author is enthusiasm for the cultural history because it goes from speaking about traveling musicians to how Peter the Great abhorred the unwesternized ways of Moscow. I mean, it goes from one thing to an completely different topic in only a paragraph on one page, and then picks up back with describing the local music of the small villages. The information is so rich and he wants to describe everything to us at once that the reader can get so overwhelmed and lost that it becomes boring to read. It isn't my first history book and I have so many unexciting textbooks I have to read, but I rather read my law book -- in Cyrillic -- then attempt to actually finish this book. You would think with around 700 pages he would be able to take his time. No doubt, this is for the serious reader and someone who is in need to cite something for their term paper (the index works very well indeed, that's one star) and the major information it gives you that you could hardly find in a text book (that's another star) but as reading you  
 I absolutely LOVED "Batman Begins" on the big screen, all three times! I was looking forward to reading the book to exeperience the thrill and excitement of Chris Nolan's masterful rebirth of the Dark Knight on the big screen. Apparently O'Neil forgot about Frank Miller's contribution to the Batman legend.  Unfortunately, Dennis O'Neil's novelization of the book kept me from reliving one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've been a huge Batman junkee since I was a kid, and that is the only reason I finished the book.   The book yields nothing of the pain and fury of what is seen on the screen as the transformation of Bruce Wayne into Batman takes places. You don't not get the demonic sense of a man walking the line between vengeance and justice that Nolan created.   Too much fluff, not enough depth, and absolutely no flow. In fact, O'neil leaves out one of the best scenes in the movie when Batman screams at Flass "SWEAR TO ME." That scene alone captures the anger and fury of the character.  A disappointing read. Its too bad Greg Rucka wasn't allowed to write the book. "No Man's Land" proved he knew how to capture the essence of the character, and convey desperation of a dire situation to the reader. 
 If you are a college freshman, this book may be useful. For anyone who is out of school, there are many better books available. One that has some depth is How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist. How do I know? I purchased both at the same time 
 I don't usually bother reviewing things but I had to say something about this. First off the positives: it is hard and demanding. My muscles were sore the next day. That's it. The negatives? Well, let's start with the completely amateurish presentation. She may be fit but she comes across as if she doesn't have a clue what she's talking about. She doesn't do mirror cueing which I think is a basic requirement. In the cardio intervals, she has to take breathers so just as you're ready to go onto the next move you have to stop to let her catch up with you. Some of the moves in the cardio intervals I think are not good for lower backs - lots of bending down, touching the floor and back up again sort of thing. The stretch section at the end is useless. You don't stretch your upper body at all and all the weights sections are for upper body.  And then they finish off with a water fight while some manic bloke shouts 'you did it' over and over again at her.  If you can ignore her and switch off before he jumps out you will get a good workout. But there are plenty of challenging DVDs out there which are much more professional 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 I don't expect therapy from a romance novel. These two characters dislike each other - "she's humorless, and  prim", and "he's shallow and aimless." They talk about "having to like yourself" - ARGH. They definitely NEED therapy. She loves him but doesn't think he loves her (yawn), and is generally disapproving of him and only reluctantly admits he is a kind man. (Whoa, hold me back!) Delusional feminist overtones (I am strong, I don't need a man, but my deepest dream is to have a husband and family...),   This is a big disappoitment: dry, no chemistry, the big secret is so anticlamatic...and so much exposition instead of story - just let us live it with the characters instead of telling us everything! Read at your risk 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 No, I don't own this cd.  I had the extreme misfortune of attending a party for airline employees (Daisy (my date at the time) coerced me) and you guessed it, they were playing this cd.  Unfortunately, they weren't serving drinks quickly enough and I got a good, sober listen to this one.  It's mawkish, boring, and dated.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy this cd and avoid parties where they play this kind of music 
 I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months.  at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject.  rereading it now Im not so sure.  Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them.  What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy.  His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas.  Its plain dumb, like many other "anglo-american" readings of "continental" philosophy.  spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.    To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint.  
 This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, "So What?" Don't waste your money! 
 This isn't really a novel, it's more like a book length collection of semi-comic bits. Despite massive hype it quickly and rightfully went out of print when it came out and it's amazing to me that it was reprinted. The author, his friends and former students have managed to give this tedious read five stars, but believe me you'd be wasting time, money and paper if you picked up a copy. AIDS is a tragic, terrible problem, but silly books like this that use the disease to appropriate some drama and gravity only trivialize the situation 
 I'm new to this type of book but the first I read was Lee Child's "The Hard Way" featuring his loner hero Jack Reacher and after that this book was an incredible let down.  Implausible plotting and idiot characters was my main problem.  This is set in rural Georgia and I didn't buy it.  Seriously- one of the main protaganists has been raped by a jesus freak, her twin sister was killed and she was being abused  by her ex-skinhead boyfriend and she had an abortion.  She's also a police detective.  Yeah- dopey 
 I wish I'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it.  I had the same problem many other reviewers here had: after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks, the cable snapped, rendering it useless.  This is just a poor quality machine, plain and simple 
 The top doesn't seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering. Also, the bottle being so narrow it's hard to clean. 
 Hey! If you can't get interviews with anyone who makes the show, just phone some fans and tape the conversation! There's a little more to this than that but you'll learn nothing from the book that you didn't know and while it eulogises The West Wing it oddly makes you think less of the show. It's just padding filler of no lasting consequence at all. But, hey, apart from that, it's fine 
 There is a rumour and large number of Interviews, he wants to realize his long dream to be the very first blackguy in the main role of James Bond 007. As a Rapper his talent is acceptable, although he does not actually always do a good Rap albums what every youngster believes nowadays.   But as a smart british Agent 007 and his dream as the first blackguy in the James Bond-movies ?? I believe, the late author Ian Flemming will be rising up again from his grave and finds no peace.   
 I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there.  Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting.  I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this one 
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
 This shirt is too tapered in the body and sleeves and feels very confining. The people who like it must be quite thin, indeed.   It does not wrinkle because of the high percentage of polyester but it doesn't breathe very well, either.   I am giving it 2 stars only because of all the color choices, though why someone would want a dress shirt in some of the available colors is beyond me.   For the price, you can do better, even at someplace like Target 
 Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!! 
 I just recently bought this and was very disappointed with the sound quality. Stereo became available in 1958 and was around when the Beach Boys cam out with Little Deuce Coupe. Little Deuce Coupe Album was available in Stereo or Mono. Why would anyone at Capital want to release box set with most of the songs in Mono when they were available in Stereo? Capital needs to fire someone. Now I am stuck with a poor sounding box set. Bad move on Capitals part. : 
 Its a low level polemic against social sciences. The author holds up evolution to explain modern human societys. Something between Wilson and "The bell curve" His knowledge about social sciences is not funded.. 
 I've had this and a DVD ordered since January 2nd.  It was supposed to ship today, but they sent the DVD.  I don't understand what is taking so long.  It's a CALANDER 
 A book on human morfologic evolution and ancient tools (stones). A few words on culture precisely. If you dont want to read about bones, stones, more bones and more  stones read instead "The Prehistory  of the Mind", by Steven Mithen.    
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 This book is about the rise of the House of Rothschild but it is not written for the casual reader of history.  This is written for the scholar whose subject matter is economic history.  As that is not my field of study, I found the book boring in the extreme (it took me two months to wade through it).  However, for the student of Jewish history, it does have some interesting ideas as to the origins of some of the Nazi propaganda 
 Don't waste your time.  10 books that could really be done in two.  Each volume is worse than the previous.  This guy is just trying to fill pages so sell more books, page after page of mindless babble with now value to the story line or even realted to the story line.  I'm actually goi9ng to throw these int he trash since I've finished them (I finish ewvery serties I start.)  I don't want anyone to have to go through having to read this stuff.  The unfortunate thing is that it is a good story line.  IF money grubbing did not get in the way he coul dhave done ti in three or four.  IF you're curious try the first one and take my word the next 9 are just more descriptions of the clothing.  
 Ours also has great picture and sound, but ours also stopped playing any DVD's whatsoever within a few months of purchase.  Unplugging it as the support dudes suggested seemed to make the problem worse.  It would be fine if we were just using it as a TV, but we bought it specifically to watch DVD's on, which isn't so great for us 
 If you aren't a hard-core fan don't buy this CD. Spend your money on their first CD or "Hearts of the Innocent". If you have those two, be content that you have their best 
 One star is too much. I didn't know much about Sylvia Browne before I read this book, but I now know all I want or need to. This book left a distinct bad taste. The first 60 pages were devoted to chronicling the young Sylvia's social life and the succession of beaus that were supposedly in love with her, as well the various outfits she wore and how she styled her hair before going out on a date. Gifted or not, the whole book seemed boastful and conceited. Plus I really question the spirituality of a person that could dismiss her mother's death as "no real loss" and refer to her ex-husband as "evil" and  proceed to slander him at every turn. She constantly wanders off in her anecdotes focusing more on details of crimes rather than psychic ability. This is a vanity book. Save your money and find something else to read. 
 If you are looking for play food that is like little tikes or fisher price, this is not it!! There is a reason you get 101 pieces for 19.99!!  These pieces are much smaller and made from a thinner cheaper plastic.  Not at all what i expected from a quality company like step 2. To top it off, this set does NOT come in a retail box but is cheaply packaged in plastic bags.  I am sure my daughter doesn't mind these are cheaply made or small but i sure as heck do.  I could have bought a Kidconnection set from walmart for less money and maybe even of better quality 
 If this book had ended differently, I would have happily written it off as a really mediocre and not too memorable thriller.  However, I read the ending at a vulnerable time in my life.  I was horrified endlessly by it... to me, it took the book from "mediocre thriller" status to "life is so base, horrible and pointless, why bother?" status.  It was truly depressing.  I am still haunted by the horrible scene at the end, which I really was not expecting...  So, consider yourself warned.    I also think it's hilarious the way they explained the title in the movie... I was wondering how they would do that.  They totally glossed it over!  In the book, "In the cut" is a rather graphic sexual reference (uh.. yeah, you guessed it) and possibly metaphor 
 NPR's Morning Edition caught my attention one morning with a piece of bumper music - a rendition of "New York, New York" played entirely on car horns. It was the sound you would get if you could orchestrate Times Square. It was utterly delightful and even got the normally-reserved hosts giggling. A quick search of the NPR site brought me to the title "Gravikords, Whirlies and Pyrophones." Now who could resist that?  Alas, "New York, New York" is one of only two or three cuts on the album that can be listened to in an unaltered state of mind. The rest is, well... experimental as promised and confirms why experimental music is not mainstream.  On the other hand, having in your collection a version of "New York, New York" played on the car horn organ is worth every penny of the cost 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 This book is filled with information. Too much information in my opinion. If all the info about diet, work hazards and alcohol were true, then there would be hardly any babies born in this country! This book is very alarmist and over-reactive. It is geared toward women who are having a hard time getting pregnant, and basically uses scare tactics rather than provide helpful information about realistic ways to deal with infertility and simple things that can be done to get pregnant.   A prime example of the alarmist content of this book is the list of occupations that supposedly put a man or woman at risk of infertility. Well, people who are stockbrokers, airline pilots and police officers have children all the time! It seems unnecessary to scare readers into believing that their job, or their spouse's job is causing the infertility. I would hate for readers to feel like they needed to change careers just because they read in this book that it is not a good career for fertility! What un-useful information!! 
 Watch out! Be noted that www.EclipsedDistill.com is an empty site. There is no source codes available. You'll get stuck if following its tutorial after Chapter 10. It wastes so much time to make everything work without source codes 
 First question:  why is the talented Madeleine Stowe is this negligible piece of cinematic garbage?  A paycheck's a paycheck I assume. This is another one of those purportedly psychological thrillers that allows screenwriters to throw together some ideas and dare the audience to figure out what's going on. A vampire cult of some kind has taken a young woman under their wings, spiriting her away from her distraught mother.  Teen angst is a thematic element but the teens are so immature, you can only wish they all get zapped.  The movie ultimately makes no sense and serves up one of those ambiguous endings so popular in movies these days.  A real bummer here, folks 
 On avrage, I read fast.  I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages.  Normanly that would take me 2 days.  This boring book took me about a week.  From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand.  I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction.  It had some crude parts, as well 
 The Riftwar was a good saga.  Pug was good.  Tomas was good.  Arutha was good.  Everything was good.  Then Feist came out with this series...  Anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the Atlantis attacks comic books by Marvel, the Eternals by Jack Kirby, and the Fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where Feist stole this storyline from.    A dreaming Mad God that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/A dreaming Black Celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?  C'mon, I can't believe I'm the only who has seen this.  Everyone takes ideals from someone, hence Tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid Pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the Dreaming Celestial(KING KIRBY) and the Eternals.  If he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.  In this book, besides the old guard, Erik is the only guy we really care about.  Characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like Miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  All in all, a very poor effort in the Serpentwar saga.  Feist gets an A for stealing storylines and an F for originality.  I'll stick to newer guys like Simon R Green, Aaron Mccarty, and Ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi. 
 This book is a piece of trash. Do not be fooled into buying it 
 Let me explain the situation.  We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball.  Sound familiar?  Probably not.  I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept.  Recomendation?  I have none.  I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film 
 Being a Greek myself I was incredibly disgusted and offended by some of the claims that were made in this book. The broad generalities were ridiculous. Not all sorority girls get drunk have sex and are anorexic. In fact over 20 of my 50 members do not drink and we're not even allowed to have scavenger hunts because it is nationally considered "hazing".  More offensive than the picture she paints of sorority girls was the fact that she shared so many secrets about ceremonies.   A great deal of the information she acquired are things that we in our sorority have NEVER written down but has been passed down for over a 10o years through traditions and secret ceremonies. I was upset to see some of these things written down in a book that bashed the greek system.  I'm not saying all greeks are perfect but to conclude that most are like the ones in this book is just upsetting 
 The authors set out on what *appeared* to be an interesting project. How could philosophy be reconstructed in order to be made compatible with the "results" of second-generation cognitive science? Yet Philosophy is not fundamentally an empirical enterprise. Empirical results, while interesting, do not often help to answer philosophical questions. Knowing that we conceptualize time as moving does little to tell us whether the A theory or the B theory of time is true. One of them must be, for they are mutually exclusive alternatives. Is space-time kind of substance, or is it merely a system of relations? Are propositions about the future true *now*? Nothing in this book will give you an inkling. The authors seem confused between a thing and and our conceptualization of it, and the majority of this book just seems like a long ad hominem circumstantial. Even if everyone who ever believed in God was absolutely insane, that would do nothing to settle the *philosophical* issue of whether or not God actually exists. The fact that we conceptualize time spatially tells us nothing about whether or not time is really like space. It might be, and it might not be, the fact that we conceptualize it thus is entirely irrelevant to the issue. The problem lies in their calling these cognitive mechanisms "metaphors", since calling them such presupposes that they cannot be literally true. Since the authors treat them as metaphors, they win by default, and there's simply no argument to be had. For example, they call "time is space" a metaphor. But is it really? The past does not seem to be co-located with the future. They do not interpenetrate each other, and this presupposes that they are indeed "separated" some quasi-spatial sense. It would have been better if the authors examine these "metaphors" as they went along to decide whether they were true or false, instead of postulating a priori that all conceptualizations must be nonliteral. For a whopping 600 pages the content is remarkably sparse. Their shallow analysis of philosophical theories is more likely to inspire laughter than serious reconsideration. Their theory of truth is also very deficient. If whatever is true is true "according to an understanding" how is it that anything ever turns out to be false? Suppose I have two patches of color that are almost exactly the same shade of red, but not quite. Let's call them red #96 and red #97. Suppose further that they look indistinguishable. Then I propose to you that the two patches are the same shade. You look at them and (mis)percieve that they are the same shade. So the proposition is true "according to your understanding". But it is in fact false. Truth fundamentally involves a relation between the asserting mind and the fact asserted, and all the cognitive science in the world cannot change that. I give this wasted exercise two stars 
 After trying (and failing) to stay awake whilst reading the novel, I can recommend it as a sure-fire cure for insomnia! Aside from that the book is boring, badly written and a real disapointment 
 Anglophone readers probably don't realise that Latour meant this book as a tongue-in-cheek exercise to capture the postmodern social theory market in his own country by using a postmodern style to show what an illusion  postmodernism has always been. But, as fate would have it, when someone  sneezes in Paris, an Anglophone is felled with pneumonia. It's hard to  believe that anyone with a firm grasp of the history of the last 250 years  of Western culture would find this book anything more than a diversion  worthy of maybe a couple of arguments in the pub. It's telling that  historians of science, who are really the people who are in a position to  hold Latour accountable to anything he says here, have given the book a  chilly reception. Classify this one under 'Pseud's Corner' 
 I would like to say thankyou for the first two seasons - all original episodes! I will not be buying this third season until all the episodes are the original. 
  I was forced to read Abel's Island for a school assingment. It was about this mouse on and island. Very boring.... It was miserable to have to read this, so do not waste your time reading it! 
 I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy 
 I'm sorry this crooner just doesn't cut it for me. This performance was uninspiring to say the least!  Where was the up-tempo excitement this style demands?  Well thank goodness we have a solid group of "Swinging Stylists" to keep this wonderful music ALIVE. Here is a few of the more talented ones....Harry Conick, Michael Buble, Steve Tyrell, Jamie Cullum and the gifted Peter Cincotti. Oh and how can I forget the GREAT Bobby Caldwell!! 
 The movie manages reasonably well to be objective, although it occasionally leans towards being pro-Coulter, but it's not as black-or-white as Coulter's prose. The problem with the movie is that it's only 37 minutes long and still padded with footage of Ann talking to her mom on the phone and things like that, and it doesn't provide much actual information. It does provide proof of one thing we could already guess about Ann Coulter: She loves to be provocative. She says she loves to get hate mail. It seems like she exaggerates her hatred for liberals in order to be provocative because she's addicted to arguing and debating. And not debating with the intent of reaching any conclusions but debating just for the sake of debating.   So, the film was only mildly interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD. Ann Coulter fans may like the extra material consisting of footage of some of Ann's speeches. This footage runs for about three times as long as the film itself. 
 The other reviewers were right! Thank God I only borrowed the book from the public library. Had I bought it I would have demanded a refund.  Is this really Evanovich writing? Or is it mostly Hughes? I find it hard to believe that she can write this bad after reading the Plum series.  Max is ultra rich, established right away in the first chapter who thinks he knows everything there is to know. As for his car Muffin... I'm not so sure what to say about a menopausal car.  Jamie sounds dumb, like a flat character trying to find dimension.  The story, plot, etc. leaves much to be desired. Good thing they put a limit as to how low your rating can get or this would be a negative 
 I bought this book because of some of the good reviews I had read here on Amazon.  However, I am struggling to finish it.  Aside from a few humorous comments, I can not relate to this book at all, being someone who cringes at the terms "dyke" and "queer" and who is a relatively mainstream (i.e. straight- associating) lesbian.  There were some comments in the book that I found ridiculous, like the insinuation that Thelma and Louise were in fact, in love, and that's why Hollywood made them die at the end of the movie.  Come on!  Talk about paranoia.  I realize that there is a lot of prejudism against homosexuals in our society, but I think the authors are a little too sensitive in some areas.  In most others, I simply could not (and did not want to) relate to what was written.  I refuse to purchase or praise music, books or movies just because they are written by or about lesbians.  I also found the regular references to one-night stands and casual sex, while probably true, to be very depressing and embarrassing, since it makes it look like ALL lesbians are that way.  In my opinion, this book doesn't represent professional, mainstream, conservative lesbians with relatively high morals (are there any besides me??) at all, so I could not find much with which to identify.  A waste of money, in my opinion.  But, if you stongly identify with the in-your-face lesbian culture, you'll probably enjoy this book 
 It took me a long time to get past the first few pages of this book.  I kept putting it down and picking it up again because I thought it might improve if I got far enough into it.  Wrong!  The premise of two lawyers, one who was out of work for a few months and now lands a job as a Manhattan ADA, and the other who's hoping to make partner in a high powered firm is dull and predictable.  Sara Tate, the new kid on the block in the DA's office gets a volatile case that will either make or break her career.  Her naivete in dealing with the worst criminal element in New York is laughable.  Her husband, Jared Lynch, spends more time kissing butt trying to make partner than practicing law.  It's self-obsessed Yuppies at their finest.  Overall, this book was disappointing at best.  Weak plot line, terrible ending, and too many neurotic, self-absorbed characters.  Do yourself a favor -- watch a rerun of L.A. Law instead of reading this book.  Actors Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey play similar roles to the characters in this book and you will find that they are much more believable and entertaining 
 This movie is slow, boring, and poorly acted and even worse it was a constant stream of every actor in every scene talking about and smoking CONSTANTLY!! It was so distracting that I could not even finish the movie. I mean I am pretty sure the novel did not have pages and pages of characters smoking- I realize this is a timepiece but come on- who financed this movie? Phillip Morris!!?? 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 I was very interested in this product when I read the description.  However, after recieving the product was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar.  If you have any sense of intergrity ignore this product.  The author must me one of the biggest decievers out there to put such effort in this product 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 The latest work of the Donald appears to be even more ghost written than the earlier three, demonstrated especially by its overuse of trite cliches and simple sentences.      The book is intended to be a means to express  views on America.  Covering almost every current issue from a very  pessimistic and critical viewpoint, Trump's analyses are strongly worded  and many void of the technical analysis that might prove them more  feasible.  Among his most potent claims is that getting even must be among  America's top goals just as it has been for him in his New York-based real  estate empire, demonstrating to this reader that he has no concept of  domestic or world affairs from his current job as the dictator of the Trump  Organization.  He incessently makes analogies to his billion dollar empire,  using it as his main medium of experience off of which to gain creedence  for other ideas.      Trump makes the begining of the book more a temple to  his father's memory than a political platform; by the end, however, he has  explained all of this critical thoughts and poorly butressed ideas and then  turns to attacking other people in the political spectrum.      At the very  least, the suffocating arrogance in this book is entertaining, and hence  probably worth your time if you are interested in Trump; it is not  recommended for the reader looking to gain an understanding of real  politics in the coming race 
 I only caught the 2nd half of this movie on tv last night so can't comment on the movie as a whole except to say that I am no fan of ludicrous caper movies.  But I must point out that the scene near the end where Julia Roberts runs up to George Clooney as he's being led away by the cops is totally stolen from the final scene of "Green Card" (Andie McCowell & Gerard Depardieu) and it's not done nearly as well, either.  Don't want anyone to think that got past me 
 Had this book been the work of a novice Sci-Fi author it would have never seen print.   The story follows the life of one Lazarus Long, a character who is easy to see is only a thinly veiled cover for the author himself.  Lazarus is a character who is so convinced of his own personal superiority that late in his very long life he travels back in time so that he can father himself.  As further example of his self superiority he had himself cloned into twins of the opposite sex.  Twins that he later has sexual relations with.  Even the conscience mind of the artificially intelligent computer that controlled his space craft transferred itself into the engineered body of a woman so that it too could have sexual relations with Lazarus.  To make it further insulting the sexual advances of those characters is not of Lazarus' choosing but rather of their free will.  Indeed Lazarus fends off the sexual advances of his cloned twins until they reach the age of consent.  This reveals how shallow the author feels the drives and motives of others to be.       The story follows the life of Lazarus Long through a series of 'flashbacks' as the character struggles to find a reason to continue his existence.  Most of the flashbacks deal with how the character traveled about the Universe starting colonies on untamed worlds.  Each of these mini-stories is an equally self aggrandizing yarn about how Lazarus fathered virtually every child on the planet while single handedly delivering the worlds he founded from lawlessness, ignorance, and barbarism.  Among these 'gems' are such classic lines as 'there is only one way to comfort a widow' implying that the answer was sex.  Yes, among these stories there are a few meaningful bits of wisdom such as Heinlein's list of what things a man should be able to do.  To save you the grief of reading the book just to get to it I'll quote it for you below. . .        "A Man should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."                 - Robert A. Heinlein    Certainly I can agree with that.  These are abilities that every man should endevour to have to make himself complete.  But they are not the exclusive domain of men. Unfortunately this bit of wisdom is so embedded in mounds of garbage that reveal Heinlein's low esteem for women it is not otherwise worth excavating.  One comes away from this book knowing that the Author felt that women are worth nothing beyond serving as receptacles for a man's sexual needs.  Throughout the book examples are given of how a man should be able to do all of the above while women, conversely, are scarcely credited with the ability to do any of those things.  That this book was ever nominated for an award is a blemish on human history 
 I wish I could rate it lower than a 1.  It's far worse and more blatant than Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Church.  I found it interesting to note that he teaches you how to get rid of dissenters before he teaches you how to listen to legitimate complaints.   After seeing their fellow church members kicked out, how will people with 'legitimate concerns' be willing to come forward?  The church growth apostasy (yes, APOSTASY) is taking over all denominations.  I have seen it in Evangelical Covenant (rampant there) and being pushed on the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (you can see it all over their website in their 'igniting congregations campaign') Mennonites, Baptists, and the list is endless.  The older saints who just want the pure word of God, realizing that adding all the trappings to it is just distracting from the truth, are called 'sanballats' (leaders from hell).  What a respectful way to treat fellow believers who may very well have legitimate concerns.   Take a stand against this apostasy.  It will come to your church 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed. I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be. My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk 
 I had to mark "one star" since the reviewing system wouldn't allow me to give "zero stars".  I was very disappointed to see  that someone supposedly very educated would assume that the "absent  father was the culprit." (see pages 91-92) Did he ever consider that  there are fathers who wants equal time with their child(ren) but are denied  time because their former and soon to be former wives have convinced others  that the fathers are undeserving of such time?  Imagine a wife who creates  a massive amount of debt while her husband works two jobs to pay the bills,  she begins an extramarital relationship with a co-worker, she hides her  commission money from her husband, she leaves her husband with all of the  bills, she files for a divorce, she files for custody in order to limit a  child's time with his father, and she files for child support in order to  get child support money even though he is still paying all of the bills  that she accumulated only because they are considered joint debts and he  doesn't want to damage his credit.  Who is really the "culprit"?   I returned this book to Amazon.com, and I will never read another book by  this author again 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 1. they leak 2. too expensive 3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers 4. doesn't work well for feedin 
 With the phenomenal success of "The Poseidon Adventure", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was sure to be a hit.  Not so.  A plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great.  Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also sound promising.  Unfortunately, the magic of the set production of the original is not even close.  Instead of upside ballrooms, barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes.  The rest of the cast is comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script.  There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief.  Irwin Allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel.  Considering the original, that's a terrible shame 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed.  Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents.  I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter "The myth of intergration" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts.  Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds.  As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information.  
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 While Sigma Six Software development is an interesting book, very little of the book has anything to do with software development. Most of the commentary and examples in the book are about Manufacturing, not about Software development.  While the book does have value, it is mostly a decent overview of Sigma Six in general.  If it is your goal to learn about Sigma Six in general, there are literally hundreds of generalist Sigma Six books in the marketplace. Hopefully, someone, someday will write a good book on Sigma Six that focuses on software.  Unfortunately, the cover and title of this book does not reflect its contents 
 The author clearly believes you should train an infant and not use diapers. But then there isn't a clear plan for training a baby. This is kind of a mix of lots of ideas without a committment to one specific plan. Kind of confusing, not too helpful. 
 This book was very disappointing for me. I've heard of Dr. De Bono and expected much more than what he offers in this book. It's bascially an elementary book about common sense divided into different segments (hats). I would not recommend this book 
 The book perpetuates harmful stereotypes about aging.  Cohen chastises  older people who try to take care of their health.  He claims that they are  searching in vain for a "magic bullet" to regain their youth.   Cohen then advocates a false mind/body dualism.  Through this dualism, one  gives up taking care of their body in order to follow their creativity.  I  honor the author's belief in the importance of creativity; however, I  believe that the approach presented is self-defeating 
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 THis book is so wack.  I should use it for toilet paper.  What a moron.  Survival of the fittest my a$$!  What an ignorant fool for writing such garbage.  Do not buy it 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture. 
 I hate to say this, but "The Who Sell Out" is my least favorite album from The Who (only counting the albums I've heard).  As much fun to listen to as Psychadelic Rock is, I don't feel The Who do Psychadelic Rock quite like The Doors or Jefferson Airplane.  And I realize that the radio inserts are part of the feel for the album, but I find them to be a bit annoying.  I would definitely say a fan of The Who should get this album, but anyone that is new to experiencing The Who should look at "Tommy" or "Who's Next" or "Who Are You".  But I'm sure there are many big fans of The Who that really like this album and are most likely pleased by what they hear 
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 I ordered a human resource book and it took 9 day when you said 3-5 business days. I thought i was getting a hardback book but when i got it..it was paperback with small print and black and white pages. I have sold books via Amazon but this is the first time buying and it was very disappointing 
 Like all guitar players, I was excited when this book came out.  In fact, I bought it hardcover for $30 at a local bookstore.  When I got home, I dove in...more like fell into an overly-comlicated, wordy, and mostly speculated work.  I read through so frustrated that a writer could do all this research and then write THIS!  Dregni writes in detail about the fierce stares in photographs, and makes baseless hypostheses on characters, yet mulls over other details.    Still, this will undoubtedly become the bible for Gypsy Jazz fans because of it's inclusiveness.  Don't be fooled by the hype.  This is a bad book full of great information 
 "Fascism, what it is and how to fight it" is presented as a work by Leon Trotsky, but is in fact an assemblage of excerpts from various of Trotsky's writings, collected and ordered by Sara Lobman and printed by the Pathfinder Press.  The original source for each passage is cited in a footnote.  Other footnotes, apparently written by Ms. Lobman to make Trotsky's references more familiar, give historically useful facts such as "The Jacobins were the revolutionary petty-bourgeois forces in the French Revolution of 1789."  As a short introduction to Trotsky's thought, it can serve its purpose provided one is already versed in Marxist rhetoric 
 Around 100 thread count, worst possible quality, not soft, not comfortable. Pattern is ok, but these people think you'd buy a turd if it had a Jedi on it 
 And simple math answers too. For example, (1/2)(2/3) = ? They say it's 1/6. I'm of the opinion that it's actually 1/3. That's just one of several I've ran across.  Still, it's better than nothing, but I think looking at your old college textbooks and doing the ETS questions is probably a better route 
 At first glance this is a great book. However, once you've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration. The author, illustrator, and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. We all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on TV and at the movies, but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children's books as well? This is a clever book and I was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series. The greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind, however 
 I bought this soap just to see what all the Philosophy hype is all about. I was not impressed. It smells just like ordinary soap-so what? The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. You can get soap that smells better at Wal-Mart! 
 I would like to know where I report this company for stealing my money... DO NOT buy this game. Period 
 I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser,  but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric.  It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad.  The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable.  I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one,  just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose 
 When I buy from the "Back To Mine" series, I expect "smooth" and "groovy".  This one offers not much of either.  The individual songs don't always fit the late night mood, they don't work together as a group, and the transitions between them are jarring and awkward.  I can't recommend this CD.  Don't be duped just because you like Morcheeba, as I was 
 "The Girls Guide to NASCAR" would have been a great book if  segments such as the "girlfriends" tidbits were ommitted; some female race fans are older than 16.  The question that refers to "the possiblity of a driver taking notice" assumes that every female is in the hunt for a man when she is inside the garage area.  I truly hope this is not the case.  I have read another guide of this type which was just as informative without the high-school, teenie bopper focus.  Not every girl is a Kasey Kahne fan just waiting for him to notice........My wife bought this book hoping for an insider's view, which she got.  But it wasn't the kind of inside information she was looking for.       
 I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).  Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.  Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:   COSTS  Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?  First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...)  Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)   ACHIEVEMENT  In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...  In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools.  When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student.    Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.  VESTED INTERESTS  It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.  Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.   Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!  Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.   HYPOCRISY  A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.   Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)  I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)  I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)   What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...   (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)        
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 At first, I was VERY pleased with this printer.  After a few months, I kept getting a "carriage jam" error.  I have no jams, buj to reset the printer takes some cumbersome effort.  I got online, and learned that this is a COMMON and known problem with this printer.  Shop around -- the printer is great, except these "carriage jams" appear out of nowhere and for no reason -- a glitch -- and it takes up to five minutes to reset the printer to work again.  Good printer, until it jams... 
 The book is a solid introduction to Law and Economics at the  "Microeconomic" level.  It surveys the standard topics in Law and  Econ., e.g., Property, Torts and Crime.  There are, however, a few too many  topical sections whose relevance to the text is questionable.  While some  may enjoy random inclusions that do not have much to do with Law and Econ.,  I found them tedious.  For example, sections on the death penalty and gun  control are uninformative and are included, I feel, for completeness' sake.   The textbook is not rigorous, so anyone expecting a complex review of the  subject will be disappointed.  However, it is a good introduction to a  burgeoning field of study 
 I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I am totally disappointed by this feature.  I cant believe that after the excellent quality of Toy Stories and other Pixar movies, they come out with this 4-color cheap feature of Buzz Lightyear.  I really dont understand what happened.  When I got the tape and watched it the first time, I was wondering if it is a bootlegged copy, or was it made in china or what...  I cant believe it, I cant believe also all the high ratings above!!.. 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 In the United States, there is a very rich history of producing field guides to American Domestic Architecture.  So it was into this already crowded field that "The Abrams Guide to American House Styles" was published in 2004.  In my opinion, if you are going to introduce a new book into an established field, you need to do something new.  This Guide has two features that are unique.  First, all of the photos are in color.  This is the first Guide that I have seen that has done this.  I really enjoyed seeing the photos of the earliest American homes.  Second, unlike most field guides, this Guide continues to the current day. I thought that adding examples of McMansions was a very nice touch.  Most other field guides stop somewhere around 1950.  Field Guides can be divided into photo books and line drawing books.  I prefer line drawing books because they help the reader concentrate on the architectural features that combine to make a style.  I think photo books are less effective because they are too specific.  Instead of concentrating on the stylistic details, the photos make the reader concentrate on a specific house.  The other reason I do not like photo books is that photos are inherently distracting.  Instead of concentrating on the architectural features, the eye is drawn to foilage, electrical poles, cars and people walking in front of the building.    The Abrams' Guides does a good job of cutting out most of the distractions but where if fails miserably is in the trees around the house.  A good 10-15% of the images are ruined by trees getting in the way of the photographer.  Either they block the full image or their shadow obscure key details.  I can accept a few trees around a house but to have so many photos ruined is unacceptable.  It as though the editors did not have enough photos and they were forced to accept poor quality photos to fill out the book.  If your tastes run to photos, purchase "A Field Guide to American Houses" by Virginia McAlester.  If you prefer line drawings like I do, check out, "The Visual Dictionary of American Architecture" or Lester Walker's "American Homes".  Looking at old homes and determining their sytles is a great hobby.  The Abram's Guide is a very poor introduction to this rewarding past time 
 Williamson might be a leading figure in his field, but he can't seem to organize ideas to save his life.  It's almost as though he wrote the book in one stream of consciousness, and no one ever went back to check that things flowed, language made sense, etc.  One of the most painful books I've ever read 
 As a gay man, I could not possibly come to Terry Eagleton for help or advice. He is like the university professor who throws his hands up in the air and says: "I can't help you gay people become great critics and theorists; go see Judith Butler or Eve Sedgwick!" Eagleton is a white heterosexual male who has ONLY one thing going from him: class analysis. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have anything. In fact, all he can talk about is class. Look very carefully in Eagleton's texts: gays, women, and minorities do not hold a very high place . . . if they are ever even mentioned at all. I suppose Eagleton would prefer they simply weren't there, clouding up reality. Eagleton must be a very troubled man: not only is he himself a bourgeois academic, Fredric Jameson is superior to him in every way and has said it all (in terms of Marxism), leaving Eagleton with only re-chewed polemics. 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 This book is very informative, but some of the information boxes are missing the wording.  It cuts off some of the words, so the information is incomplete and makes it hard to follow what is going on.  I want to know who to contact in order to get a better edited copy of this book.  I have almost completed reading it, but I would have liked to have received a correctly edited copy of the book that I paid for.  Thank you for listening.  Chereese Jower 
 This toaster worked great for a month. Then the lever stopped working properly and half the time we can't get the slots to stay down at all. I do not recommend this toaster.  The warranty from Cuisinart is useless - we would have to spend our own money to ship it to them and then include $7 for them to ship a replacement or repaired toaster back.  
 Despite the description, this "Stainless Steel" grater is plastic with a stainless barrel. From the description, I thought that the ENTIRE UNIT was stainless. Although the exterior is a heavy-duty plastic,  it is plastic, nonetheless; not too much different than the cheapo version  that I already own 
 NOT WORTH THE MONEY 
 I have read just about every trading, stock scandal, biography type book and this was probably the worst book I've ever read.    As far as Kessler as a writer, he is decent.  The stories were told nicely but the content is what disturbs me.  This was the first book I've read of this type concerning analysts.  I am very familar with analysts and how they work and have done some analyst work myself.  This book justifies to me why analyst are the most worthless people on wall street and how investment banking has ruined the true, real analysts similar to how Kessler described himself in the early years.  Now to the stories.  Lets just say that analyst are no traders and shouldn't even be hanging out with them.  Kessler's "wild" tales sound more like a frat house than a Wall Street war room.  $4000 dinner?  Big deal.  Almost got into a fight?  Whew, that was a close one Andy.  What disturbes me the most is how he never talks numbers.  So and so did this deal and so and so got paid for this.  How much?  Why should I be excited that you donated 6 months of your life and earned 200K airline miles if you're not going to tell me how much you and/or your associates earned?  Most of the deals he participates in he doesn't see a dime from.  What the hell?  So you devote your time and life to kiss butt in anticipation of getting a bone.  The only good thing he did is get out and go to the buy-side of the business.  Kessler spends countless chapters relating stories of traders and other Wall Street bankers that were busted and thrown in jail for this and that, but he tells them in passing as if he read them in the Wall Street Journal instead of getting the inside scoop.    Perhaps the worst story of Kessler's is his supposed encounter with the infamous Nick Leeson of Barings Bank in a Hong Kong bar.  He claims he will never know if it was Nick but it couldn've been.  Great.  So he could've encountered an infamous trader who did way more wild stuff than him but he is not sure it was the right guy.  Let me help you out.  It was not Nick Leeson.  First of all Nick Leeson never traded bonds as you claim the man was a bond trader.  Secondly, the encounter took place in 1990 and even if he had been trading bonds, Leeson was not trading in Asia until the early to mid 90s.  Great story by the way.  Basically this book illegitimizes the analyst business and proves to me how boring and worthless those people are.  I would advise to read this book only if you are interested in falling asleep.  
 I got this book to read out loud to my children.  They seem to enjoy it (after all, Blackwell's story is fascinating and inspiring!), but I have been disappointed.  The characters are rather flat, there is a lot of  repetition, and the author moralizes a great deal.  I have ended up reading  only excerpts from it as I can't stand to slog through the whole thing.   Although the book has been informative on the barriers that Blackwell  overcame and on her accomplishments, I wish there was more social,  historical, and medical context 
 My Great-Aunt Dorothy having recently died, we have all been steathfully setting aside piles of books as we sort out her estate, "oh, I'd like to read that" or - as in the case of this one - "I keep hearing how funny this is".  I snuck The Egg and I off for our weekend at the beach cabin, thinking I was up for a delightful Life Among the Savages (Shirley Jackson) type book.  No.  Not even close.  This woman comes off as being so snobby, racist (the nasty comments against Native Americans will make you cringe), and whiny, I'm stunned that it is the same brilliant author who gave us Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle.  This book isn't a light-hearted treatment of adjusting to rural life on a chicken farm.  It is an unending stream of complaints.  I don't even get the feeling that she likes her husband and, as a tale of the early years of matrimony, hearing her complain that he looks at her shoulders more for the burden they can bear than for the sake of admiring the shoulders themselves, I think she deserved every vomiting puppy she got.   
 Good, as the 'break this rule' bits are well taken, but most writers will eventually come to these conclusions once you really start struggling with paying the bills. 85% of the book is anecdotes you can easily skim or forget about as filler. There are very few useful web sites suggested compared to much weightier works available, such as 'The Freelance Success Book', among others. The writers clearly spent little time working on this, but understood how easy it is to get wannabes excited enough to buy their book 
 I really do find this book helpful but was sadly disappointed to find that it didn't have enough activities for 2 yr olds.. If you are teaching children 3 or older I think you will love it.. I have recommended it to my friend who teachs preschool.. But if you are a toddler teacher I would recommend to search for something that has mostly toddler activities. 
 This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back 
 This is a disapointing book.  The writing is verbose and akward.  The information is poorly organized and too frequently incorrect.  I advise others to buy the Oxford Encyclopedia of Wine, Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, or The World Atlas of Wine, before buying this book 
 Where's the father in this story?  With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad.  If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best.  I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids.  They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly. 
 I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).  In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard. 
 After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here 
 I have this and have used it for about 5 months. I have never had problems with it starting, but it drives me crazy with the dripping all over the counter and the amount of condensation. I am looking for a new sterilizer because of this. I do not recommend. 
 This was a quick read, but it could have been written so much better.  The conversations between Sharde and Jeff were filthy, unrealistic and a bit overdone (full of the f-word, c-word, p-word, etc.). I know this is a work of fiction, but new lovers would not talk to each other this way so early in the sexual relationship, unless someone was getting paid!   Ms. Lee needs to mix it up and be more creative with her word choices to keep the text from being repetitive and annoying. Both Jeff & Clay constantly referred to Sharde as "honey" and Jeff used the phrase "holy hell" at least 10 times.   Sharde had no self-respect and came off as being a needy black chick and was willing to let Jeff do any and everything to her. The sex between them was just nasty. Jeff requested something from Sharde that he couldn't get from his ex-wife and fiancee, who were both white. Interracial romance can be done without feeding into racist sexual stereotypes. 
 I like Alanis Morissette, but her voice is so un appealing with this song?  I could think of several other artist that could sing this song much better than she can.  I swear I wanted to puke when I heard her try to moan this song out.  My dog howled in dis- approval, need I say more 
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 Dr. Conway (John Carradine) runs a strange medical home in a decayed and isolated mansion.  How strange is it?  Well, it's so strange that Lobo (Tor Johnson) works there.  Ed Wood occasionally receives a writing credit for this bit of 1957 drive-in dreck; in truth his only contribution to the film is the character Lobo, which is lifted directly from Wood's 1955 BRIDE OF THE MONSTER.  Even so THE UNEARTHLY, scripted by John Black and Jane Mann, is certainly bad enough to be an Ed Wood movie.  Unfortunately it isn't nearly as funny.  Dr. Conway's newest patient is Grace (Allison Hayes), who is unaware that the place is a front for unnatural experiments involving artificial glands.  Fortunately for Grace, murder-on-the-run Mark (Myron Healey) stumbles onto the grounds and proves more than a match for the good doctor and his evil associates.  Throw in Marilyn Buferd, Arthur Batanides, Sally Todd and an idea or two yanked from H.G. Wells' ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and there you go.  By this point John Carradine had been typed in mad doctor roles and he delivers a typical John Carradine mad doctor performance. Allison Hayes, a beautiful and interesting actress who never got the breaks she deserved, is an always welcome sight--and yes, it is fun to see Tor Johnson doing his slack-jawed routine again.  But in a general sense THE UNEARTLY isn't so much a badly made film as it is an utterly uninteresting one.  If you're among the hardcore fans of 1950s drive in fare you might enjoy it, but I'm not holding my breath on it.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 Maybe my expectations were not set accurately, but I wasn't looking for a touchey feely book that simply repeated the same silly message for 161 plus pages. waste of money and time.. now I am going to have to rush and play catch up with all the work I missed while spending quality time to read this dribble 
 This book started out okay but by the time I was half way through it I was wishing it would end. There were too many characters and the time travelling was just confusing. When I got to the end of Novel I was so thoroughly confused that the only thing I could say about this book was that I wasn't very good. I've read a whole bunch of other books by Diana Wynne JOnes and they were all alot better than this one. So instead of buying this one go look  at the Dalemark Quartet, The chrestomanci series and Archers Goon 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 This product did absolutely nothing for the puffiness around my eyes.   I had much better results with a generic version of Strivectin-D for eyes.  I don't have dark circles (thankfully) so I can't address that aspect 
 Having received a minor in Mathematics in college, I was confident that I could take something of value from this book but I'm afraid that was not the case.  I can't imagine what kind of feeling a person who wasn't as familiar with Math would be left with.  The hypothesis set forth in the book amounts to nothing.  The author doesn't satisfy the needs of the reader.  He leaves them out to dry without finalizing any aspect of his "report."  Neither does he supply the reader with any reasons as to why solving this problem would be useful.  He simply says that there are many reasons, without naming them.  I, personally, cannot think of any good use for the theorem that predicts the frequency of prime numbers.  There may be a good reason though and that's what I wanted from the author.  The last complaint I have is with the superfluous and pointless charts, graphs, tables and diagrams.  They do nothing but confuse the reader more.  The book is well researched.  It paints a nice picture of the history of Mathematics(traced all the way back to the Ancient Greeks) and it clearly defines the progression of the study of prime numbers.  It also provides biographical information on some of the most brilliant mathematicians ever including Gauss and Euler but I don't think that's what the author intended to be the best part of the book.  If you want a historical and biographical account of the study of Mathematics, I'm sure there are better books out there.  This one fails to deliver on the importance and the future of the Riemann Hypothesis 
 Leary is a hack. He wasn't "influenced" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary.   The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape.   On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original.   
 I rented this film immediatley after seeing the first Bride with White Hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story.  There was a perfect setup for a sequel and I couldn't wait to watch it unfold.  After the first half an hour I knew that director Ronnie Yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn't really give a damn about how interesting the story was.  Poor dialogue, inadequate story, there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film.  If you enjoyed the first BWWH you'll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying 
 It is difficult to believe this is the same George Crane that penned "Bones of the Master." I can only believe the Fox has taken his soul along with his ability to tell a compelling story.  If you want to read about sex and drugs, I suggest Hunter S. Thompson or Charles Bukoski. If you want to read about Zen, see Robert Pirsig.  If you want to be bored, buy this book.  Sorry, I loved "Bones of the Master," but this author has lost his muse and seems proud of it 
 I bought this based on the two previous reviews which are dead wrong.  There is nothing orginal about this album.  It is still just manufacturered idol crap.  I will give 'just will' the benifit that he has a strong voice but this album is not worth buying unless you want idol drival 
 This was the first book I ever read by this author.  The book starts out rather amusing and funny, and even though the plot seems silly it starts out pretty well.  For the most part, the book kept my interest, up until the end which was waaaaay to quick and the whole scene with the wedding was just stupid.  Infact, I really liked the book up until the stupid ending.  And Erdle was a disgusting character and I couldn't stand him at all 
 This is not a good film. And I'm surprised by the relatively positive responses here and on critics' websites. I found the story flimsy and obvious, the acting over done or boring, the characters uninteresting, the lighting frequently too dark and overall aggrivating.  I do love Altman, and appreciate his stamp here. The intensity of activity and conversation is here, but limited by glaring accents and dialogue. As great as some of his films are, he has equal the number of films that don't work, and loyal I remain, but this is one of the latter.  
 IF YOU LOVE GOOD MUSIC YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE GREAT ENTERTAINERS!  WONDERFUL SINGERS AND VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CELTIC WOMAN OR OF THE BEST IN CELTIC MUSIC THIS DVD AN CD ARE A MUST TO OWN!!  
 This book includes a few not-very-clear paragraphs about motise and tenon joints. Not clear? for instance, it does not tell you how to hold your rolly willow branches still while you drill. Other than that, it expects that you will hold your furniture together with nails, or sometimes screws. To my way of thinking, this is not really furniture 
 This is the worst Mountaineers book I own. The information inside is completely outdated and useless. It concentrates on gear for 3/4 of the book (outdated gear) and gives little useful information. If you are looking for a book on the history of snowshoes, look no further. If you are looking for useful information try elsewhere. I'm usually too lazy to review most books, but this was just that horrible 
 this book is barely enjoyable and only in spite of the truly awful stylings of mr okrent.  his conversational overuse of simile forced me to put the book down several times -- beyond tedious.  his cutesy language is even more frustrating when coupled unnecessary sesquipedalia.  i'd prefer cogently connected chapters any day.  further, the images he selected do not enhance the story.    most of these complaints have nothing to do with the admittedly complex and large scale of the story.  i am a graduate student in a real estate development program in new york.  anecdotes about rock center have come up in various classes and i was eager to learn more.  while this book does contain salient facts and stories, it is difficult to recommend something so poorly crafted 
 This glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse. Since one still has full function of his/her hands when using this, you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing. When using these gloves, your hands and wrist will feel better at first, but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse 
 I admire Cicero and and I like THE NATURE OF THE GODS, but I give it 2 stars because of the poor translation, which renders a lucid book intolerably boring. So, please throw away the PENGUIN edition and check out the same title by OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSCIS translated by P.G.Walsh. After you have compared the two editions, you will realize the weakness of J.M.Ross' translation 
 My Great-Aunt Dorothy having recently died, we have all been steathfully setting aside piles of books as we sort out her estate, "oh, I'd like to read that" or - as in the case of this one - "I keep hearing how funny this is".  I snuck The Egg and I off for our weekend at the beach cabin, thinking I was up for a delightful Life Among the Savages (Shirley Jackson) type book.  No.  Not even close.  This woman comes off as being so snobby, racist (the nasty comments against Native Americans will make you cringe), and whiny, I'm stunned that it is the same brilliant author who gave us Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle.  This book isn't a light-hearted treatment of adjusting to rural life on a chicken farm.  It is an unending stream of complaints.  I don't even get the feeling that she likes her husband and, as a tale of the early years of matrimony, hearing her complain that he looks at her shoulders more for the burden they can bear than for the sake of admiring the shoulders themselves, I think she deserved every vomiting puppy she got.   
 Cop Land The film starts by showing some off-duty cops. One drives away, and is struck by a speeding car. When he tries to get them to pull over, they point a long barrel object at him. This officer fires some shots at the fleeing car, it crashes, and both occupants are dead. Drugs are found in the car, but no weapon (or so it seems).   Next we see the Freddy, the Sheriff of "Garrison NJ", across the river from New York City, handling small town problems. Many NYC cops chose to live in this small town. Some of them share a secret scandal. There are interpersonal conflicts among them. Internal Affairs is searching around to find that missing cop, who seems to have gone off a bridge. [Can you believe this?] The Sheriff wants to know what is going on in his town. The missing policeman is a liability to his friends who are hiding him; so they try to eliminate this problem. [Can you believe this?]  The policeman who went into hiding escaped from his friends and co-workers, and shows up at Freddy's house; but he needs to run off again! So Freddy goes to visit the IA detective and tell what happened. But his information is rejected! [Can you believe this?] So now the story changes tone and Freddy begins his own investigation. But the rogue cops are aware and warn him off. And so the story plods on to its ending, when the good guys finally win.  There are no "Sherrifs" in any small town in NJ, that is an elective county office. "Police Chief" is the correct title, and they are appointed by the local politicians. I think those wide-brimmed hats are to be found only west of the Delaware. These campaign hats are a relic of the 19th century militia. Bergen County is located across from New York, its many small town could be a site like "Garrison". Really "Fort Lee"? I don't know why Hollywood avoids any such story about a locale on the West Coast. Too close to home? 
 Functional is the Word in my opinion. I did not think the selection of bracelets in this book equals the other 500 items books. The book publishing, the physical part and the photographs are fabulous. The editors selections leave some doubt in my mind as to their abilities in selecting items. I think a bracelet is to be worn as an accessory or an adornment not to be a dangerous object such as a bracelet of lighted birthday candles- A big paper wheel you can stick your arm through  also stretches the boundaries.  I cannot stretch my imagination enough to consider some of the selections in this book as a bracelet 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 Though it is evident that the author has done a lot of research and interviewed many people in DeForest Kelley's life, this book is poorly written.  In many places it reads like a transcript of stream-of-thought interviews, and many things seem only barely relevant - such as pages-long digressions on the careers of friends and relatives.  I'm left with the impression that De Kelley was sort of a shallow person, a personable, mellow guy, drinking and smoking life away between parts.  They're often scraping on the edge of poverty but always have enough cash for "partying."    It was interesting to learn of Kelley's many brushes with big stars during his movie years.  And we do find out about his Army career, some behind the scenes stories of the "Trek" years, and the story behind his pinky ring.  But after reading this book it appears there wasn't a lot to the interior life of De Kelley other than relaxing with his wife, smoking and drinking, and watching the grass grow in his back yard.  The "Dr. McCoy" who inspired generations to enter the medical profession was in reality a heavy smoker who died by inches from cancer in the hospital.    This book really needs some editing to make it more readable.  Perhaps someone else can take the author's extensive source material and depict a much more engaging "Horatio Alger" story of this starving actor's slow rise to worldwide fame 
 My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last year. The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived. It was nearly impossible to assemble. The time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old. The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information.  80% of this book is filler.  I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.    No need for this book 
 Like many others, I was really excited when I found out the excellent 33 1/3 series was doing a book on Loveless.  I have been a fan for years, and still count it high on my list of best albums of all time.  There is some good info in this book, but the author comes across as relatively annoying in his presentation.  The book is badly organized, even ending with a chapter about an unrelated band! In the book McGonigal even mentions that it had to be rewritten because MBV's Kevin Shields disagreed with the first version of it. If you love the album, you will think the book is OK.  Just be ready to ignore the author occasionally 
 The author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book.  The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion 
 I DID NOT order this book and I DID NOT authorize a charge to my credit car 
 In my opinion a better conceptualization Of Mary Wollstonecraft's Life, Ideas, and Experinences is author: Frances Sherwood Tile: Vindication.    However the Gordon book is an adequate read  
 If you are thinking of leaving an abusive spouse, this book may help you. The latter section, "Dealing With," is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of "you know you're a redneck if...". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. "Toxic People" is too broad a category. These are ways to identify Abusers: those who are either (or both) physically and mentally abusive of others. I'm sure it will help some people, but it wasn't what I was looking for at all 
 We all know that Cyndi Lee is a guru in the industry.  So, I was very disappointed that she chose not to use actual photos to depict poses and correct postures, but rather line art 
 When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?  I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.  But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.  Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?  I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.  by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito 
 John Haught's concern, in his book "Deeper than Darwin" to convince us that science and religion cannot only co-exist, but can co-exist without relegating either the former or the latter to second chair.   He tries to explain this by arguing that the two may well simply be interpretations of the world 'on different levels.' To show how 'different levels' of interpretation are possible, he resorts to metaphor. Just like social issues can be explained in terms of psychology, economics, politics, biology, etc. (each interpretation being right on its own level of explanation) he agues that science and religion can also do this.   But this is where Haught's coherence ends. Nowhere does he give much of an explanation as to what the "deeper" level that religion supposedly gets to. Nowehere does he address the question of how, as the Bible (and other holy books) make historical predictions that can be checked by science (many already disproven), the two are not at odds.  What's more, Haught gives no reason to suppose that religion occupying a "deeper" realm than science is anything short of the kind of Gouldian "non-overlapping mysteria" he writes so sternly against! If he means something different, he never made it explicit in the book. We are constantly left guessing what "deeper" might actually mean.   Lastly, Haught seems to resort a decent amount to the "god of the gaps" idea that he, again, rails so much agianst in the Intelligent Design movement. Science hasn't explained x, he exclaims, and might not be able to. Therefore, religion should supplant science here. But that is EXACTLY what ID is.   In brief, this book needs to be rethought. The ideas need to be presented more explicitly (rather than every paragraph seeming to be a rehash of the one that came before). Haught never quite gets to the point and (maybe) because of that, fails to offer anything convincing; his only offer is poetic prose. 
 This book is cerainly a disgrace for BRS in general. Unlike the beautiful Biochemistry and Physiology BRS, this Anatomy book is really a disaster at least reputation wise for the BRS.  Yu don't believe me, just buy it and you will NOT want to study from it.  The most crucial thing in Anatomy is a good diagram, but there are few diagrams and they are horrible anyways 
 Having used this pedometer for several weeks I have found that it does not always record your activity.  Like a previous reviewer, I have noticed from my first usage that it may not record your steps when you are not walking quickly.  But in the past few days I have also found that it does not always record vigorous walking either.  It simply stops recording entirely at times.  I have another pedometer, costing less than half of what this one cost, without all the bells and whistles, but it is accurate and dependable.  This product is not only not worth the price being charged for it, but given its inaccuracy, is not  worth any price 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 I was hoping to find new information here that I did not find off the internet from websites like Nappturality, Motown girl, and other nappy sites. I have been transitioning for 4 months. I have relaxed my hair for most of my life. I must be honest, it makes me think that I could have written this book. It is nothing more than a pamphlet with an advertising plug to the writers' website to buy products. Much too expensive for the "information" provided. I could have given it 1 star but I do not have the heart. 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 this machined worked well. It was quick, until today We tried to use our Rancilio Espresso Machine this morning and it would not heat.  I am reserving judgement as to whether I will be able to get this thing repaired under some kind of warranty.    
 Thought the book was disjointed, difficult to follow and not very interesting.  Instead of this garbled mess, read Wert or Monaghan 
 Tony Robinson has the skill, through his personality, to convince the viewer of the thoroughness of his research and sincerity. Indeed that is what comes over in this documentary.  Unfortunately when the documentary is closely examined it is not objective. For example Robinson conducts an irrelevant Grail chase and he ridicules Dan Brown's claim that all the art, architecture and secret societies in his book are real. However, Robinson does not prove that any of these are false. It is true that he challenges their significance but that is not the same as proving that Brown was wrong in identifying them.  This documentary lacks the balance that is necessary to make it credible and my impression is that it follows a preconceived notion to present the book as a hoax. Unfortunately Robinson appears to have lost the plot for the book is a work of fiction 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 This book was intelligently written -- too intelligently. In fact, I found it unintelligible the first time through. After reading Ake, I was looking forward to reading Soyinka's lectures. To my disappointment, they weren't  lectures. They were sermons delivered to a room full of PhDs. If you  already know a good deal about Africa and are not afraid to have to read a  book two or three times, then this book has some interesting ideas 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
  think Janov's book The Primal Scream is too full of unscientific jumps of logic. His assertion that it is only logical to pursue pain to reverse the effects of pain is simplistic. Even if it is true that in the forward direction, trauma causes psychological problems (true I think, and important), it does not neccessarily mean the reverse is obviously true - that to reexperience pain will lead to a joyful existence that resembles the joy of young children. In my experience, the results from primal therapy also shine doubt on Janov's assertions. It is a pity, because so much of the book is valuable and important, for example the emphasis of love, and the criticisms of robotically extinguishing behaviors with behaviorism (not all behaviorism is bad though) are all good. But Janov's theory is taken to the extremes in his books, and by his followers, spoiling the valid points that they make. For example, gentle births and avoiding birth traumas are noble and correct causes. However, claiming that ALL psychological problems may have birth trauma as the underlying cause is pushing it too far. Suggesting reliving birth over and over again will reverse the effects of birth is also getting wacky. (this is found more in Janovs books after 1971). Janovs works have a tendency to draw you in with true and emotional themes, but they take you too far into his single deterministic model, and get you beleiving in things that are not proven, and actually unlikely. His model of understanding fails in some circumstances (as do all the grand theories), and in some cases evidence exists that contradicts some of the theory (for example modern research on surgery suggested mammals do better WITH pain medication, in the Primal Scream Janov suggested avoiding pain meds wherever possible, something I thing he may now disagree with, but has made no formal retraction).  I would recommend learning about all the models in psychology to put this work in context, and look at all the recent data in the field 1990 to 2006. Despite Janov's attack on Freud, Primal is a derivative of Freudian work, with some of the similar problems and benefits that come from that model. The worst thing you could do is wrap yourself in a primal blanket, and think psychology's rejection of this work is somehow repressed or a conspiracy. Mainstream psychology would correctly argue that the evidence is mostly case study from a specific skewed population of Janov followers, at a specific time in their optimism and therapy cycle. Similar miraculous reports are found in spiritual healing practices, again with believer's testimony being emphasised and published when it is positive.  In addition, rememeber this work was written a long time ago, and the diatribe against other psychological treatments is out of date (and in part unfair even at the time). However some of the criticisms of other treatments were valid, and important.  Use scientific and critical thinking to make your own decisions about this work. It's not all wrong, if you have your wits about you and you filter the information, it could help fill your life with love and improve the life of your children. Janov is right, love is the most important thing is raising children, and he does a good job of defining love between an parent and child.  On the other hand, if you take all of it to heart, and to the extreme, and then go on to destroy all relations with your family, create false memories, and spend decades trying to cry, scream and holding your breath in birth primals, it might just spoil your life.  It could go either way, so think independently for yourself.  Consider too, I may be wrong, so look at all the data with a critical eye, and draw on all areas of psychological research for clues.  
 This book is not even worth turning the first page!  This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written, poorly edited, and well...... words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him, Herriot his due, the man could write well and could tell a great story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?).  This guy though, Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding the paper into his typewriter!  The entire book is such a obvious ploy to make some quick money on the shirttail of a "dead" but popular author it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, my thinking being with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of the library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly  would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here.  I just hate having to give this one even one star.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I love that they came up with a Colorform set for this.  I am disappointed, however, by how expensive it is for what you get.  This set costs almost $10 after shipping.  I found one at our pharmacy for $3.50 a week later!  The stickers don't stick well and you can't get them to stay on the "storage sheet".  The background for the stickers to go on is too small and done "portrait style", when it should be "landscape". This toy is still played with and enjoyed, but I wish I had paid a lot less for it 
 Those not familiar with the sources of the various Celtic traditionsmay receive the impression that this book presents authentic ideas andcustoms in context. It does not. Instead, it presents Ms. Freeman'sNew Agey, Jungian-filtered interpretation of the sources. ThoughMs. Freeman reads widely, she uses her sources selectively to supporther notion of who the Celts were and are, rather than letting theevidence lead her to justifiable conclusions. This is unfortunate. Thebook is beautiful but it only re-inforces modern misconceptions aboutCeltic culture. It does not give the reader a true picture of thediverse cultures of the various Celtic peoples. (... 
 As a recently reunited adoptee experiencing a broad range of emotions, I looked to this book to help aid in the healing process.  I just did not like the writing style.  In this book, Lifton describes the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a few as being universal.  I was looking for validation of my feelings rather than more reasons to become angry and resentful - which is what happened with this book.  The final straw for me was reading Lifton's words, "...adoption is abortion after birth." I quickly discovered this book was going to do nothing for me except make me angry and resentful toward others for my "plot in life" rather than helping me work through my feelings about MYSELF.  If you are looking to get a grip on, and understand, your feelings, you should check out the book "Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self."  This book doesn't put ideas in your head, but instead helps you work through the ones you already have, in an easy to read, comforting manner.   
 Did that person actually read this book?   Green Melusine and I must be kindred spirits - I came here intending to make EXACTLY the same points! First of all, reading the back cover was what made up my mind to buy this book. It sounded like a fun and funny read about a young woman who tries to change her life and personality after she catches her boyfriend cheating on her. Instead, she spends the rest of the book whining and starting even more dysfunctional relationships, one after the other. Trina does not change or develop AT ALL, and that was disappointing.   Most disturbing, however, was the overall message. I don't know what points the author wanted to get across, but it seemed to me that she spent most of the book complaining that the outlook is grim for single women in their thirties - the only available guys are into disturbing sex games, or they have STDs. The moral of the story was that it's better to return to the guy who cheats on you (hey! He SAID he wouldn't do it again!) than to develop a shred of self esteem and show him the door, since the pickings are so slim. WHAT?  Despite the annoying protagonist and infuriating ending, I'm giving White Bikini Panties two stars, since it's fairly well written and there are some interesting moments (while I was sick of Trina by the book's end, I found myself absorbed by the subplot involving her older sister Jessie, and Jessie's struggle with infertility. Although it is also implied that Jessie can do no better than to settle for a cheating husband... hmmm...) If you really NEED another light chick lit read, this one will pass the time. However, if you're like me and your shelves are overflowing with this kind of book, don't bother adding this to the collection.   
 I found this system disorganized, inefficient and ultimately ineffective for learning Spanish.   There is too much English on the tape and very little conversational or cultural context.  A good system would have dialog presented in context with lots of repetition and building drills and minimal English explanation on tape.  Or maybe put the explanation on separate CD tracks so that it can be skipped after it is heard a time or two.   By the way, the CD tracks seemed to be cut-up randomly and had very little flow or consistency.    I have not tried any of the other systems but this one was a disappointment 
 I'm a Pagan, and I do not hold this book in high esteem.  And there is plenty I could say about the book and its author.  I've tried to do that in a couple of Amazon reviews.  But they were deleted, so if you really want to know what I think of this book, you will have to e-mail me 
 I hated this book.  I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to read something that wasn't the typical.... but the author's take on everything is so negative that I couldn't stand to read it.  She indicates you're doomed to get fat, your doomed to be uncomfortable, you're doomed to have an idiot spouse/partner, etc.  People like this author give pregnancy a bad name.  Yes, it has its moments of being uncomfortable, icky, etc., and if you choose to focus on all that, like this author does, you'll also be miserable.  I chose not to be 
 If you have read Richard Lamb's book, Mussolini as Diplomat, then there's no point of buying this book as it essentialy covers the same ground, and comes to the same conclusions. What's more, even if the former is a dry, boring read, it's still a bargain at $5 for  a hardcover 
 I just got my pair of sandals.I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying. Although very cute and trendy sandles, but are very uncomfortable 
 This is a good book if you are twelve years old, or know nothing about vegan or vegetarianism.  I stopped reading on page 42 at the line "Carnivores are physically designed to hunt, kill and devour their quarry quickly and painlessly."  Right.  Being ripped apart by teeth and claws doesn't hurt at all.  This book is repetitive of basic ideas and contains such biased and unrealistic fantasys.  Don't get me wrong - I am trying to transform myself into a vegan.  I believe it is the right way to live.  There are just better books out there about veganism 
 For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses  as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time 
 Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.  I understand the necessity and the desire to "update" old hits from one's singing career to make them "sing" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.  The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.  If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the "Heartbreaker" and "Deja Vu" period.  But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements.  
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 You guessed it.  I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book.  I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do.  Sorry 
 Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing.     First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones.     Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope.     Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser "On Writing Well," which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, "On Writing"; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing.. 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 This book has excellent pictures, but the text could cure insomnia. While its useful to have some guidelines as to where to cut when if this is your first time in anatomy lab, you might be better off letting your lab partners buy this one and getting a bigger and better reference book instead. I highly recommend the entertaining anatomy books from Sudz publishing by Chris Pasquini 
 Though I like "Pattern Hatching" in it, I dislike this book 
 I reviewed "Lost in the Amazon," which was released last summer.  Now, I find that "Lost in the Amazon" is just a re-titled version of "Extreme Exposure."  "Lost in the Amazon" was at best improperly titled since the expedition remains on course for the duration of the trip. It is indeed an adventureless story that the author has attempted to refashion into a life threatening ordeal.  In short, the book about Kilpatrick's plodding through the jungle and he's bothered by bugs, the heat and the rain.  If that's not bad enough, Kilpatrick is a Christian fundementalist and if I had a choice between enduring his religious diatribes and being bitten by the voracious bugs I'd choose the bugs every time 
 My business card says "software engineer" but I code very little. This book is the text for an introductory computer science course I am taking. While I admire the authors' attempt at putting Objects First in the curriculum, they have only succeeded in confusing and alienating a number of my classmates with little programming experience. The most glaring weaknesses are the the relatively few, undistinguished examples, and the lack of rigor in teaching Java syntax and semantics. The authors' freely admit that they do not attempt to teach Java itself, but this ultimately leaves students stranded as they peruse the hundreds of Java titles at the local bookstore, looking for a decent language reference. Lastly, they mix a lot of software engineering practice in with the actual computer science. While topics such as programming by contract and software quality are important, I am not convinced that this material is suited for students at the beginning level 
 I bought this book because I found Bayle's works confusing and difficult to approach.  This book - with its very promissing title - is just as confusing and unapproachable.  It certainly was of no help to me 
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 This book deserves credit for addressing men's needs for good sex, but is hit and miss for women.  A quote from the book:      "We men have taken a lot of heat in recent years for our attitudes about sex.  We are told that we are obsessed with sex, expecially sex without love and commitment; that we push too hard for it and in inapproporate ways in both new and old relationships; and that we pout when we don't get what we want.  Such attitudes, we are told, are immature and maybe downritght sick.  But I think the criticisms themselves are wrongheaded and destructive.  Males can't help having their attitiudes, which are probably due at least as much to physiology as to learning.  Sex, afterall is live affirming, and there's no point in feeling bad about that."  End quote.  I believe that men have often hurt women (and their relationships with women) to fullfill their sexual urges, but author severely downplays this as if it were uncommon and less harmful than it actually is.     The author gives a role-playing example on how to deal with conflict: MAN:  I find myself in a strange place.  I agree with you that it's your body and I shouldn't touch you in ways you don't like.  So I'll do my best not to touch your breast roughly.  But I can't guarantee never to do it.  What feels rough to you comes from a strong feeling of lust.  I'm not sure I can always catch this impluse before I grab you.  I think I can do it most of the time.  But there my still be a few occaisions when I don't catch myself in time.  I may already be squeezing your breast before I remember.  It would help me a lot to know that you're not going to get upset if that happens occasionally.  Maybe you could just remind me of what I'm doing.    End quote.  In my opinion the woman SHOULD get upset to the degree that it makes her feel violated.  If it does not bother her much, a reminder is all that is needed.  But what if it really does hurt her?  Women are very vulnerable during sex, and we need to feel safe. I would feel less safe with a man who read this book.   
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Really lousy, I've seen better watching a movie about a volcano. At least it is more accurate in the destruction. Any tornado movie is lacking in the destruction department, most of the tornado movies I seen is of a twister following the main character. Yea real accurate, since when did a tornado chase people around. Like they said in the movie, it has a devil's heart and as soulless as the Grim Reaper it dont have a brain. Here's some advice for the movie creators, Dont and I repeat DONT make a tornado follow a big movie star. It is real boring, I think many people agree with me 
 I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.    Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us 
 Dry and overly technical.  As an aspiring lawyer and an armchair orator, I didn't find very much that I could readily apply to the nuts and bolts of my speech writing or delivery 
 Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.   Actually, this is a Hollywood "message movie," and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.   There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of "lao wei in China" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.   AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.   As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name "Sam Francisco" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.   I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.    
 Awful, NOT a book to read to children. . . really opjectional 
 First off I like Bolton's early work in the late 70's to mid 80's.Bolton's first albums Blackjack 1979, Worlds Apart 1980, Michael Bolton 1983, and Everybody's Crazy 1985 were all pretty good melodic rockers, but this is the end.Soul provider is the beginning of a soul failure. The only good songs on here are How can we be Lovers and You wouldn't know Love.These songs have a catchy chorus and rock somewhat.The rest of the album is garbage. Why did you sell out Bolton? It's such a shame what could of been.If Bolton stayed on the melodic metal/rock path he would be a rocker still to this day and most likely a dam good one like he was in the early to mid 80's. It's a cryin shame 
 The complaints about the pepper grinder squeaking and spitting out huge chunks of peppercorns are 100% true. Try to avoid this one if you can. I would try to get a refund, but it's just not worth the hassle. What a waste 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 This is the worst magazine I have ever subscribed too.  I hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came, I thru it right in the trash.  Here why:  1- Ad after ad for dietary supplements (like dexatrim and stacker) which i think cheapins the creditablity of the magazine b/c true health doesnt come from a bottle.  2- Many pics of overly built up women (think fitness competitions)...not something the average women can aspire too...and too me, is nasty looking.  3-The information that was in it is general information that anyone with common sense already know!  My advice to you, AVOID THIS MAGAZINE, unless you like body building or like looking at body builders 
 There is nothing in this book except the track plans and in some plans it is difficult to find out the square feet required.  Nothing on building the layout.  For $9 you might be able to use one plan.  It's not really a book, it's a phamplet 
 Professor Jenkins has written with insight and clarity on a number of controversial topics, unfortunately, while this book raises some important points, it is rather tendentious compared to his past works. At one point, he claims that the Clinton Administration's Health Security Initiative failed to make it into law because of the Administration's petty aversion to having the Catholic Church as an ally. This strange assertion will come as news to many, including Theda Skocpol, author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the Clinton health care proposal. Elsewhere, Professor Jenkins explores the pedigree of anti-Catholic prejudice in America in depth, but he fails to do the same for Vatican hostility to the United States which has a long pedigree of its own. Despite the good feelings towards the Catholic Church in the United States at independence (due in part to French aid against the British) and the disestablishment of Protestant churches, the Vatican regarded the U.S. "as the bastard brat of Jacobinism" (to quote Samuel Eliot Morison) and warned against the heresy of "Americanism". This hostility persisted right up until the papacy of John XXIII. Also, during the 19th century, the Vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion, freedom of thought, and freedom of conscience. This hostility persisted right up until the Second Vatican Council. Unfortunately, while none of the Vatican II reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of John Paul II, they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old Soviet constitution.   Nevertheless, it is deplorable that Roman Catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents. Such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. But the proper reaction to outrages committed against Catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice. There is an immense and inordinate effort by the Vatican in some countries (e.g., Poland, Italy, the United States) to manipulate civil-statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law. Even when the Vatican's efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people, (as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease) its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved. Although the authoritarian inclination of the Church is not a crime, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity. When the Church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies, or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right, neither the Vatican nor Professor Jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational and violent reactions increase. Therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination, lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the U.S. Constitution is a morally acceptable option. It is not.   With all this in mind, decent Catholics should ask their Bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure American law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens, even while claiming not to do so. A careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative Catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead Catholics and the general public alike. For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws. Its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society. Some of these groups will use the word "democratic" to describe either the organization or its intended actions, yet they do not defend and promote the interests of American society; indeed, they even openly attack it. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to American liberty and pluralism. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a 'sacral state' ideology that denies the democratic nature of the United States, as well as the rights of every individual. This does not mean that conservative Catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion, but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens, they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self-indulgent.   Jesus promised, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free" (Jn. 8:32). Conservative Catholics (including the hierarchy here and in the Vatican) should have the truth about American society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly. After all, without the defeat of Nazism and U.S. opposition to Soviet communism, the young Karol Wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff. There has never been a society in human history that afforded so many--Catholics included--the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the United States. However, Catholics must be trustworthy custodians of other's freedoms as well as their own. Perhaps Professor Jenkins's next book can take up this challenge 
 WARNING: SPOILERS   Zora (Sanaa Lathan) is an aspiring singer and song-writer recently moved to Brooklyn.  She meets Franklin (Wesley Snipes) a  carpenter as she is moving in to her newly renovated brownstone. Sparks fly between the two and they quickly wind up in bed.  This movie is pretty standard up to this point and then we learn more about the characters.  We find out Franklin is married (though separated), has two children (but rarely pays child support) and has not managed to finish high school (though he is well-spoken and can play a mean game of Scrabble).    Now for some women the breaking point to a relationship  with a guy would be finding out he is married with two kids.  In this movie?  No way.  Instead when Zora, a woman we think is intelligent, finds out these things about Franklin she is initially upset but quickly "gets over it" and even invites "Fast Frankie" to live with her.  When he lets her know that he can't even afford to split the rent with her she doesn't mind!  Instead she gives him the keys to her home and tells him not to worry about. This is first of the many improbable events that occur in this film.   Once Zora stupidly allows Fast Frankie into her home and life she gets pregnant and seriously contemplates abortion.  She makes the decision to go ahead with it and in a distasteful scene argues with  Fast Frankie as he begs her not to "kill his baby".  Of course Zora being Zora she decides to go ahead with having a baby with Franklin (who barely takes care of the kids he already has).  Franklin resolutely promises that he will take care of Zora and the baby and will work THREE JOBS if he has too.  The story progresses and Zora is heavily pregnant and it appears Franklin keeps his word as he finds a steady gig at a unionized construction site.    Things go well until Franklin drinks on the job, falls down injuring himself and is ultimately fired. Zora has the baby and since Franklin is too proud to accept work from his father or former boss, Zora carries the entire family financially. Keep in mind she works full-time as a music teacher, is pursuing a music career and, oh yeah, has recently had a son she has to care for.  Although Franklin doesn't have a job and won't go look for work because, as he explains it, "it's too cold" he doesn't try to cook, clean or change wet baby diapers.  That of course is women's work.    It is at this stage that we finally see some hope for this hopeless story of strange love.  Zora finally gets fed up and asks Franklin to leave.  Even in this though she makes a mistake.  After telling Franklin to pack his things and go, she leaves the house with their child.  When she returns she finds that Franklin, in a drunken self-pitying stupor, has completely trashed her home.  We see scenes where Franklin takes his hammer and rips everything he has built.  He breaks  down a coat rack, a mantle, a book case, etc.  Now, as the viewer, you can only believe that Fast Frankie, a selfish waste of space, is a truly terrible person. He trashes the home where his own child lives!  Honestly, who is this person!? Thankfully this is near the end of the film.  We see Zora getting on with life alone with her son.  She appears lonely in scenes, although after her ordeal with  Fast Frankie you would think she would be shouting with glee.  But not in this movie, no she is lonely without her shiftless man.  When Franklin knocks on Zora's door out of the blue one day, she is surprised (as are we). We hear that Franklin has been sending money to her for their son (I guess $20 can go toward diapars).  It's been over a year (!) and Franklin wants to see his son.  Later Zora and Franklin talk about things and we find out Franklin is taking an exam to become a licensed contractor.  Zora is suitably impressed because this means Franklin now has his GED (and boy is he proud of himself).  Zora can't believe the changes in Franklin (hmmm...he received his diploma for high school equivalency and he isn't drunk, what accomplishments) and looks at him with new eyes.  Their visit over, Franklin walks down the stairs leaving Zora to further contemplate the new Franklin.  A few seconds later she rushes to the stairs and calls him back up to the apartment.  The final scene of the film finds Zora and Franklin sitting happily with their son playing their favorite game, Scrabble.    Once you see this final scene, you can't help but be confused and disgusted.  Although I think the acting and directing in this film are outstanding, the characters and story line are deeply disturbing.  This film is based on a book written by Terry McMillan, an author that has made a career of writing about the desperate and curiously crazy behavior of middle-class black women in relationships.  I am not a fan of  Ms. McMillan, but I am a fan of Gina Prince-Bythewood who I can only assume took on this project as a challenge but could not quite pull off overseeing a film that makes black women appear incredibly self-deluding and obsessed with being in a relationship (any kind of relationship) even to their detriment.  If you want to see a well acted and directed feature, this is for you.  However, the movie itself is incredibly infuriating and disturbing in its portrayal of an adult woman being so completely blinded by the insecurity and fear of being alone.  I would not recommend the film for content, except as a cautionary tale. 
 The slippers look nice and smell great.  They were difficult for me to get on my feet.  The lining was too restrictive.  Once they were on, they were very awkward and uncomfortable to take any steps. It's unlikely that I will ever use them on my feet.  I will only use the inserts for aromatherapy 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 Occasional insights obscured by thickets of doctrinaire Freudianism. Let the reader beware 
 I was eager to receive this bible because the reviews were favorable.  I am very dissapointed in this product.  I purchased the leather indexed edition which has no margins for notes, is very small (aprox. 9 x 6) and looks more like a thin-line bible then a bible which costs over $50.00.  I have many bibles and this is the worst quality by far.  Very dissapointed with Zondervan 
 The Black Fleet Crisis was bad.  The Cestus Deception was not outstanding.  I found Triple Zero lacking (especially compared to the exceptional Hard Contact).  The Jedi Quest series took almost the entire series to make the journey worthwhile.  But all these books pale in comparison to what I would call the worst Star Wars book (I have read almost all of them except for the newest ones). First off, Nejaa Halcyon was the biggest reason I started reading this book.  I read of him in I, Jedi and longed to know more.  I should have made up my own story since the authors don't really do much with him.  He could have been any Jedi; there was nothing that made him exceptional. Next, the authors have a weird view of what people want.  They seem to think that we, the audience, would love to read pages of insignificant, brainless, unimportant characters with terrible names, strategy, and the like and not detail important things like Anakin and Nejaa's marriages (the whole interchange, which could have lasted half a chapter with Michael Stackpole as the author, takes up half a page), lightsaber battles, and real character development. Other pet peeves: 1. I was unimpressed with the juvenile writing style. 2. I could care less for the whole mercenary angle and the Rodian mercenary (both of whom did not stay consistent throughout the story).  They felt like blank characters with not much depth. 3. Odi and Erk, Erk and Odi, them getting married...gag me!  Please!  I groaned when I read "And now by the powers vested in me..." at the end!  How could anyone end a Star Wars novel in such a hokey marriage.  I would have omitted their entire story from this novel and given that time to Anakin and Nejaa. 4. Asajj Ventress on the cover and not in the book (to my knowledge). 5. Super motherly woman who is about to die.  And she reminds Anakin of Shmi.  Do I sense a billboard or something? 6. Ponith, the scary banker with purple teeth from all that tea he drinks.  And we are supposed to fear him why? 7. I never really believe the whole mission was important.  If this station was so important to interstellar communications, how did this happen in the first place? Just so I don't sound too negative, the end picked up a bit.  The action was a bit better.  Also, some inclusion of clone troopers (but nothing compared to Hard Contact). 7.99 is about 7.98 too much for this book.  Buy used or borrow.  In fact, don't bother.  Just skip.  Watch the Clone Wars animated shorts for Anakin's real trial.  And spend the 7.99 on Hard Contact for a much better Clone Wars novel 
 Other than the chapter on the Driods, this book is not worth your time.  Better to read Kip Thorne.  How the author could have taken such interesting subjects and made them some uninteresting is somewhat amazing.   Don't read this 
 If you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and 80's production quality, than this cd is for you. Other than that, you have to ask yourself why it was $10 at Walmart as stated by a previous review. (hint: not because it was a hidden gem)I couldn't give this less than a star because of the song selection. That is all this cd has going for it. So read the songs, enjoy it for what it is worth, move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this. (All in that order) Sorry drew, now go back to the drawing board 
 Come on, Sony.  I'm a computer programmer and I can't get your secretly installed software off my computer!  Jane had one of the most beautiful voices on the planet but I won't be listening to it on my DELL DJ because if I rip it, I end up with Sony stealing a bit of my hard drive.  CAREFUL EVERYONE 
 Anyone who believes in magic in this enlightened era is pathetic.  I only wish I could give it negative stars.  Poorly written and edited, it is even more a waste of time than Rowling's drivel 
 Not enough rock and roll. Only three songs were any good. But the one's I liked were great 
 Anita Shapira's New Republic essay, "The Past is Not a Foreign Country," (online) decimates this book. Adding to Efraim Karsh's 1996 study (Fabricating Israeli History), she reminds readers that Morris failed to reply. He ignored 50 Karsh references to his own work, Avi Shlaim, primary sources and major historical and journalistic studies.   In this work, Morris ironically refers to many of Karsh's sources, but nevertheless arrives at incorrect conclusions. The book is thus a politically charged revision of the Israeli-Arab conflict covering the pre-1948 through the history of Arab wars on Israel. The book shows culprits and casualties, and blames Arab regimes for violent incursions into Israel in the 1950s, for the secret war between Israel and terrorist groups, for Naser's threat to Israel before the Sinai and Six-Day wars, and for many Arab calls for Israel's destruction. Morris even notes that Israel's West Bank and Gaza rule "was never as restrictive or repressive as the Palestinians made out."   One big problem is Morris' large reliance on Israeli and secondary sources. He consults only a few primary Arab documents (and those, only in English translation), thus all but ignoring available Arab memoirs and state files. Oddly, Morris exploits every Israeli contingency plan and idea as conclusive evidence of Zionist expansionism, but ignores Arab plans for a "Greater Syria" as well as King Hussein's designs.   Another is Morris' exclusion of regional effects of the cold war, and Soviet arms that poured into Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab states, worsening Arab-Israeli relations from the 1950s on. In short, Morris ignores the fact that the opportunity for Arab-Israeli peace opened up only following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Arab hard-liners without support for their traditional rejections.   Worse, Morris misconstrues the notorious topic of " transfer," a term commonly used between the two world wars to describe population exchanges like that between Turkey and Greece in the 1920s. In his first work on that topic, Morris rightly concluded that the "Palestinian refugee problem was born of war, not by design, Jewish or Arab," but was (rather) a by-product of both people's fears and the protracted, bitter fighting of the first Arab-Israeli war. But that conclusion provoked attacks from Arab historians and Israeli revisionists.   Whatever the reason, Morris in this book reverses his earlier conclusion, standing history on its head. He makes effect into cause, and falsely translates the results of war into a paradigm for Arab-Jewish relations. He writes, "fear of territorial displacement and dispossession was to be the chief motor of Arab antagonism to Zionism down to 1948 (and indeed after 1967 as well)."   This reading libels Zionism and its foundations.   Actually, the Peel Commission first proposed, in 1937, to transfer the Arab minority from territory designated for the tiny Jewish state as part of a planned partition of western Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Morris presumes that Zionist leaders "played a role in persuading the Peel Commission to adopt the transfer solution." But he provides zero proof.   In fact, Ben-Gurion welcomed the British idea only to persuade Zionists to accept a tiny Jewish state (and the proposed partition)--but also warned of its inherent dangers. Furthermore, Zionist leaders believed that a Jewish majority would come from massive immigration, and that Western Palestine could accommodate millions of Jews and Arabs. History proved them right on that score, although the peace they expected remains ever-elusive.  The Arabs initiated war in 1948 in preference to accepting a Jewish state--and thought they could win. And everywhere they prevailed, Arabs expelled every last Jew. Benny Morris should get real.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 There's a regressively narrow perspective signalled through the use of the outdated trope of the "dandy." The dandy is a figure so cut off from community and place that it Romantically spirals away into never-never land. By using a gender framework, the argument seems more realistically grounded than it is 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this 
 This book is about as clear as 12 inches of lead when it comes to explaining concepts.  The author spends half of the text on digression bordering on preaching.  Variables are introduced with vague explanations as a rule.  There are tons of equations in this book with little or no explanation.  Terms are regularly defined and then used differently then previously defined.  The organization makes it of absolutely no use as a reference.  If you must buy this book for college, make sure it is in good saleable condition when you're done because keeping it would be stupid 
 I purchased this book to gain a better insight about Aspergers.  Instead, it left me with many unanswered questions.  The book is the equivalent to a boring, monotonous `Dear Diary' that gets stuck in one era: His college years and his interest in music.  (This is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college, & music is all he knows.)  Yet I craved more details, I wanted to know more about Mr. Shores' childhood, his parents, the stims, and the chaos...DETAILS!  It felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is, boasting of his accomplishments and how he's almost neurotypical.  His failures were blamed on other people out to get him for unknown reasons.  Lets say it for what it is: A man who looks kind of disheveled and a bit `odd' (Unabomber) gets a job in a financial institution, he rides his bike in, hangs out in the shadows getting dressed, doesn't socialize - and no one wants him around.  It's BECAUSE HE'S WEIRD!  Yet the author blames his co-workers.  I'm sorry but the reality is, the author probably can't see and understand that he IS different because he has Aspergers!   I mean, most typical people can spot someone that is odd/weird/different a mile away.  They avoid them not because they're being hurtful, they just can't relate to that person.   I wished he had focused in much greater detail about his feelings, emotions and behaviors when he was younger-to gain a better understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now.  The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his entire youth and got stuck on `pause' when he got to college.  While this is obsessively interesting to him, it was tiring reading page after page of redundant accounts of his college days.   There is no depth to the book, it was shallowly written and there is not enough elaboration to make me understand, (or want to for that part) what makes Stephen Shore the person he is.  While this may be due in part to his disorder, it left so much to be desired.   I'm sorry to anyone who takes offense to this review, as this is not my intention.  I applaud Mr. Shores accomplishments and the hurtles he's overcome.  He must be MUCH more dimensional than the book conveys.   I wanted to know more about HIM and not what he's done in his life.  I'd suggest a better read would be one of Temple Grandin's books.  I got a true feeling of who she is and an understanding of how she got there and how autism fits in.  She goes into details about what she was thinking as a girl, teenager and adult.  Her pranks, her temper, the metaphors and their importance..everything.  I bought this book based on reviews, and I felt it necessary to give mine. 
 I'm a yoga teacher, about to teach a prenatal class.  I bought this book because Judith Lasater is an excellent teacher and I hoped to get some ideas for my class.  The 23 pages of this book devoted to prenatal yoga were quite helpful.  I just expected more.  This is billed as a Rodmell Press "Yoga Shorts" and it is. The book would probably be most helpful for a pregnant woman who is new to yoga.  She would learn 6 poses, 3 of them supported.  For everyone else, I'd recommend going with Lasater's RELAX AND RENEW 
 Sir, When you get yourself a degree then maybe just maybe I may think about buying this trash. Until that time from my readings PTSD has been tracked for over a century and a half ...so whats your problem?  Get rich  quick scams....only in America 
 ALL of these discs are such poor quality that they continually freeze in any DVD player.  No wonder they're so cheap, you get what you pay for 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.   
 I was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books, especially five dysfunctions of a team, which is one of the most elegant frameworks i've seen on team dynamics.  lencioni's solution to silos and politics?  a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics.  it's a lot more complex than just that, and i'm surprised he didn't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership, which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem.  if you're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization, keep looking.. 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim) 
 Key points:  1. One should read Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) before reading "Ready for Anything" (RFA).    2. If you've read GTD, you can probably skip RFA.  It reinforces some core GTD principles, often in a mind-numbingly repetitive fashion (which can be a good teaching style), but also tries to fill in some of "The Vision Thing" content absent in GTD.  Unfortunately, Covey is better than Allen in addressing "The Vision Thing."  Together, GTD plus Covey's "7 Habits" and "First Things First" (FTF) make an interesting collection.    3. RFA suffers from the same design and layout issues I found with GTD: the "inspirational quotations"  in the margins destroy the reading flow as they push into the space occupied by the main text.  The quotes distract the reader from the main text due to their intrusion into such and a lack of white space. IMO, there are too many inspirational quotes.  Allen should have simply started each chapter with one relevant quote, ala Covey's "7 Habits..."  I've noticed that some of the inspirational quotes are recycled from GTD and are sometimes better than the associated essay in RFA.  To see how to place quotes or references in the margins of a book's pages, Allen should review any of Edward Tufte's books, such as "Beautiful Evidence."    4. There are obvious parallels throughout RFA to ideas in Covey's "7 Habits" and "First Things First."  However, there's no mention of Covey in the book (and he's only cited once in GTD via an inspirational quote).  Both Covey and Allen have interesting things to teach, but it seems Allen eschews any reference to Covey despite the obvious parallels to anyone who has read both authors.  In some cases, it seems Allen is taking pot-shots at Covey ideas, such as his reference to the "quadrant matrix" on page 22 of the paperback edition of RFA, an obvious reference to Covey's Urgent/Important matrix in FTF.  5. RFA makes no attempt to indicate when the included essays were originally published in Allen's newsletter.  It would be interesting to know when the original essay was published.  I'm sure they've been edited and updated for the book, but some connection to their stated original publication dates might be helpful in understanding where Allen was in his personal journey at the time he wrote the essay.  6. The "By the way..." items at the end of each RFA chapter may be valuable for readers who've not yet asked themselves some of the deeper questions or who are struggling with their GTD implementation.  7. IMO, the GTD Workflow chart, in a revised form in RFA, still needs work.  Perhaps they should not try to fit it on one page: use a two-page spread or, even better, a fold-out that one can also tear out.  The chart would benefit from the help of someone who knows how to draw flowcharts.  8. The paper in the paperback edition of  RFA is of a cheap, inferior quality compared to that used in the paperback edition of GTD.  To me, it feels like cheap newsprint.  9. RFA lacks an index.  A book like this, without an index, is most unfortunate, indicating perhaps a rush job to capitalize on GTD interest by recycling old essays.  Recycling content for additional profit is a good idea, but any book like this should include an index 
 In a world desperate for health solutions, the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have  not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity.  Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.  Careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women, it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.  Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.    Elsewhere, mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.  Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake, then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.    Alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.  You might as well drink battery acid he said, the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.  Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.  He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system, the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.  The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.  The alkaline promoters, including this book's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes.  Read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program 
 I saw this atrocity at an I-max cinema. I wish I hadn't. The whole thing is something of a travesty of the original Fantasia. The musical selection is humdrum and conservative - compared to the original. The imagery and animation is pleasant but unexciting. The guest spots are embarrassing and twee.   If you have an interest in seeing something special done with music and images, check out Christine Schï¿½fer's "One Night. One Life" or Christian Chaudet's DVD of Stravinsky's "Le Rossignol".  Don't bother with this atrocious Neo-Con / Religious Right world vision. In the original we had Stravinsky at his wildest and dinosaurs and in this we have Noah's friggin' Ark and Elgar at his most stodgy and conservative. There is an almost tangible pusillanimousness about this Fantasia 2000 "thing" which I found most distasteful.  Let us hope that this idea stops with this one - or maybe they should hand the whole thing over to someone else to do? Maybe Miyazaki? Or some European directors?  Fantasia 2000 isn't fantastic or much of a fantasy, to tell the truth. 
 I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large.. 
 Walking the Bible (I do not have the book that the DVD is a companion to) to me was, in a word, vague.  For example, the scene standing atop Mt Nebo, made on a foggy day showed little and told little of the significance of that place.  How far from Jerusalem was it?  What are the other mountains like nearby are they taller, shorter, or the same height? Which way is Jerusalem?  Is that the Dead Sea off in the distance? What can be seen from there on a clear day? What cannot be seen because the mountain is too low? What is the land like there for farming in comparison to what is across the river?  Where did Israel cross over from there?, was it in a place where Moses could have witnessed?  The DVD has a Bible reading and some spiritual comments, but that is it. 
 Having seen the exhibit behind the book, I looked forward to reviewing the many gorgeous paintings I saw.  Although the text in the book is fine, the pictures are alas not.  Many are in black and white, but the real  disappointment came in the color reproductions where things were really  second rate, looking more suitable for postcards than a fine art book.  I  returned my copy to Amazon, and I would suggest you save your money unless  there is no other way you will see some of his work.  Very disappointing 
 First of all, if you're serious about out-of-body or lucid dreaming check out "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce. That's the bible. Now, "Conscious Dreaming" consists of personal stories and some shamanic rituals, but lacks power techniques for advanced dreamers. Anyway it's ok for beginners, who seek motivation for out-of-body exploration. It's also recommended by Marc VanDeKeere in his excellent "The Ultimate Lucid Dreamer's Manual: From Basics to Beyond" 
 Don't get false hope people! This is not a cure! All this book talks about is Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Cold Compresses, Retin A, etc STUFF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT! I followed his directions exactly and I ended up with worse skin than before. I was red, peeling, itchy and still broken out. I have given up on finding a cure, I will probably have acne til the day I die. 
 Ehhh, well here goes... some of this is decent. I say that with a fair amount of self-consciousness since Staind isn't really taken that seriously these days - and rightfully so. But Dysfunction, for all its cliche nu metal-ness, has a unique gritty atmosphere and some decent tunes.  Early Staind is radio post-grunge crossed with a third rate Korn immitation, but it does have its charms. The guitarist borrows heavily from Korn's impressionistic chord-writing. Unlike a lot of radio bands these days, they didn't bury that strength (and the band's tone in general) under layers of sickeningly sweet production. In fact much of this record gets by on its sound rather than its songwriting. It seethes with frustration and the band have a good feel for each other.  I can't say Aaron Lewis's lyrics "seethe" with anything, unfortunately. They're mostly whiney mommy and daddy stories and his melodies aren't even that strong. This is another department in which Staind shamelessy robs their Korn forefathers blind. Lewis seems to have missed the point in Jonathan Davis's lyrics, seeing in his spit and bile an excuse to cry and moan. At the same time, the woe-is-me act does sort of add to the comedy of Staind in general.  It has some solid and catchy tunes, such as "Just Go", "Mudshovel" and "Home", and the rest is peppered with decent and occasionally inspired guitar riffs. The song structures are often haphazard and wander off track in uninteresting ways, but the vibe maintains throughout. It does what it does pretty well 
 I am sure Terri Jean is a well-meaning person. But this is the kind of book that makes native people throw up.  It tries to sell our spirituality for a profit.  She doesn't have any real understanding of anything other than a spiritual hunger and a desire to make money.  I am ashamed of this book 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 This book  has only a few pages of text/instructions.  Transfer designs are simplistic and none are illustrated.  No pictures; all in black and white.  I did give it two stars because it documents the basic embroidery stitches - although even they are not that clear.  IMHO - not worth the shipping and handling. 
 Although Goodman is generally attributed as on of the leaders of the Anti-Realist position, Ways of Worldmaking does not provide a good argument for that position.  Goodman's talk is highly open to interpretation, but  most interpretations lead to trivial truth or outlandishly bizarre  scenarios.  The lack of detailed argument makes refutation difficult, but  still it is a must read for those interested in what Anti-Realism is 
 No Doubt that Frank was a huge influence on my life ( who could imagine? )from the earliest Mothers. But this must appeal to guitar players more than me; I can listen to Robert Fripp, John McClaughlin and Jeff Beck for hours but this seems repetitive and boring. Can I end this review with an Apostrophe 
 I really wanted to like this film.  I love the biblical story and had looked forward sharing this film with my catechism class.  Unfortunately, I am not going to show it in class because it's not a good film.    The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible.  The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?).  I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed.  There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.    I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone.  This one unfortunately missed the mark 
 I loved "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country".  They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia.  I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation.  I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless.  I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited.  It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain.  I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England.  In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon.  If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself.  I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable 
 I am just beginning to read this book.  I just opened it and began reading the first tutorial.  It wants me to import a file into my flash 5 project from the CD-ROM that comes with the book.  I look into the contents of the CD...nothing!  The file "forest.gif" isn't even on the CD!  Just by the looks of it, it doesn't look like this book will be very good.  I mean, I just now started it!  To me, this is embarrasing to the authors.  Be careful what you buy folks.. 
 I purchased this DVD, and could not get it to play in my DVD player.  I sent it back for exchange, and received another identical disk that it too would not play.  I sent it back for a refund, and was never able to view it.  I never thought to try it in my computer, bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue. Oddly, the DVD has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all DVD players in the US.. 
 Anyone looking for the song "You're Just What I Need" featured in this movie can find the song on the CD "More Than A Lot" by Rufus King.  It's a very hard-to-find CD because the band didn't have a label but I found it on cdbaby.com.  Don't know if it's still for sale there or not but the CD is worth it 
 The mitten was a good book.It was a good wen thefunnest part when mitten blew.It was a good book at the end it was the funnyest part 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 The wire at the point where it connects with the mike is too fragile. After 3 months it has lost contact and is useless to me now. Fixing it is a hassle and the minimum bench charge at the Sony store is prohibative 
 I expected fast and flavorful recipes that might fit into a low processed carbs, high protein diet.  For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me.  Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it:  more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat.  (I've never said I wasn't picky.)  If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket.  I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying.  
  Hodgson(H)bases his entire argument on a version of the Antinomian fallacy(see D H Fischer's Historian's Fallacies,1970,Harper and Row,pp.94-97).This fallacy infects all of H's work on the interface between macroeconomics and institutions.Briefly,the antinomian fallacy argues that all events in history are unique.All inductive generalizations are false.It is impossible to learn from experience.Thus,no general theories are possible in the social sciences or liberal arts since institutions are constantly evolving over time during each specific historical period.H's version of the antinomian fallacy is that all periods of history are unique(specific).Period replaces event.This type of fallacious argument is endemic among "Cambridge Keynesians"(Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle,Tony Lawson,Geoffrey Hodgson,Victoria Chick,etc.)and American Post Keynesians(P. Davidson,D.Vickers,etc.).H incorrectly claims that Keynes's correct analysis showing that,due to technological change,advance and innovation over time,the study of the determinates of fixed investment in long lived ,physical ,durable capital goods is not homogeneous over time means that"...Keynes is inconsistent since this implies that economic theory must be related to historically specific material."(Hodgson,p.223)This simply does not follow,which explains why Keynes correctly ignored the historicists and institutionalists when it came time to write his General Theory in 1936.This is because the problem of investing in costly, fixed ,industry specific capital(factories,plant and equipment,etc.),which is irreversible and irrevocable once it is in place,has been a major decision problem since the dawn of history.The threat of technological obsolescence to the presently existing stock of capital by future innovations has occurred in the past and present and will occur in the future.Of course,there will be similarities and dissimilarities in different periods of history.Keynes has a general theory that explains why the private capital stock in every period of history will be suboptimal.It is suboptimal because investment is suboptimal in the private sector due to the uncertainty,ambiguity(D. Ellsberg's term)or lack of evidential weight(Keynes's term)of a sufficient amount of information upon which to plan such projects over a multiperiod future.This insufficiency then leads to involuntary unemployment.Of course,all this is far beyond the intellectual grasp of H.A similar conclusion applies to V.Chick,who H approvingly cites:"Chick's argument underlines the fact that the General Theory was not,in truth,a general theory(since) it applied to a historically specific set of capitalistic institutions".(p.224).Chick's fallacious statement is a very good example of the antinomian fallacy  
 ten years ago, this would have been a 4 star book, but you can sit down to Google and have all this and much more faster and in much greater depth.  It's a good toilet tank book, but that's about it 
 This novel has a great title. But, some of the intertwined characters that were fleshed out were absolutely cruel and unlikeable, others so unidimensional, that I didn't really want to know more about them, and didn't care as much as I should what happened to them. Donna and Peter deserved each other. What was there to like about Mike? I, too, was reminded of Margaret Atwood's style when reading this, but she's not one of my favorites either. To be fair, perhaps to really appreciate this book you had to have read it during the era in which it was written 
 After having read "The Mark of the Assassin" I was looking forward to read this follow up. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations. Even if the lead characters are all the same and the conflict in Northern Ireland is insightful and interesting the story is much simpler this time. Even worse - the way they bring down the Ulster Freedom Brigade is so simple and unrealistic it almost hurts. (Such a simple trap is all it takes? Give me a break...) After having finished this book I could not get rid of the feeling that the author quickly needed a follow-up to his big (and first) success and did not take enough time to develop a better story. Too bad, a wasted opportunity.. 
 The Four Seasons was my first novel by Mary Alice Monroe.     It's the story of the four Season sisters:  Jillian, Beatrice, Rose, and Meredith.  The novel opens when the sisters reunite for Merry's funeral, and it takes its shape from her final request - that they find the child, now an adult, that one of them gave up for adoption as a teen.   I confess that I didn't find anything unique or particularly interesting here.  Her theme seems to be the effect of the past on the present and the necessity to break down walls and 'share.'  I felt rather battered over the head by her heavy handed didacticism by the time I finished the novel, but at least I did finish it.   I suppose my verdict is 'so/so. 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 I had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea.  I don't know if it because I tend to like more horror type movies or what but I was really bored by them.  Each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way.  I know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense.  The movies were violent but nothing one hasn't seen before several times so I am not sure about the shock value of it...I wasn't shocked, disturbed or upset.........just bored 
 This book is an okay start.  It has less mistakes in it than the older edition, but there are still some.  It is definitely not enough preparation though.  
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 This story bored the dickens out of me.  The writing dragged on and on about subjects which were uninteresting and depressing.  I agree wholeheartedly with R. Farmer.  I am not a Pollyanna who only needs sunshine and smiley faces, but this was ridiculous.  The characters were stuck in boring places with no desire to make things better for themselves.  Talk but no action 
 Author Miles Harvey describes the bizarre world of map thieves (including explorers, cartographers, collectors and vandals) as "deliciously offbeat," and so it is. Perhaps a fascinating narrative on cartographic crime could be culled from these 350 pages. Sadly, Harvey  structured his book around Gilbert Bland, a petty crook whose life is remarkable only for its sheer dullness. With all the build-up in the introduction, the reader hopes for more.    Also, Harvey can't resist the urge to write about HIMSELF. He constantly interrupts mesmerizing tales of New World discovery with drivelly personal thoughts better confined to LiveJournal. Lest we forget, Harvey is a Professional Journalist On Assignment Interviewing People! And he likes maps, and his mother often cried when he stayed out late, blah blah blah.  Worst of all, Harvey constantly compares Bland and himself to reckless explorers like Pizarro, Fremont "the Pathfinder", Sir Walter Raleigh and even Christopher Columbus. Considering the absolute mediocrity of Harvey and Bland, such metaphors ring false and are in fact ludicrously disingenuous.  At one point Harvey describes the violent fates of certain explorers (including cannibalism, decapitation, mutiny and the murder of thousands). Then--with a straight face--he draws a parallel between these outrageous events and his own drive down I-85 to Hardee's.  I'm NOT kidding.  Harvey makes the case that he and Bland are similar people, and there I must agree. Both are utterly boring people. Bland conned dealers into buying stolen maps, while Harvey conned me into buying this book.  In short, the explorers and cartographers of old make for rich subject matter. Librarians and map collectors of the modern age do too, for the most part.  As for Bland, I cringed whenever his name popped up, and Harvey's self-indulgent reveries nearly drove me to hurl the book against a wall. Too bad "Island of Lost Maps" is mostly about Harvey and Bland as opposed to all those wonderfully weird, historical characters left in the margins 
 This was the 5th book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and the one I liked the least. I was intrigued by the subject of the book, as I have been with all of the subjects she has written about. But, this story did not measure up to my expectations at all.   This book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing, and could you/would you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time. One of the main characters is Cam MacDonald, who is the sheriff of Wheelock, Mass. Cam's cousin Jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to Cam, citing that he has just murdered his wife. Later, you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked Jamie to kill her. So naturally Jamie has to go on trial.   Well, a majority of the book turns out to be about Cam's adultery, which is annoying in and of itself. It seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok' since, as you discover, Cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it's expected of him. Plus, the person he has the affair with, he has known a day or so, which is ridiculous.   Interspersed throughout all of this, almost seeming like an afterthought, is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover.   I was very bored with this book, but continued to read it, thinking it was bound to pick up eventually. It never did. As it turned out, I ended up skimming the last 80 pages. If I were you, I'd pick another novel.   
 Feldman and Spratt advise lots of CEOs of large corporations as part of their work for PricewaterhouseCoopers (a mergerized mouthful if there ever was one), and those consulting habits show. The book is anecdotal and clever without being practical or useful, even if you're actually contemplating a merger. You will, however, learn the riddle of the five frogs on a log, which in the interest of saving time, we offer here: Five frogs are sitting on a log. Four decide to jump off. How many are left? Five. Because there's a difference between deciding and doing. "Execution," the authors tell us, "is always more difficult than it seems."  Here's the lesson: Smart advice is timeless. If you do want a quick take on making effective decisions, then consider the very short chapter "The Effective Decision" in Peter Drucker's Managing the Non-profit Corporation (HarperCollins, 1990). Drucker writes sharply about the evils of reaching consensus too quickly, the dangers of not doing your homework, and the fact that decision making always involves risk taking. He also observes that "far too many decisions remain pious intentions." Even more memorable than the frog story.  
 Is it just me, or do people not reliaze that this CD [...]. I mean come on! Actually, I was going to bootleg this CD, but at about the 12th song...I just said "Nah!" Now, your 12th edition of your series suffers from filler! Seriously, if I was to ask someone if they've heard of "Luv U Better", "Breathe", "I Should Be", or "Made You Look", they would be like WHAT?! You listen to techno still!!! No, I don't listen to techno. I listen to pop, hip-hop, r&b, and a bit of rock. Later on in life, you'll look on the back of this CD, and you will only know 2 or 3 of the songs on here. Really, Now 12 is an opposite of a TH complication. On Now 12, the crappy songs are at the beginning and the ending has all of the good tracks (there are only about 2 or 3). And still, some of the good songs are filler! The only songs on this entire complication I will remember are "Miss You", "Stole", "When I'm Gone", and maybe "Angel". The rest is either [...]  GO GET NOW 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and later 18+. NOW 12 [... 
 It started out as a murder mystery. I was pleasantly surprised. Then, it introduced the "affair" and that was it for me. The book became more about desperate housewives looking for love in all the wrong places. Please. Isn't this a little played out? I was not as impressed as everyone else was with this book. The book was overhyped. Sorry, but it's true. 
 Although the book is easy to read and there is some humor in it, it does not prepare you for the actual exam. The microsoft prepartion guide is actually the best out there to really prepare you for the exam.  This book is way to theoratical and does not go in depth for the actual solution(s) to specific cases.  All the real-life situations the authors been through and also describing them make the authors look a little bit arrogant. In some cases they try to hard to be funny, but let's put that aside because that is not why the book was written. 
 I vote for no more after this one.  First of all, the movie is edited horribly. There are numerous occurences where edits should have been TIGHTENED. The acting is so over the top it's ridiculous. Mary Griffith's (Aimee Graham) father is the stereotypical DEMON father.   We listen to these kids talk to the camera throughout the film and how they live to RAVE, so they can be ONE WITH THE MUSIC and how RAVEing and DRUGing is their life... and I could only ask... WHO CARES?  Then, the kids all arrive at the RAVE. Weehoo!! 45 minutes of BAH! BAH! BAH! BAH! BAH! music and Seizure inducing strobe effects. Kids so drugged up they spend most of the time sitting by the toilet. Punks living to beat up other kids. Punks who riot and create havoc for no reason. A drive by shooting that looked so fake and overdramatized.  Gets you all teary-eyed. Not because you have any emotional connection with any of the characters, but because you spent $1.50 renting the movie on discount day and spent 80 minutes of your life watching it... well... 72 minutes if you fast forward through the credits... 3:30 of BAH! BAH! BAH! for the opening credits... geez 
 A rambling, self-important, name-dropping, and pretentious work that I forced myself to finish.  The literary device of focusing on discussions with two fictional students during much of the book was annoying and an easy way to increase page count without requiring serious rigor. I have just started Galbraith's 'Money'; it seems much more robust, though admittedly of a slightly different focus 
 Great cd but there is a catch..........Watch the movie and listen to "A Heart Is A House For Love"..and "Nights Like This".Then listen to the cd.On the movie these songs are sung perfectly by Billy Valentine but on the cd they  changed "A heart is a House 4 Love,"  which on the cd was sung by The Dells.I love the Dells great job but.. There is no excuse for them changing "Nights Like This" after 7 ruined that song. Billy Valentine sung it with power and I bought the cd hoping it was him I was very let down. I am still looking 4 a copy of him singing it but no luck

 No secrets in this book....just some stories fron the 80's...don't waste your time or money buying this book 
 I bought this book a few months before a planned trip to Thailand hoping to learn more about their origins.  I did not get anything from this book.  I thought that it was terribly unreadable.  I have two major complaints: 1. It reads as though it is a grocery list.  Sentence after sentence is bogged down with unpronouncable names that don't add anything to the major concepts.  (I would love to give a quote as an example, but I seem to have lost the book; apparently I thought so little of it that I didn't even deem it worthy enough for the bookshelf) 2. There are not nearly enough maps, especially in the beginning chapters.  Wyatt is constantly refering to cities and places in their geographical relationships, but he doesn't provide any pictures of what he is trying to convey.  So you just end up with a jumble of names that are somewhere in Asia.  And with the constantly changing political boundaries in the early history, a few maps would seem obligatory, but there aren't any.    Overall, I was very, very disappointed with this book.  I couldn't even finish it because it was so dull and hard to read.  (Mr. Wyatt, not every history book needs to be like this.)  Don't waste your time or money.  Instead, go with a general south Asian history book; you'll pick up the important things and leave behind the excruciating details 
 I was facinated to start reading about the Atlanta Child Murders but was extrememly disappointed in the way this book was written.  Its really a shame that its so thick with various details that take you away from the subject at hand. I cannot think of a more poorly written book, and how unfortunate too since it is about such a heart-felt tragedy to everyone, regardless of race.  As intriguing as this subject is, if you wish to learn more about the despicable Atlanta Child Murders, you'll be wise to find it from another source 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 These authors are on the right track but they are more interested in impressing readers with their vocabulary than following through with some do-able solutions. I firmly believe that corporations need to catch up to what the customer really wants but this book meanders through a maze of technical and non-related issues which distract from the great theme it is about.  I trudged through the whole book waiting for an answer to the problem I could understand but there was absolutely no common sense I could grasp that would lead me to a satisfactory conclusion.  Felt like I was back in school again.  Ugh 
 I'm starting to appreciate John LeCarre novels more than I did when he was all over the bestseller list. This film version of one was acted well, but in 30 minutes there just wasn't anything to engage my interest. Not its characters and not its plot. A good cause worth building a story around, but not this story. I quit watching, so I guess I could be wrong, but I doubt it.  
 untrustworthy is the term that comes to mind to describe this piece of literature and its author.  There really isn't anything "human" about the "change " galpin advocates in reality.  In fact after hearing the man speak, one can only get the "whats in it for me" philosophy.  Secrecy, abandonment of ethics and morals comes to mind when   reviewing the work and the man.  Deeply disappointed 
 As a longtime visitor to Something Awful I have grown to enjoy Parson's   writing immensely. When purchasing this book I expected to read a light, humorous account of WWII inventions gone wrong. In reality, the book is a ponderous recitation of those inventions replete with plenty of mind-numbing technical details and absent of anything remotely resembling humor. Hopefully SA/Parson's next literary venture will help us forget this stinker.  
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out 
 This is garbage to say the least.Music for little geeks who can't get laid.This band couldn't play a lick of real music.Numetal is just plain RETARDED 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 It's quite interesting in that is shows what makes the people of this nation tick, by looking at their traditions and examining their ideologies. It addresses the breakdown of traditional communities and human interactions. But the conclusions this book comes to should be quite horrifying to any RATIONAL Joe. The tone of the book is that we are all social animals that live, interact.... and work together in a community based on responsibility to care for others. It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some "inherent responsibility" to others. The book's states that we will only become "human by accepting our essential poverty as a GIFT, and to share our material wealth with those in need."......this is the most anti-American book I've read which tries to fix the social climate in the most horrifying ways. This is SOCIALISM disguised as a Traditional American Way of Life 
 This book is a piece of useless .... Aliens from space? Where's the proof? This book is full of second hand accounts of this and that, but in the end they don't add up to squat. Overall I think Donald Keyhoe was a charlatan trying to make a quick buck. This book is only for the UFO faithful 
 This obsolete text has been forced on actuarial students for decades.  Time to get rid of it.  The book is grossly deficient in practical applications.  Yeah, it's called theory, but actuaries are supposed to apply the theories, not memorize them like so many abstract algebra concepts.  Buy the Schaum's Outline.  If you can find it, get the book from Butcher & Nesbitt that has been out of print. Completely superior. [...] Time for a change.  
 If books had a dressing contest, this one would surely take first place. It applies every imaginable gimmick for the sole purpose of impressing the reader. There are many pictures in it, all of which are sensational adolescent fantasy material, many filling a full page and sometimes in color. The text is broken up in various ways, with intervening boxes and sidebars in incosistent shapes and sizes, as if designed specifically to distract you. Its "techniques" are trademarked under the bombastic name "Emotioneering", and worst of all, the author makes a point of repeatedly flaunting his screen(game)writing prowess.  But what are these "Emotioneering" techniques? has freeman actually invented a set of technical rules which applies to drama? No, that would be Aristotle. If you're really interested in the rules of drama, that's whom you should read. What Freeman refers to as "Emotioneering" are nothing more than a pile of bad screenwrting practices you can pick up in any second rate screenwriting book - except for two differences; first, in this sorry book they are given mind-blowing names like "technique stacking" and "Emotionally Complex Moments and Situations Techniques", and second, the examples used are said to be taken "from games" instead of from films, but, of course, all of these "games" have been imagined by Freeman for the purpose of the book (which he expressly admits), because there IS no real world game that would serve his purpose - he is really talking about films.   But when it comes to films, Freeman seems to think the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about the best you can get. Ask any amateur screenwriter and they'll tell you that the one award these films honestly deserve is Worst Screenplay. The Lord of the Rings, like Freeman's book, is all spectacle and no content.  What kept me trudging through the morass of simpleton notions and overflowing filler text was the hope that, as a man who has some experience with writing for games, Freeman would have a few words to say about the intersection of stories with interactivity - the most alluring aspect of combining games with stories. Although he doesn't take up the subject directly, he does mention at some point that writing for games is complicated by the need to accommodate for the actions of the player. He says that he uses branching statements in his scripts for this, and that this is a very tough problem. Other than that, there are some minor points like how to allow the player to experience the events of your computerized screenplay in several different orders (which is made possible only by the ridicules simplicity of the story proposed as an example), but nothing which actually deals with letting a human have a meaningful interaction with a story.   To summarize, except for the pictures (if that's your cup of tea) I really can't see any reason to buy this book over any other random heap of text. If you want spectacle, you got it. If you want knowledge, you do yourself a favor and read three books: The Poetics by Aristotle, for the real "Emotioneering" techniques, Chris Crawford on Game Design, for an understanding of why the problem is not nearly as simple as Freeman pretends it to be, and Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling for the best solutions to the problem currently available. 
       I hated this book!  Or maybe I was just rooting for C.J. to get his stuff together in the third book and have Joe Pickett ready to fly for another twenty years.  It's what I expected anyhow.  Didn't happen.   	    The first Joe Pickett story seemed a little tall and convoluted, but the yarn was spun tightly and with dexterity and wit.  I couldn't put it down.  You knew that C.J. Box and Joe Pickett would be around for a long while.  The second book had me looking forward to more Joe Pickett yarns in spite of exploding cows.  An audience was building.  Word was getting around that C.J. Box could keep you interested.  It was time for Pickett to settle down a bit, ease off the fantastics, and start a long career.  Then he fell off the mountain.       WINTERKILL opens with a humiliating and extremely unlikely scene of a Forest Supervisor's "nervous breakdown" that contributes nothing substantial to the story.  From there, it traverses a litany of extremes.  Our humble, heroic game warden in remote Wyoming is forced down a gauntlet of sociopathology, psychopathology, political aberrations, weather extremes, bureaucratic obstruction and cover-up, and the killing of a carefully developed sympathetic character.  Then, incredibly, staight-arrow Joe Picket becomes complicit in a felony that will never be discovered.  	    C.J. Box is a clever, compelling writer, but I don't see how Joe Pickett will ever recover from this dark detour.    
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 We received this toy from my son's grandmother when he was three months old and he seemed very interested in it even though some of the functions were out of his reach or a little too hard for him to use.  I was a little worried about the strap design from the beginning but thought I was just being overly anxious.  Wrong.  Several times I noticed the straps slipping.  I figured it was just because I had them in the lowest notch so I moved them up one.  He could only reach the very bottom toys that way but he still enjoyed it.  This seemed to help for awhile but then he realized there were other things on the back of the toy and got curious and started pulling the toy out toward him.  This was okay until he lifted up on it at the same time.  It came right off the straps and hit him in the head.  Thank goodness it hit the mattress first and then fell over on him so that it was an indirect hit because this toy is HEAVY.  It weighs close to 3 pounds with the batteries in it and is hard plastic and that is quite a lot to fall on baby's head.  I have emailed Tiny Love regarding the problem but also wanted to let other parents know that this is a good floor toy but don't rely on the hanging straps 
 The book is basic, and not badly written; friendly and clear advice and instruction for the would-be surfer, but it's a slim volume-and here's the rub (and the reason for only 2 stars):  the binding of this trade paperback was the worst I've seen in quite a while-it fell apart after one read-through, with whole handfuls of the sewn-in pages cascading to the floor.  Most defintely NOT what you'd want in any how-to book 
 watch videos and go to the movies together, become an expert on the consumer, do quantitative research, seperate your brand from the competitor...  these are some of the 52 ideas.  lots of fluff, no guts.  i was looking for more detail.  how should i conduct research?  how have other companies done it?  what worked in the past?  what didnt?    this is a book for an executive of a large corporation who has lost touch.  not for someone who wants to start a business.. 
 Mostly notorious when it was released in 1987 for featuring wholesome sitcom star Lisa Bonet in a sex scene with some nudity (and thereby supposedly offending Bill Cosby), ANGEL HEART has acquired quite a reputation as a cult film since then, some of which is quite deserved for its astonishingly beautiful cinematography and editing. Some of the compositions (particularly two repeated overhead shots of stairwells, one in Harlem and one in New Orleans) are among the most stunning of any film from the 1980s, and the set decorations are similarly out of this world. Though there's also Mickey Rourke's beautiful youthful face (pre-boxing injuries) to be gazed upon, there's really little else to recommend this movie, even if its big twist at the end catches you unawares: the film is basically constructed as a rebus, with various visual (seeming) non sequiturs keying you in to the big narrative surprise at the end. But the big horror moments have almost no suspense built into them, and the acting is fairly shoddy: O'Rourke gives a real hambone performance, and Bonet must be the dullest voodoo priestess ever to appear onscreen. You know what you're in for when the characters have names like "Harry Angel," "Louis Cyphre," "Toots Sweet," and "Epiphany Proudfoot"; even the beautiful look of the film can't overcome the shallowness and dispiritedness of the script 
 Don't waste your money on this book! It does have a few useful bits of  info but if you think you could build a gun using this book, think again.  The black and white photos were so over exposed that you can't make out any  detail, the drawings were so faint that half of them couldn't be seen and  nearly all of them didn't have any dimensions.I'd suggest Gerard Metrals  book "A Do-it Yourself Submachine Gun" if you have access to  machining equipment.It's packed full of prints.Also try Bill Holmes later  volumes 3, 4, and 5. He did a much better job on those 
 I was disappointed in this book when I received it.  I was looking for ways to make my H.S. History class more exciting, but I found that most of the suggestions in the book were geared more for the elementary school  levels.  The format of the book is set-up more like a comic book than an  academic book and is filled with cartoon drawings and funny sayings.   Although it was fun to read, I really did not feel that I acquired any  useful knowledge from it 
 Had the printer for just over a year with light use.  I started getting numerous error messages, then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or I couldn't get it to print at all.  Spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense - (was told to push buttons my printer doesn't have, and when I told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to re-set the printer, she replied "great, that means it worked.")  Was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for $290, the same price I paid for it a year ago, or upgrading to a C6180 for $300, which is $20 more than the current price on Amazon.  This product has been a waste of time, money and energy 
 I received this book for Christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.  The story itself isn't bad, but I found the writing styles simplistic and like I said before, annoying.  The four main characters have no chemistry.  They are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.  The same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  Here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, "I sure wish I knew."    Hey look, I can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  Boy, I sure wish I knew.  Hey!  Look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  I sure wish I knew.  Maybe I expected too much of this book since I don't read sci-fi only.   But as I said, I could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  What a shame = 
 I received this as a gift.  I was thrilled with the results the first few times I used it.  Then the little red light went out while I was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  I only got to use it three times 
 THE MUSIC IS ALL RIGHT, BUT THE RECORD MUST BE FLAWED.WHOEVER RECORDED THIS RECORD MUST NOT HAVE PLAYED IT OR THEY DID NOT CARE WHAT THE BUYER GOT. I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING RECORDS OF ALL KINDS FOR 65 YEARS. PARTS OF THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD AND PARTS ARE HORRIBLE.I WANT TO RETURN THIS ONE AND RUSS MORGAN,WHICH ALSO HAS REAL BAD SPOTS. IF YOU HAVE BETTER RECORDINGS OF THESE CDS I WOULD LIKE TO SWAP.I AM LOOKING FOR MANY BANDS AND SINGERS FROM THE THIRTYS AND FORTIES. THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE SPACE TO EXPRESS MY SELF. I DO NOT MIND PAYING WHAT IT TAKES TO BUY WHAT I WANT, BUT I DO LIKE TO RECEIVE FIRST CLASS MERCHANDISE.    JACK FINNEY 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 The acting and writing is atrocious and I was dumbfounded that some people would rate this movie highly.  The little brother's spoken parts are so British it is laughable and the hero, his brother, has a Scandanavian accent. The main character is no actor and it is embarrassing at times listening to him and watching him. The whole movie is so contrived and corny I gave up watching it more than halfway through. Just because it is based on a real character doesn't make it a good, or watchable movie 
 My favorite series ever, but that's been covered elsewhere.  I love owning the complete set, seasons 1 through 7...however...the show isn't a miracle cure for the hard of hearing.  I suppose the extra 5 cents per unit to add English subtitles put y'all over budget top.  It must be nice to have a captive audience, you should only have the opportunity to learn the lesson of LAST TUESDAY!! 
 By far the dumbest, most confusing novel I have ever read. We read it in our Contemporary fiction class in College and we are now trying to get them to change the curriculm so we are never forced to read such rubbish again 
 Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.  I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.  It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.  Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did) 
 I thought I'd like this CD better. The music is alright, but with all the enchanting and melodic sounds of Irish heritage, I was slightly disappointed that the songs they chose weren't that great. I've been happier playing Enya  
 This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and lewss fluff, if you will. 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I really wanted to love this book...I still have my original copy of the 1964 Yearbook, and as far as I'm concerned, it's still the definitive edition.  With the announcement of this HARDCOVER edition, I was hoping the publisher would take the opportunity to make this parody look like a REAL yearbook.  One of the things the NL was great at doing was an Exact Parody of the thing they were satirizing.  In the original edition the paper utilized different stocks for different functions. Also, the book could be placed upside down and backwards on a surface and aside from the paperback binding, it looked like a vintage yearbook.  This version is loud, garish, the buttcheecks have been covered up, and the logo is wrong...Perhaps I'm a purist, but the design of this book is just all wrong.  It should have been released in a dust jacket that could be removed, with a real looking binding of a yearbook underneath.  Also, the printing inside the book looks like it was printed from an old copy of the yearbook magazine, instead of the original stats or negatives...Yes, the comedy is still great, but the design is greatly flawed...I'd only recommend getting it if you have to have it...Otherwise, hold out for an original copy, it just feels better 
 My daughter got this for Christmas and it only says, "Know what goes good with everything? Ripped Pants!"  Then he sings, "You won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants." and then says, "This is so embarrassing!"  My daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we can't get it to do it again. It seems like it's stuck in the "demo" mode and we can't figure out how to make it work.    I called Fisher Price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time,  Probably due to the fact that every parent who's child recieved this toy is calling to complain. 
 I had high hopes for this movie. Alas it was a wasted sentiment.  It started off very s-l-o-w. It had a great premise. An aging Don Juan gets a mysterious letter saying he has a son....and he may be looking for him. So off he goes on a journey.  But...can Murray possibly have more of a complete stone face? His complete and total lack of any emotion was appalling. I kept waiting for this charming, charismatic man who seduced woman after woman to pop out. Nope. I thought this was a comedy/drama? No comedy. No drama.  In fact everyone in this movie acted with such stilted restraint in this movie it was painful. Very unrealistic. People do not act this way....  The conversations and time spent with each woman he once had a "relationship" or one night stand (we never know as they never once talk about anything much) are boring and again unrealistic. If someone I had not seen in 20 years showed up, I think I might have a couple questions, some animation. Either it be anger or surprise.   One other thing about this movie. It feels claustrophobic. Tight. Constricted. Scenes drag on forever. Shot of him sitting on his couch staring 2 min. Shots of him driving down the road (many of those) with horrendous jazz playing...dragging on for a minute. Just constant boring listless shots. It got to the point if I knew what he was going to do next- say go over to his neighbors house- I would fast forward...knowing it would be a boring drawn out walk over there. I never FF through movies, this one demanded it.   This really is a horrible movie. I wasted over 2 hours on this only to have the end....be a total dud. Bleck. 
 I agree with the guys who gave this movie one or 2 stars.   Its a decent movie, but its just one thing that makes me sick to my damn stomach; and thats christopher lambert. For one his terrible acting in this movie and the fact that he played Raiden in the Mortal Kombat movies. WTF, is what I have to say.    Why does hollywood have to use a white man to always be the hero in most movies dedicated to asian or martial arts movies. I mean come on, Christopher Lambert, with his stupid scratchy voice. If your gonna use a american\white actor, at least use Micheal Dudikof (ok, im joking about that one). But seriously, there are so many movies about ninjas that use a white actor to be the main guy who becomes ninja; i.e. American ninja parts 1-2-3-4etc, hunted, Batman Begins, and whose the guy who played in "blind Fury". haha, what was that about? I bet when the japanese watch our movies they laugh and then puke in disgust. I do.  But there is one good movie out there that does incorporate a white man in a japananese sword figting genre, and thats "the Last Samurai."  At least they had a good reason why capt. Algren (played by Tom Cruise) joined and became a Samurai. He was already a soldier in the American army, so he knew about battle strategies, he hated his commander and the way the North was going about killing innocent women and children. And he trained as a Samurai for about 9 months to a year I think in the movie; unlike lambert who trained for 3 days trying to cut a apple in half. I used to be in the army as an infantry man, and if it were me back in those days, Id be a samurai in a heart beat if I could. only if we were still fighting samurais, I mean those warriors had class, not like these damn terrorist's were fighting today.    So I give this movie 2 stars, one: because it one of the most recent serious ninja movies, and two: because Takeda is one bad ass mother f****r. The rest just sucks 
 I have ordered several Le Creuset items, and have always been happy with my purchase.  Not so with this teapot.  I cannot use it on my stovetop, according to the warnings posted on the packaging.  
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I'm sure this product is fine. But don't order it through Amazon, through Ritz Camera. They just cancelled my order without warning, having listed that the bag was available. Freaking idiots 
 Like W.D. I felt that the novel was lengthy with characters that simply cluttered the landscape. Tragedy after tragedy unfolds: a kidnapping of an ellitist; a run on a bank; a near-stock market crash; Hong Kong's world-famous floating restaurant catches fire, burns, and sinks; a mud-slide that destroys a prominent hotel; a chinese-communist espionage plot; a soviet espionage plot; secret-agents, double-agents, triple agents (do I need to go on)! All of this occurring within ten days, but the reader loses sense of the time since the book is so time consuming. I was fascinated with Clavell's Taipan and was further interested in the exploits of the Struan family. This was a disppointment! Dunross, the present Taipan, moves through novel with a killer business instinct and brief instances of compassion and humanity. Why does he do it? He is trying to live up to a legacy. That's it. In one sentence that is as deep as Dunross goes. The novel Taipan was so different in development of its characters. Dunross'one-sentence purpose for living, when contrasted with Dirk Struan's vision of the Noble House helping China become a world power was completely lacking. Clavell's earlier work was very insightful about China especially in its potential influence. However, the parade of characters in Noble House is similar to a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant: plenty of food, but lacking in authentic taste. Overall the work was very tiring and uninspiring. Nothing noble about it at all.   
 Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!) 
 It's official; Gary Almy has been sentenced to seven years in prison for sexually abusing boys.  Almy was a leading proponent of rigid "bible-only" counseling (no integration of social sciences)and was a board member of the International Association of Biblical Counselors (IABC).  Chicago Tribune Psychiatrist gets 7 years for sexually abusing boys Published June 8, 2005  LAKE COUNTY -- A Long Grove psychiatrist was sentenced Tuesday to 7 years in prison for sexually molesting three boys at a school he operated in his home.  Gary Almy, 61, of the 3100 block of Old McHenry Road pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse on Tuesday as part of a plea bargain before Lake County Circuit Judge Victoria Rossetti.  Almy admitted molesting a boy, 14, from Indiana in 2003. The boy attended Almy's Truth in Action Academy.  He also admitted fondling a 14-year-old boy in the summer of 2003 and a 10-year-old boy in 2000, both at his house.  Almy was a staff psychiatrist at LYDIA Home Association, a faith-based child-welfare agency in Chicago, but resigned in February. He also is a former chief of staff at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Chicago. 
 it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea 
 What were they thinking?!  There are actually scenes DELETED from the original theatrical release!!  The extended edition is an "abomination" if there ever were one.    Furthermore, I discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product.  Seek out the original release because I believe the "original" release included in this set is not of the same quality.  David Lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition 
 If you aren't familiar with women's studies and feminism, you really should read this book, it's a great overview and if you haven't studied this material before you will find her research very interesting.   However, anyone who has taken a college level women's studies course will be bored to tears by this book. She provides a summary of the accepted cannon of feminist works and authors (all of which i had previously encountered). Her actual journey of awakening, due to her former religious views, is interesting enough, but didn't have me glued 
 This movie is demented. It's only a tiny bit above something sold in an adult video store, as it is basically just one sex scene after another. If you hate other people, and want to have an excuse to distrust everyone you meet, watch this diseased film 
 I have the Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions book by Proulx and from looking at the Table of Contents of this "new" book on line at Amazon, I believe that many if not all of the projects in both books are identical or very similar.  Most of the photos in the Table of Contents of Best of Danny Prolux Storage & Shelving are the same as the ones in Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions.  I'm sorry that Mr. Proulx finds it necessary to reissue an old book under a slightly different title.  I for one will buy a different book 
 Although I agree that sex education needs to start at home. I think this book pushes to much information for children! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone 
 People - you are both wrong in what you are doing. Pro and Anti-muslim arguments really don't belong here. Information regarding the translation and accuracy maybe, but the Quran is not on trial here. Focus on the product - not it's teaching.  Frankly, it would be nice for people to know that there are no "original manuscripts" for translation and that the Quran is thousands of years newer than the Bible. I think it is interesting that there are contradicting passages that are not a contradiction because Allah can change his mind - but that isn't really a review of this particular book 
 Downing is an excellent writer making postmodern philosophy very accessible.  Another plus is she has interacted with the primary sources.  Too many evangelicals just read critiques by other evangelicals.  Downing has spent some time with postmodern writers.  Much of the book was helpful.  She shows that postmodernisms exposing of the flaws of modernism has served our faith.  This is very true in many ways, but Downing goes too far the other way.  She leans toward inclusivism, which is a very tempting thing to do in today's postmodern culture in order to not offend, and remain respectable.  The problem is the biblical worldview will not allow it.  Christians must build their worldview from Scripture, as unpopluar as this may be.  You just can't mix worldviews and remain faithful to both.  I would reccomend Veith's 'Postmodern Times' then this one 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 "Col Mike Martin" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........  The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban.  Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.  Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one. 
 Great Hardware but plagued with extremely poor and buggy firmware and clueless customer service.  Serious incompatibility and unreliability issues make this device unsuitable for backup or safe storage of data.  
 The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.  Because the camera was shipped in November 2005, Sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111.  Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future 
 I tried to read and love this book several times , and I have a degree from Columbia in Literature and I read a lot of Fantasy but I just can't get into this book! Nothing HAPPENS! It just goes on and on and I can't like or identify with or wish to live vicariously through anybody! Isn't that what the Fantasy genre is supposed to be about 
 the "in death" series just seems to be getting worse and worse. THe story lines are all basically the same and the id of the killer is known by the second chapter. THe characters are not developing at all and time is going by way to slowly, Mavis has been pregnant for what, 2 or 3 yrs now and this is only their 2nd christmas together. I used to get these in hardcover and then I started to wait for paperback, now I just wait till it gets to my local library 
 It is NOT worth the money. It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable 
 I was disappointed in this CD.  The choice of songs is okay, but his voice leaves a little to be desired.  Not something I would recommend to true Smokey Robinson/Miracles fans.  Some of the songs are almost painful to listen to.  I am sorry I wasted my money. 
 If you're looking for an instruction book on LF Photography, then this is NOT the book.    Jack Dykinga's highly acclaimed talent as a photographer does not translate into this book.  As other reviewers have commented, the book falls far short on technical merit.  
 Instead of being titled "property and freedom," it should be titled "property and power." Pipes was a prominent old cold-war apologist for American capitalism, and you can tell that he is still trapped in his little world of false-dichotomy.   Pipes overall argument is contrived, and with the exception of his knowledge of Russian history, superficial. Most of his time is spent criticizing the Stalinist Soviet Union, while at the same time lacking any thoughtful rebuttal to Marx's critique of capitalism.  His title claim, that freedom cannot exist without private property, is weak philosophically and logically. He has poor insight into the nature of freedom and presonal responsibilty. He would really benefit by reading some Sartre or Nietzche, before trying to describe his own made up idea freedom. His attempts to link economic thought with philosophy and history fail miserably. He barely exposes the actual writings of Marx. This is incredibly unfortuante since most "real-world" capitalists, such as wealthy Wall street brokers, know that Marx understood capitalism better than any of its supporters. His philosophical support is all anecdotal with no real thoughtful analysis. His historical summary, although detailed with Russia, leaves much to be desired. He fails to discuss slavery, prostitution, or even slumlords, all which flourish under American capitalism.   Although some might find his credentials enough to accept his flimsy argument, I for one was greatly disappointed. I realize that property is linked to power, but freedom is something completely different.   I'm sure many right-wing folks will look past all of this flaws in this books and embrace it. I'm sure the paternalistic allure of an established Harvard professor will cause some to avoid challenging the views in his book.    But I'm not trying to convince those people. Look past the credentials, the excessive use of footnotes to appear more "academic" ( a clear sign of a writer who is insecure of his own beliefs!), and the comfort of someone who agrees with your agenda, and you will discover shallow puerile nonsense 
 I can say that it is a singular waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and buy a book of successful essays instea 
 We were looking for scientific, comprehensive information about fertility and conception.  We found this book to be vague and general, which is OK if you need some background on general infertility or fertility issues.  If you want a much more specific "how-to" on identifying fertile days, knowledge of fertility signs, and how to make detailed charts that will be useful for you and your doctor, then we very strongly recommend Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" instead.  
 I've had this book for awhile and I've noticed that some of the drawings, especially the fashion illustrations look rather unprofessional.  There are drawings, renderings, that you would never see in fashion world.   Some of the drawings look like they are fine art life drawings; others look very much like student work, some look just badly drawn and should not be shown as explemary work for those who wish to learn.  I think that they are better books out there and this is not one of them.  
 Not a good read.  Have not read any other Kellerman but was not bothered by the absence of character development others have complained of.  I could not stand, however, his decision to focus on the detail of certain events.  One example, why dedicate so many plodding pages to a conversation with security guards at the end which contributed absolutely nothing to the resolution?  There are other instances.  Thankfully I picked this one up on the bargain table 
 The book is poorly written, which makes it difficult to read and understand.  There are very few examples.  The end of each chapter has a 10 question quiz, but there are no answers included.  The practices they teach in the Prospecting section are questionable 
 This protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end, but it has a horrible taste and texture.  The closest thing I can relate it to is chocolate-burned egg tasting boogers.  I would not purchase this product again.  I would, however, purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad 
 I used to enjoyed Discover, but the past several months of their radicals changes, got me to think a real dumbing down.Once in awhile, they would put together a good article - but not constantly.How can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.There are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.Discover's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube. Thank goodness Scientific American, Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, Science News havent fallen down.I am not renewing my subscription unless Discover 'rediscovers' itself.How dumb Americans are! 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
       LEARN-TO-DRAW:  UNTHINKING PERSONS APPLY HERE!  Edwards seems intent on obtaining dominance in the field of "How To Draw"  books written by those who cannot  teach,   employing a fashionable Madison Avenue advertising approach to Drawing-On-The-Cash-In-Your-Wallet.        Edwards seems to falsely presume that Michaelangelo,  Raphael,  Leonardo Da Vinci and other Renaissance Masters  all drew upon   knowledge regarding the RIGHT-SIDE of their brain,  or ZEN,  or even YOGA.  It's a nonsense proposition,  unsupported by fact.  Neither were such "masters" of drawing,  interested in selling HOW-TO-DRAW books.      One could examine infinitely the theme of an "Artist Within," a creative self within, or even a Divine Spark within. I myself endorse SPIRITUALITY with whole-hearted enthusiasm. The problem is, it just doesn't matter whether the artist is within/without, internal/external, left-brain/right brain, or just plain WRONG-HEADED;  because it amounts to nothing more than coy marketing where Betty Edwards is concerned.      Betty Edwards engages in gross self-promotion,  prevailing upon public sentiment to hold forth as art expert, Zen Buddhist, scientist, college professor,  and New Age mystic guru.      Authors like Edwards are using two prominent FALLACIES,  to lead readers on with promises of artistic empowerment:  (1)  The WHOLENESS or WELLNESS FALLACY:  which suggests that if  I am HEALED,  or WHOLE (in a psychological sense)   I will   be powerful,  and produce powerful art.   (2)  The KNOW-IT-ALL FALLACY:   which suggests that if I KNOW EVERYTHING,  such as is suggested by  invocations of QUANTUM THEORY,  or reading quotes from scientists, writers,  poets, philosophers  and  adopting Eastern Religions such as Yoga and Zen (on a very superficial level)  I will embrace a THEORY-OF-EVERYTHING, and as a consequence, I will be powerful,  and produce powerful art.         Edwards twists and bends all knowledge into a gooey mass of  rhetorical  gibberish.  Edwards cannot discern the difference between "WITHIN"  or "THE RIGHT  SIDE OF THE BRAIN".  By any stretch of definition,  they cannot be the SAME THING at the SAME  TIME.          The implication is clear;  Edwards believes art is conditional upon maintaining an intellectual act, in short, a KNOW-IT-ALL act,  inclusive of  Zen Buddhism,  New Age Cosmology,   Nuclear Physics,  Evolutionary Theory, Neurology,  and Philosophy. [Just like Gary Zukav];   or,  alternatively,  it is a WELLNESS act,  suggesting that we adopt a qasi-religious philosophy,  identifing with a HIGHER SELF that is WITHIN. Whereas that latter statement sounds profoundly true,   there is a problem.   How can you both tell people that they are "Drawing on the artist within"   and also tell them that the "artist" [HIGHER SELF]  is  "on the right side of the brain"?   This is where Edward's  ideas come into clear contradiction.           It is clear that those who recommend Edward's  books,   do not evidence  a predominance of  Left-Brain analytical functioning,  with objective analysis.  These are not "great thinkers" and yet Edwards claims require deep analysis.  She is very wordy and heavy on text and ideology.  It is virtually impossible to credit those who affirm Edward's  theories,  with an ability to use RIGHT-BRAIN functioning to  visualize the OBVERSE/NEGATIVE SPACE,  and at the same time actively use LEFT-BRAIN  ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONING to analyze or comprehend Edward's outer-galactic star cluster of  disconnected theories.  Go figure!         Morever,  Edwards cannot distinguish between  the fundamentally contradictory  reasoning inherent to METAPHYSICAL REALISM [the Platonic WORDS-ARE-REAL] as opposed to:   METAPHYSICAL NOMINALISM [WORDS-ARE-NOTHING]; but Edwards is just preaching to the choir anyway. Who's kidding who?   This is an overly complex approach, but worse,  it is an absolute contradiction in logic;   but Edwards manages to both affirm  the rational,  the scientific,  and the non-rational and metaphysical at the same time. Her scientists are "magicians" and perform  "magic".  Her magicians are scientists who expound profound  core theories of physics.    Knowledge of both or either of these make you an artist?          Betty Edwards,  by introducing personal metaphysics into teaching drawing,  is essentially dictating to students, that they must accept the philosophical and pseudo-scientific ideology, before they can even begin to learn to draw.         Betty Edwards teaches that THERE ARE THOSE WHO CANNOT DRAW-BUT CAN DRAW-  CANNOT DRAW -- BUT CAN DRAW  -- CANNOT DRAW-- BUT CAN DRAW   ....and having taught this fundamental contradiction in reason,   has found an army of ideological "lemmings" who repeat the propaganda slogan as though it were a fundamental, logical, rational,  medical diagnosis,   a  philosophical,  and psychological  fact.    It's analogous to somebody WALKING down the street with you, and saying,  "I CANNOT WALK!  I CANNOT WALK!" and of course,  you point out to them,  "Hey,  but you ARE walking!" and they respond,  "No, you do not understand,  I CANNOT WALK!"  Whereupon you insist,  "But you ARE walking!  So you CAN walk, after all!"   and they respond,     "Yes,  of course I'm walking,  but only because Betty Edwards taught me how to walk within the NEGATIVE SPACE around my feet!That's why!"             It reminds one of the PARADOX OF EPIMENIDES:       "All Greeks are Liars! --by Epimenides, a Greek     Edwards has a following,  that much is evident;  but merely because a mass of people claim  a thing is so,  does not make it so. [The Populist  Fallacy ]  The contradictions and paradoxes do not sum up to simple truth.       An analogy might be like declaring:  EVERYTHING IS TRUE.  IF ANYONE SAYS OTHERWISE,  IT'S FALSE!     Edwards pulls this off very neatly. You are to both DRAW ON THE ARTIST 'WITHIN'   and also   DRAW ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN,  at the same time.  Both are true, and nothing is false.  Scientists are metaphysicians,  and metaphysicians are scientists.     The ultimate irrationality however,  is the suggestion that those who "draw",  by Edward's miraculous methodologies,  are  "artists".  If you subscribe to Edward's theory,  you are drawing on the "ARTIST WITHIN".  Isn't that nice? So,  if everyone is an "ARTIST"  by virtue of the existence of the "ARTIST WITHIN"   how do we distinguish  between someone who IS and IS-NOT   an artist?   You cannot. That is the marvelous slight-of-hand that Edwards is pulling off on the general public.  Both or either YOU and BETTY EDWARDS and MICHAELANGELO.....are ONE,  and not only,  but you are "in ZEN" too!    It's a laughable proposition at best.             
 Was a lot smaller than I expected. My daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit. Because she couldn't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick 
 Jenna Marshall is a high school chemistry teacher.  Steven Hatcher is a cop whose son is suddenly failing Jenna's class.  They are instantly attracted as he literally runs into her in the hall and is intrigued because she wears garters (to school???).  She's flunked the star football player, Rudy Lutz, and now someone is vandalizing her car, classroom, etc.  He's on the hunt for a serial killer who kidnaps cheerleaders, shaves their heads and mutilates them while at the same time trying to raise 3 boys.    Funny how their problems seem to have a way of coinciding.  After loving Rose's first book, I'm Watching You, I was very disappointed in Have You Seen Her?.  The plot has holes you can drive a Mac truck through.  Such as, given the killer's modus operandi, why would he instead break into Jenna's apartment and try to stab her?  And why, after Steven's declared that Jenna needs round the clock protection, does he just leave her sitting alone for hours at the school where her tormentors knowingly lurk because he can't get around to picking her up or sending someone else to get her?  And how can they daily vandalize her classroom in a locked school?  And ... unfortunately, there's way too many to list them all.  I'm Watching You may have had similar plot flaws but if so I didn't notice because I loved the interaction between the characters.  Not so here.  Jenna was fine, but Steven was a whiny whimp, with the romance constantly interrupted by something stupid that he does.  I haven't given up yet on Rose; I'll try her next one with the hope that it's much more like her first book and much much better than this one 
 I have used Taxcut and TurboTax on and off for years.  TurboTax tends to have less problems.  This year Taxcut was incredibly difficult.  First it would not properly import the data from DeductionPro.  Then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information.  Finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data.  Also,  when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number.  Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn.  I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone.  Because of these delays I have still not finished with the state return.  I don't know if I will buy this product again.  
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 I have been purchasing the Vanity Fair My Satin Fantasy bras for years and YEARS!!!!   BUT, I have become very very disappointed.  I just bought 4 and ordered the free ones on the special offer "buy 2, get one free".  Now I have 6 bras that are practicallly worn out after the first wearing!  The little laces wore through nearly all the way, the stay poked out on the first wearing.  I carefully hand wash them and hang to dry, no wringing.    I think the manufacturer is trying to save money by eliminating the little plastic caps on the ends of the stays.  I have a huge scratch where the stay ripped my skin.  The style changed and the quality as well.  I would like an explanation and would like money back!   I am so sad that a great product is now less than mediocre 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 If Cass Pennant came up against 500 people with just him and his mate the 500 people would come off worse,well that's if your to believe this book.It's a good read but he does exagerate and it should be in the fiction section.Those Cockney's do like to bend the truth 
 Here's a great example of an album that has not withstood the test of time, indeed, it's odd to recall how controversial it was when it was released.  Herbie Hancock is a monster by any measure, a prodigy who emerged as a major player in the Miles Davis quintet and solo works like the unforgettable Maiden Voyage.  He seemed to enjoy controversy; with Davis he was on the frontier, flirting with something exciting, neither fish nor fowl, neither jazz nor rock, ultimately dubbed fusion.  Years later, he tried to kluge fusion and funk with Head Hunters.  The album was fabulously successful; the sales numbers were unthinkable for a jazz album.  But then, it wasn't even close to being a jazz album, and not a fusion album either.  As a funk album it barely has enough energy to get out of bed, if it played the Apollo Theater it would get boo-ed off the stage in under three minutes.  What it does have is inoffensive catchiness; Hancock decided to strike up the bland.  These days, the music one hears while waiting to visit the dentist is more interesting than this.     
 This is a continuation of The Mind of The Soul by this pair and The Seat of the Soul by Mr. Zukav.  He has published three others about the soul, yet he is not a psychologist or specialist in this field.  This is an extremely simplified textbook which found its way to the library sale.  The bold-faced "highlighted" parts throughout are distracting.  From some of the diagams, these ideas:  "The early antidote for painful emotions is Love and Trust" (combined), "You continually encounter what your soul wants you to encounter.  When you resist your encounters, you resist the purpose of your life, the beneficience of the Universe, non-physical assistance.  That resistance is your pain," and "Stress is your indication you are resisting your experience in the present moment.  When you resist your emotions, you create stress."  Your emotions are the force field of your soul.  Each emotion is a message for you, a signal from your soul.  When you are aware of everything you are feeling all the time (emotional awareness), you are in continual communication with your soul.  This book is a lot of wishful thinking.  They are a good-looking couple, but hardly qualified to influence educated persons about how to handle emotions or reach deep down to find one's soul.  That is a spiritual thing 
 I was so impressed by the rave reviews that I couldn't wait to buy this book.  It was one of my biggest disappointments! The "recipe" for broiled veal chops is salt and pepper the veal and broil it. Likewise, the recipes for broiled pork chops and broiled steak are salt and pepper and broil. That's a recipe? The book is very heavy on veal and uses can after can of San Marzano Italian plum tomatoes which might be readily available in big cities but not in my world. Frankly - there was nothing here that seemed unusual or special.  Save your money to actually fly to NYC to visit the restaurant.  Aapparently being "exclusive" makes up for simplisitic non-recipe recipes 
 My 1 year old son loves the Little Einsteins show, so I bought him this book.  I am sorely disappointed with the book, and my son doesn't care for it.  It's a complete ripoff from the Farmer Annie's Garden episode, and doesn't add anything to it.  There is only one lift flap per page.  The book could use more substance 
 What can I say about the truly inspired film "Havoc" that hasn't been said before?  Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award winning documentarian, taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture--sounds like a recipe for success!  Add a talented cast of appealing up-and-coming actors given really meaty roles--awesome!  Not so much...  "Havoc" is, unfortuanately, an unmitigated disaster.  You won't believe your eyes.  The kids, the gangs, the streets of L.A.--everything just rings so false.  The last time I saw so many posers "playing" street toughs was at my Junior High auditions for "Grease".  And I think we could have taken these kids.  A lot has been made about the "shocking" sexual content of the film.  Anyone "shocked" by this movie probably doesn't see very many movies.  Anne Hathaway does appear naked, which seems to be a selling point, but she and everyone else deserves better.  I'd actually have rated the movie about a 4--because it's a campy mess!!!  If someone had realized that this was a B-level exploitation flick, and sold it as such--I'd have bought into it.  No, though.  This is a "serious movie" and "important" document of our time.  Sadly, on that scale, these kids need to go back to school because they failed 
 I don't know quite what to say about this book... This is the second book in the trilogy and while I found the first book to be a bit hokey, at least it was somewhat different and readable. This book is all over the place. There are so many holes in the story that it left me feeling frustrated. Also, the author has an annoying habit of just repeating the same facts ad nauseam instead of developing the storyline and working on character development.  I like this author (or at least did) and I was looking forward to something new from her. Unfortunately, this book felt like a complete a waste of time 
 This book was full of stories of women who struggled with common friendship troubles and hints about how to help yourself if you are in a position in which you don't have enough friends due to a life change.  However, if you are reading it because you don't have very many friends and hope to learn ways to change that, a few hints aren't really going to be too terribly helpful.   If you recently became a stay at home mom and hadn't thought of trying to meet your neighbors, this book will be useful to you.  If you don't have friends because you are shy, don't know how to be friends with women, or one of the other multitudes of reasons why you might not have enough friends, this book won't help much, but you will be armed with new reasons why it is bad to not have friends.  
 Just as another anthropologist with a Ph.D. perpetrated a hoax by raping the soul of a culture, while appealing to the drug culture, Wesselman offers a series of Castaneda re-treads, appealing to the masturbatory fantasies of spiritual eunuchs.  Summoning every tired new age cliché from the Art Bell lexicon, Wesselman is to mysticism what Jackie Collins is to quantum physics 
 Although a pretty kettle, and with a wide enough base to support a full flame on commercial range such as Viking or Wolf, the inside became pitted and rusted within months. When I inquired from LeCreuset, they explained that it was not an isolated incident, but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item. Unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months, stay away from this on 
 Don't waste your money on this tripe. It's completely biased with inaccurate information from an untrustworthy radical. The premise is simple: America, the evil empire. Totally wrong. For one thing, an empire has to have colonies. America has none. Evil? It was these proxy wars that kept a nuclear war from happening. To take Blum seriously, one has to believe, as he does, that the Soviet Union was never a threat and that they weren't behind the majority of Third World revolutions. In what universe? More specifically: This is a man who condemns American and British efforts to stop the Bolsheviks. Without the Soviet Union, there would have not been a need for any of these interventions. Iran: Blum's version-the US, to secure cheap oil, cooked up the communism angle and overturned a democracy into a dictatorship of great brutality. WRONG! Mossedegh WAS a communist who was NOT elected. He was appointed, then fired by the Shah, and when he refused to leave office, the CIA helped put the Shah back on his rightful throne, where he proceeded to modernize Iran and most likely would have led it to democracy. Brutal? Only to those who actively tried to overthrow him, most of whom were agents of Russia. Even the Ayatollah was a Soviet stooge until he backstabbed them in '83. Guatemala: Evil US, to protect a fruit corporation, overthrows a moderate leader. WRONG! Arbenz was a communist. The coup began in his country, not the US, when he began receiving weapons from the Soviet Union. After he was deposed, he took refuge in the Soviet Union too. As for the dictatorship that followed, it's going to take a while to undo centuries of conditioning. Cuba: Evil US bullies a good-natured reformer into joining the Soviets. WRONG! Castro hated the US before he was ever in power. He and Che Guevara executed hundreds of men within the first few months, taking what was a vibrant economy and ruining it, even with $130 billion in Soviet subsidies. The Bay of Pigs was totally comprised of Cubans, all of whom were helping a home-grown revolt in Cuba: the Escambray Rebellion, which Castro stopped by having Russian officers enforce a brutal relocation program. To say nothing of the terror plots, use of poison gases, exectutions without trial, and the fact that everyone on the island is trying to get here! And very few of them are landowners. Castro, according to RJ Rummel, has killed more people than Pinochet, the "death squads" and Somoza combined and multiplied. Any assassination attempt on him would truly be justifiable homicide. Vietnam: Hey, I won't argue that our soldiers acted brutally, but it was nothing compared to the VC's deliberate reign of terror and genocide against the degar tribes. The VC were not South Vietnamese nationalists. They were agents of North Vietnam whose job was to weaken South Vietnam for a Northern invasion. Once the conquest was over, the Cong were forcibly disbanded and over two million people fled the country. More people were killed in two years of Communist peace than in thirteen years of American war. True, the Northern invasion was not an act of international Communism, as we thought, but we had no reason to think it wasn't. Plus, the North had signed the treaty separating North from South in good faith. Our heart was in the right place. Chile: Innocent socialist Allende is overthrown by CIA coup, placing brutal Pinochet in power. WRONG! Allende was not elected fairly. He got less than 36% vote and was appointed by Chile's congress. He had been a KGB operative since the 50s, and maintained his contact with them. Once they withdrew their protection, his fate was sealed. He ruined Chile's economy, the Chilean congress declared his presidency illegal, and Pinochet, acting on CIA reports that Allende would have him killed, did what he felt he had to do. Allende was not assassinated; he committed suicide. Pinochet's wrath was tempered by US connections, targeting only those who actively sought his death while building a thriving economy. "The military saved Chile," said President Eduardo Frei Montalva. US pressure led Pinochet to democratize, and he did, giving up power without a fight. Chile is today a democracy with enough wealth to go around. Iraq: to revenge itself upon Iran, America arms Saddam Hussein to fight Iran, supplying him with horrible weapons. WRONG! The Ayatollah had one goal: to overthrow Saddam and create an Islamic empire. In order to defend himself, Saddam, a Soviet stooge, decided to fight the Iranians. Israel, taking an opportunity to rid itself of two enemies, convinces US that Iraq is less of a threat. US sells decidedly non-lethal items of use, including defenses against chemical weapons, later turned into offensive weapons. Less than 1% of Saddam's weaponry was of American origin. The Iranians had far more, leftovers from the Shah's day. US supports Kurdish rebels in north. Admittedly, a mistake.  Angola: Evil US seeks to place South African puppet in power to protect oil interests. WRONG! The MPLA were dedicated communists, as were the FNLA. UNITA and Jonas Savimbi, black nationalists all, fighting greater weaponry, BEGGED apartheid South Africa to intervene, a decision supported by several black leaders. Two KGB agents captured in South Africa, confirmed the S. Africans' worst fear: the Soviet Union planned to use Angola as a staging ground for an invasion of South Africa. Unlike Cuba, who planned to invade Angola BEFORE S. African troops arrived, S. Africa was at least PART of Africa and had good reason to get involved. And Jonas Savimbi was practically a saint compared to the rest. He allowed full religious freedom and promised to end the fighting if fair elections were held. The Cubans, far from being saviors, stole EVERYTHING they could get from Angola, all with Fidel's blessing. Sidenote: Evil US, to aid South African efforts, puts wonderful Nelson Mandela in jail. WRONG! Mandela, then if not now, was, to be blunt, a communist terorist. He was caught red-handed with enough Soviet-made bombs to blow up half of Johannesburg, and continued to maintain ties to the Soviet Union while in jail, urging more terrorist actions while imprisoned. Nicaragua: Evil US, its business empire threatened by a democratic revolution, forms "contra" army. WRONG! The Sandinista revolution was clearly communist, as their own documents reveal. Soviet documents confirm that the Sandies were agents of the USSR as far back as 1959. The Soviets planted Sandy agents in Mexico to plot US border raids, confirming Ronald Reagan's claims of Soviet plotting in Central America. Despite massive funding from US, Sandies get the Soviet Union's best military hardware, BEFORE any war made it "necessary" to do so. Revolution leaders kick out non-communists and engage in genocide against Indian tribes on coast, led by Cuban officers. Indian peasants, led by mostly former Sandinista commanders, begin "contra" war before any US aid. US puts former Somoza guardsmen in charge. A mistake, but even then, they were mostly dissidents. Terrorists? Not according to OAS, who found little evidence of "dirty fighting" on Contra behalf. "Contras" pledge to end fighting and return to farms once fair elections held. Side: 1984 elections confirm Sandy power. US's Contra candidate crushed in landslide. WRONG! Arturo Cruz was never the "contra" candidate. He withdrew from campaign because Sandinista mobs (turbas divinas) massacre supporters as rallies. When 1990 elections are held, Sandies lose, and have never won another. After war, Contra leaders are assassinated by Sandy hit teams. OAS estimates 500 non-combatants killed by contras; 10,000 killed by Sandinistas. Side: CIA funnels cocaine into minority neighborhoods to fund contras. WRONG! What some people will believe. El Salvador: Evil US supports "death squads" against agrarian reformers. WRONG! US supported miltary government fighting communist rebels supported by Cuba and Sandinistas, while attempting to remove said government in favor of democracy. Jose Duarte, anti-dictatorship candidate elected president. "Death squad" activity, never sanctioned by Salvadoran gov't, drops sharply. El Salvador is now a healthy democracy. Cambodia: Evil US attacks neutral Cambodia, bringing Khmer Rouge greater popularity. WRONG! Cambodian neutrality during Vietnam War is a myth. North Vietnamese soldiers armed Khmers to he teeth. US attempts to STOP Khmer ascendancy by supporting Lon Nol gov't. Side: Evil US, still fighting Vietnam War, arms deposed Khmer Rouge against Vietnamese army and puppet gov't. WRONG! United Nations World Food Program, not under control of US, supplies food to Thai army to distribute to Cambodian refugees, KR among them. China intervenes on KR behalf. Elections are held and KR boycott them, leaving them out of power for good. Afghanistan: Evil US arms Islamofascists to attack nice, friendly gov't supported by USSR. WRONG! The "moderate, reform-minded" gov't was nothing of the sort. The USSR oveethrew a truly progressive Afghan gov't in favor of communist one, which reinstates torture. US attempts to weaken communist hold on power by aiding anti-communists, many of which not connected in any way with Islamic militancy, such as Ahmad Shah Masoud. Soviets invade to protect their oil assets, waging brutal war of deliberate civilian targeting. Islamic militants, negligible in size pre-war, funded by Pakistan, dominate anti-Soviet ranks, in SPITE of US support. (That's right: Bin Laden was NOT supported by US, but by Pakistan.) Soviet Union brought to its knees by war, leading to its collapse. Blum's assertion that the Afghan war didn't hasten the Soviet collapse are absurd. Many documents confirm it. All of Blum's assertions are like this: they make shocking reading, but are easily rebutted, just like the one that American foreign policy is responsible for Islamic jihad. First of all, Islamic jihad was around long before US. Islamic invasions of Europe and Africa predate US existance. Secondly, not even the terrorists themselves admit that. Their own words confirm Pres. Bush's assertions that "they hate our decadence." General Ion Mihai Pacepa, former head of Communist Romania's secret police, states that Islamic hatred of US is based in anti-Jewish agitation by the Soviet Union. Maybe Mr. Blum should talk to him! Now that Vasili Mitrokhin's Soviet documents are available, Blum doesn't have a leg to stand on. 
 I'm a huge BC fan and I thought his first book was great, I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading it (which looks kind of weird on an airplane). This one misses the mark completely. As a made up account of making a movie, it fails completely. The story and events are rediculously not plausible or funny. He should stick to non-fiction 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 This is some of the most dog-awful, run-of-the-mill rock n' roll ever made. Some of the worst the 80s has to offer 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  .. 
  "Against All Enemies" has them all. Former NSA security advisor, Richard Clarke, manages to encompass almost every episode of White House security policy since the start of his career of working with our Presidents since 1985. In Chapter One, Clarke opens the book with a firsthand account  inside the White House on September 11th. This is the beginning of the Good, the start of the finer part of Clarke's literateness. With detailed accuracy, we assume, he describes the events in the situation room in the White House on as word is just coming in of a terrorist attack. It is a rather dramatic and interesting to see what took place from where the average US citizen wasn't able to witness.    For the next 9 chapters Mr. Clarke writes about his role in the US Government from a first person view, from the beginnings of his career in the Reagan administration to the end in the Bush administration. The first nine provide inside information to the reader about the US's handling of national security. It is also the basis for why a prospectus reader would pick up this book in the first place. The subtitle last time I checked is "Inside America's War on Terror" and not "Inside Clarke's thoughts on why America's executive office is always a failure". Although after reading it, one might believe that was his original title idea. We are fortunate enough that Clarke chose to bestow upon a reader at least two chapters without infecting it with his own blatantly obvious partisan views. Which include Chapter 1; "Evacuate the White House" and Chapter 9; "Millennium Alert". However the rest of the Chapters between one and nine are bearable for the most part compared to the just plain ugly in Chapter Ten and Eleven where the book morphs into  "Against All GOP Enemies". Needless to say the theme has been flowing throughout the entire book, but the ugly part of the book (Chapters 10-11), it is just blatant and glaring to everyone. When you near Chapter Ten, so begins the politicizing of the 9/11 terror attacks.   The first nine chapters are somewhat captivating and entertaining but the last couple are an echo of just about every other anti-Iraq book out there. If that is what your looking for, just search "Iraq War" in Amazon and you may be  blessed with finding a whole book based on the "President Bush`s `failure` in Iraq" endlessly caroled to the point of bloodshot eyes. Richard Clarke isn't Frank Rich (fortunately) so we hope we might be felicitous enough to read something that might contain a bit of originality, which is scarce in the end parts.   He tries to portray himself as a modern day Paul Revere in the war on terrorism. He coincidently had all of the knowledge about Al Qaeda before 9/11 and makes it seem as if the Government saw him as just another "boy crying wolf" Who knows for sure? This is his account and we can take everything as hard-line fact without seeing some exaggerates, discredits, even defamation in between, as written by the hand of God.  Wouldn't there be something Bush did correct during his four years of office? His good friend Clinton had a whole 8 blithesome years to work with his angelic NSA advisor, might be find any credit to a president other than Clinton anywhere in the pages? Giving credit to Bush for anything ends at the extent of  "Bush isn't as dumb as everyone says he is, although he doesn't read many books unlike our immaculate Clinton".   This is not an anti-Iraq book in it's entirety. Perhaps Amazon wishes to sell us that in hopes of the ever so rising polls in disfavor of the war would turn out the "truth-searching" pacifists book buyers. Mr. Clarke does a good job of stuffing every ounce of opposition over every Republican president's foreign policy he has worked with into only Twelve Chapters. Maybe if the 04' elections were so close to the book's release date, we could of expected a lengthier book.  He even managed to stitch a small bit of his dissatisfaction over the 2000 election . Page 244 reads: "What if it (9/11) had happened with Clinton still in office or what if the Fl voting procedure had been otherwise?". A classic Democrat alibi about losing the 2000 election.  An overtone lays within almost all the pages of Clinton= flawless and Bush= evil/oil hungry, stupid, and inept which is murmured to the end. He also makes sure he includes to a reader (potential voter) about Bush's reading habits while in office. It is clear to a reader of any political persuasion that he has clear personal vendettas against many of his former colleagues, including Paul Wolfowitz, late former President Reagan, Steve Hadley, and John Ashcroft. As well as Donald Rumsfeld, but then again who doesn't against him nowadays?  A reader will be bombarded with quotes of Clinton's critics of his attacks on mud huts with a "Wag the Dog" theory to divert attention away from his Lewinsky scandal, a textbook defense of Clinton's foreign policy. Defending bombing Afghanistan and Sudan, makes no mention of what else trigger-happy Bill bombed either or even pizza parities with interns. Clarke entering the business of political criticism isn't afraid of applying double standards in his writing.  He also splendiferously exemplifies playing Monday morning Quarterback with his "thoughts" about the US-led invasion of Afghanistan with a laundry list of "what we could of done better"s. Is there anything the White House could of done to please him? Excluding Clinton, of course. He is critical of every US retaliation (or lack therefore of) to every terrorist attack on Americans since 85'. Mentioning the attack on Marine barracks in Beirut under Reagan, Pan Am Flight 103 during Bush Sr., and September 11th during W. Bush. Are we missing something here? Oh yeah! How about that "small" US warship that was bombed by Al Qaeda that killed 17 sailors and injured 39 almost sinking the boat? Clarke seems rather silent on this attack surprisingly. Dismissing Clinton's failure to retaliate with, it would of disrupted the Arab/Israeli peace talks (Pg.224). Doesn't that tidbit of information merit a bit more than a mere paragraph of mentioning? He was quick to scorn past presidents of failing to retaliate against other attacks, why so taciturn this time? Clarke begins to take note of the attack on Page 227 when discussing Bush beginning to take office in January of 01'. Three months after the tragic attack he says "we could begin to go on the offensive". Thanks Richard, it's about time.  He also calls the American traitor John Walker Lindh "misguided". I would say someone who murders two Americans fighting for their country is more than misguided. A turncoat to start.  He also lacks sources of information. If your going to quote certainties such as "Polls showed 70% of people believe in an Iraq-Al Qaeda connection", some sources would be nice. Critical of the US patriot act, which is surprising for someone who spends his career warning officials about terrorism and security threats. As well as becoming a critic of US relations with the Muslim world. However if you seek any mentioning of the numerous states that are allies in the war on terror (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc.) you probably won't find any listed.   To sum the book up, is to simply say "Against All Enemies" is a memoir of an NSC official unfortunately bitten by the partisan bug but not without some worthy sections to read. The final Chapter is nothing new to readers in 2006. You forget your reading an NSC official's memoir and begin thinking it might be Bob Woodward's book or someone alike. He states the expected; "we did in fact lash out in a largely unilateral and entirely irrelevant military adventure against a Muslim nation (pg. 286)" but he believed Saddam had WMDs before America started out on it's "irrelevant military adventure". Perhaps these mantras constantly chanted today were somewhat new when the book came out in 04'.  If you chose to read "Against All Enemies", Clarke manages to keep a reader's attention with few boring or dull parts. It is an invigorating and insightful account of an NSC official. But if you're an independent seeking the truth, you might want to read an "independent" book, assuming there is such a thing.   
 The worst story is Kenyon !!! I will NOT buy any more in the future!! 
 Over the years I've learned to beware of writers who earn their living inside the walls of academe. It's often a creative trap, and Ms. Moore is no exception. She shows all the shortcomings of a scribe who uses her students as bouncing boards for vignettes, none of which deal with people very far from university life and none of which are in any real sense true short stories. The "in" jokes among her often stereotypical characters may amuse freshmen writing majors, but the average reader looks in vain for any true authenticity (as, for example in the stories of Alice Munro or T.C. Boyle). The shame of it is that Ms. Moore can write--but in this collection she chooses to offer us nothing that holds any attention beyond a clever sentence 
 I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.  It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help.  While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up.  Too Bad 
 Although as a Christian I agree with the principles in this book, one dissapointment is that the book is targeted towards only those who already agree with the author's point of view.  By making fun of opposing viewpoints, dismissing them without logically arguing against them, or simply stating his views without giving reasons, anyone who doesn't already agree with the author would be quickly alienated.  
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 On page 11 of this book, the authors provide a list of what they think are the unifying themes of neoconservatism.  "[One theme of neoconservatism is a] belief deriving from religious conviction that the human condition is defined as a choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character is to be found in the willingness of the former (themselves) to confront the latter. ... [Neoconservatives] analyze international issues in black and white, absolute moral categories. They are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism. ... They disdain country-specific, realist, and pragmatic analysis."  In order to evaluate this passage, consider the following fundamental question: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of political organization is superior to another?  This same question can be posed in the economic sphere: Do there exist methods for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another. In fact, such methods are applied in the economic sphere all the time. For example, the IMF may undertake to determine whether a nation's financial system is sound or needs reforming. Implicit in the IMF's actions are the assumptions that 1.) some forms/features/characteristics of economic organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) the IMF has a methodology for distinguishing between desirable and undesirable features of economic systems. This should not be surprising. After all, businesses like Moody's and Standard and Poors make determinations about the financial soundness of nations and multi-national corporations all the time.  Two more points can be made. First, whatever the basis for the determinations made by institutions like the IMF and the ratings agencies, it is safe to say these determinations are not founded on "religious conviction." (I personally am both a neocon and an atheist.) Secondly, once these institutions have made their determinations, they often seek to use some form of coercion, or conditionality, to force nations with undesirable economic characteristics to modify those characteristics. For example, the IMF may make tranches of funding conditional on certain reforms being implemented in a timely fashion.  We may conclude, therefore: 1.) there do exist methodologies for determining whether one form of economic organization is superior to another; 2.) these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) these methods are not based on "religious convictions," and; 4.) it is not unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming economic organizations that display undesirable economic characteristics.  And yet, if all of these conclusions are true of economic systems, it is not surprising that they should also be true of political systems: 1.) we should not be surprised to find methodologies for determining whether one form of political organization (or a kind of political organization with certain characteristics) is superior to another; 2.) we should not be surprised if these methodologies are applied on a regular basis; 3.) there is no reason to think that the basis for these methodologies is to be found in "religious convictions," and; 4.) it would not be unnatural for multi-national agencies to seek to coerce nations into reforming undesirable political systems.  One may reply to point 4.): "Yes, such actions are appropriate for multi-national agencies, but not for a single nation operating unilaterally. Also, suasion should be used instead of coercion." To which I would reply: "But, what if the multi-national agencies have failed to do their job? Also, suasion and coercion are two points on a continuity. War is merely the continuation of policy by other means."  So, there are certain points that are agreed on (or should be agreed on) by all and some points on which there are disagreements. The points that should be agreed on are: 1.) certain forms of political organization are, in fact, preferable to others and 2.) these preferable forms can be identified and should be encouraged. The points that are not agreed on are: 1.) Who should do the encouraging of nations to change their political forms? and 2.) How should this encouraging be done? As for the points that are not agreed on, I think the disagreements are arrived at in good faith: there are arguments to be made on both sides. But, certainly the Bush administration can make a very strong case that the United Nations has failed to perform its duties in encouraging political reform throughout the world and that war is a proper instrumentality of coercion to effect regime change under certain extreme circumstances.  Let us return now to the passage quoted from the book. First of all, we can see that the idea that methodologies for distinguishing between good and bad political or economic organizations must derive from "religious convictions" is a canard. Secondly, we can see that it is not in the least unusual for agencies to use such methodologies to try to make determinations as to whether particular organizations are good or bad -- to assign "value judgments," in other words. As for the question about how "the character of a politician" should be defined, we can see that, well, yes, the character of a politician, just like the character of, say, an accountant, is, in fact, measured by a willingness to distinguish between good and bad and to oppose the bad. For example, the character of an auditor is determined every day by his willingness to apply a methodology for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable accounting practices and to refuse to sign off on unacceptable ones. We have seen over the last several years what happens to financial markets if this "true measure of character" is lacking. It would be absurd to argue that an auditor who is applying his methodology should be criticized because he is "analyzing issues in black and white, absolute moral categories." The real problem starts when the auditor stops analyzing issues in black and white and begins to blur the picture or accepts the CFO's argument that the company ought to be allowed to present financial information in a "company-specific, realist, and pragmatic" way.  In other words, if the main accusation against neocons is that they seek to apply a methodology to distinguish between good and bad political systems and then stubbornly promote good political systems and oppose bad political systems, then, most neocons, I believe, would probably say that they were guilty as charged. For, compromise in the face of evil is worse than defeatism. It is, in fact, (here is that awful word again that post-modernism and relativism have such a difficult time with) immoral 
 This book was a rip-off of Philip Crosby's works such as "Quality Is Free" and "Quality Without Tears." Just subtitute "Lean Six Sigma" everywhere for "Quality Improvement Process (QIP)" and it's the same methodology for implementation. Book, chapter and verse...  I should know: I worked for Mr. Crosby for four years 
 This book would leave no untrained reader to think Saddam was a good guy or beneficial in anyway for Iraq. The book discusses the former Iraqi president (actually dictator) who killed massive amounts of Iraqi kurds, got hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in an eight year war with Iran that Saddam mostly started and mentions Saddam's takeover of Kuwait. But Saddam is a creep whose bad activities can't be overestimated nor can they can they all be listed and this book doesn't mention how Saddam killed half million Iranians in that war or how much of Iraq went up in flames during that war or how Saddam bombed Tel Aviv with SCUD missiles as part of an attempt to start a whole war with Israel. Missing also is Saddam's second attempt at taking over Kuwait in 1994 plus his misbehavior that caused operation Desert Fox in 1998 plus the fact that Forbes magazine rated Saddam wealthiest man (on earth!) #5 in 1997 at five billion dollars personal fortune and money means power. All this means Saddam was a growing threat when he was taken out in 2003 and it was not just for Iraq but for the sake of much of the rest of the world. The book also fails to mention how Khadafi of Libya quit his own nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam get captured in 2003 by fearing that he (Khadafi) might the next to get captured should he not start behaving himself. An added huge benefit to Saddam falling. 
 After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.   
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 After reading Blood Of Heaven I was quite eager to read Threshold.  Blood of Heaven was a book that I could not put down.  I cared a great deal about the characters  and the storyline was extremely captivating.  I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.  I read the book in 3-4 days.  Well with Threhold I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline was interesting, however I really did not like where he took the premise.  The story was not as focused as Blood of Heaven, Myers seemed unsure of what he really wanted to do with this book.  Some of the characters were interesting, however many of them really did not interest me.  Most of the secondary characters  were not developed at all, they were just there.  Thier backgrounds and motivations were really not developed.  The main character of Brandon was somewhat interesting, however he seemed like a weak character to base a book around, Sarah was a far more interesting.  My biggest problem with the book was trying to visualize many of Brandon's visions, they become more outlandish and outright silly as the book went on.  Brandon's final confrontation at the end did absolutely nothing for me, I could not take it seriously at all.  Years ago when I used to read Stephen King he was able to make just about anything believable, no matter how bizarre and out there it may have been.  That most definately was not the case with Threshold.  Overall I found parts of the book enjoyable.  I did like the resolution and the development of Brandon's abilities.  This book really did not grab me.   I have just started Fire of Heaven, I do hope I am not disappointed with that one 
 I had to buy a new one, and I chose another brand (Logitech) this time.  There is no On/Off button, so the batteries run out if you don't take them out (I think the buttons are pressed during transportation). Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly.  And I had the same problem described in a recent review: "I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen." 
 I bought this CD.  I listened to this CD.  And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum.  I get jazz.  I love jazz.  I "get" spiritual jazz.  This music is a load of crap.  It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity.  That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make.  Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype.            
 I ordered Desiring Italy to read while my husband and I travelled in Italy this year. I had hoped that it would be as interesting as The Italians by Luigi Barzini or Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes.  Unfortunately, I  was disappointed by the book; it did not meet my expectations or hold my  interest so I abandoned it in our hotel room 
 The scenes on the porno set read like some bored housewife's fantasy. I kept rereading them and laughing my head off. The book is awful, only worth  buying for a laugh 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 The updates are frequent and expensive. Good program, but it's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading 
 Be Aware Before you Order! On Oct. 31, 2006 I ordered two cases of bottles through Amazon, to be delivered from Stacks and Stacks. When they arrived, the cases were only 16 count instead of 48 count. I called Stacks and Stacks and a supervisor was to return my call, I received an email instead (supervisor claimed my home number was a fax). She offered to credit me shipping cost ($18.47 for the heavier weight boxes - the 16 count boxes are only 5.99 to ship)if I wanted to keep the boxes, otherwise they would arrange to pick them up. She claimed that J.K. Adams does not make a 48 ct case. I responded that I wished to return the boxes (I had less than half of the bottles I needed, and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled). I have since written two more times and as of 11/16/06 have received no response, no instructions to return, and no credit to my account. I have filed a claim with Amazon A-Z Guarantee, hopefully this will be resolved soon 
 It certainly sounded exciting.  Unfortunately, it's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you've already thought of a hundred times.  That's not to say that the ideas aren't important.  I was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks.  On the bright side, the book won't become dated for quite some time.  
 This ended up being bootleg discs from China.  They didn't work correctly on my dvd player.  I told Amazon and received my money back.  Amazon told me they've blocked this seller. Bootleged material sent through the United States Mail is a Federal offense 
 But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean 
 The old Stats Pro Football Handbooks used to be great when preparing for the upcoming fantasy football season. But the 2002 and 2003 editions are just lousy. Want to check on how bead weather or playing on a grass field affect Marshall Faulk's rushing stats? Don't look here. Want to check on O-line perofrmances vs. divisional opponents? Don't look here. Everything that used to be great about this book is now gone. All it lists are the usual statistics you can find in any magazine or website. What Stats has done to this formerly fine product is a crime 
 I read the statement: Will send in two to three business days. It's been almost one month. I never received the video.  I'm not happy 
 Our daughters are four and five years old.  The skates will not fit over our five year old's shoe.  The ad clearly says three to seven years old 
 Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. "The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the  Brink" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and  moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of  reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, "yes, I know, so what?" Give me  something, anything. I guess was expecting more 
 Back in the mid 1980's I bought a Patton 14 inch high velocity fan; although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name, it is not at all nearly as good as the original. The original actually had three different speeds ;while this one uses three speeds, they are hardly distinquishable from each other; the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version.   The original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version. Oh, yes the original's lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet.  Bad substitute and mediocre fan 
 I ordered in November and I am still waiting to receive this item 
 I have been trying to read this book for over a year.  I can't get into it and I think it's time to throw in the towel.  I have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much.  The stories are interesting but don't really seem to have anything to do with one another.  Too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning.  The upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics.  
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Stephen Kern read a lot, writing his book. His study is a conglomerate of the most important authors, sociologists and philosophers focusing on the shift of time and space concepts in modern Europe. The broadness of his knowledge is the lack of his book, because it is nothing else than a masterwork of the superficial. Combine a little bit of time-philosophy in the novels of Proust, a little bit of brainstorming (Molly Bloom) in Joyce, combined with Einstein, James, Husserl (!), Bergson, Ibsen, etc. and you have a good pseudo-cultural-philosophic consomm. The book is mixture of articles you find in encyclopedias. I am very disappointed, especially with Harvard University Press.  
 Apple Superdrives (DVD-R/CD-R/etc...) don't burn these above 2x. Even recording at 2x speed (about a half hour per DVD, if you use most of the space up) I end up throwing out about 1 out of 4 discs.  2 stars instead of 1, because you get what you pay for. If you have time to wait a really long time for slow burning on these, it would be harder to find a cheaper cost per dvd-r 
 Monica Keena's colagen lips were bigger than this movie's budget. The acting was decent considering its poor script and dialogue- Way to go Monica. No monsters. No darkness. Heaven and Hell consists of nothing more than recycled scenes. Nothing is scarier than realizing how much time you wasted watching it. There's no deep spiritual realization that everyone else claims. - Overall this film was lame. Rent "High Tension" if you're looking for fright or "Kolobus" for lower budget horror. Both  are great!!! 
 This is, as one can guess by the title, an academic book. Obviously it is; it is difficult to say, even after reading it, what exactly it means. Does it refer to "cultures" created by U.S. Imperialism? Or perhaps to  "cultures" created within the U.S. by imperialism? The  predictable answer would be "both," an answer that seems to be  given by the structure of the book itself, which not only includes essays  on the impact of U.S. imperialism on other nations but also essays on the  impact of imperialism "on-shore," so to speak. One such essay is  by a professor named Bill Brown, who writes on, apparently, the  relationship between the Panama Canal and artificial limbs in "The  Prosthetics of Empire." This, to a non-academic, might sound  surprising, but it is if anything rather banal these days. But what is  really interesting about Brown's essay is that, while he seems to be  well-within the crypto-Marxian, post-everything critical theory mish-mash  of what passes for academic thought these days, he has actually, in a  somewhat weird way, entirely transcended those boundaries. How, you might  ask? Well, the answer seems to be that Brown has taken the bold step of not  merely just making assertions, as critical theory types are wont to do, but  he has even dispensed with that old-fashioned technique of the bourgeois  class, and written an essay that does not just merely gesticulate at  argumentation but has left argumentation behind entirely. What I mean is,  Brown doesn't just say that there is a connection between artificial limbs  and the Panama Canal and be done with it; instead he just proceeds as if  there was a connection. This, you might say, is a stunning achievement, and  one has to praise not just Brown, but also his editors for their courage in  publishing it. Of course, not all of the essays in this volume are this  "edgy," but don't be surprised next year when you find used  bookstores awash with it. By then, of course, the work of Brown and his  compatriots will have been denounced as just another victims of cooptation  by the "hegemonic state.&quot 
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 I got a copy of Sundown Towns, after a guy that I occasionally walk with in the early morning told me about the book.  When I went to check the book out, I discussed it in part with the library clerk and another woman. The clerk stated our small town was mentioned in Sundown Towns, and thought the book had been incorrectly researched. Since I'm one of those people that still believe non-fiction should be told as correctly (and truthfully) as possible, I immediately started reading. First page, Chapter One, had me wondering right off the bat.  Having read Professor Loewen's credentials, I must say I was a bit disappointed.  And if he relied only on information he obtained from a convenience store clerk, then he and I haven't gotten off on the right foot. In order not to confuse anyone that might happen to read this review, let me quote Loewen's conversation with the clerk:  	Is it true that `ANNA' stands for `Ain't No Niggers Allowed?" I asked at the  	convenience store in Anna, Illinois, where I had stopped to buy coffee. 		"Yes," the clerk replied.  "That's sad, isn't it," she added, distancing 	herself from the policy.  And she went on to assure me, "That all happened 	a long time ago." 		"I understand [racial exclusion] is still going on?" I asked. 		"Yes," she replied.  "That's sad."  NOW, from the HISTORY of ALEXANDER, UNION AND PULASKI COUNTIES, ILLINOIS on page 371-72 of Part II, Chapter XIV, clearly states how Anna, Illinois came to be named ANNA, which reads:  	During the year of 1853, Winstead Davie, who then owned the most of the land which is now the site of the city of Anna, and Col. Lewis W. Ashley, Division Engineer, who had come into possession of a portion of the same tract, determined to lay out a town at this point.  The proper surveys were made by Francis H. Brown, the County Surveyor, and lots were laid out on both sides of Main Street and the railroad.  Mr. Davie decided to name the town in honor of his beloved wife, ANNA, and under this name, the plat was entered upon the county records on March 3, 1854. 	 To include such a statement that Loewen used to begin his non-fiction book, I would have definitely sought a more reliable source of information than a convenience store clerk, who may or may not have known the correct answer to his question in the first place, but didn't want to appear stupid, especially if he had bothered to introduce himself.  And that's enough said about this part of Sundown Towns. I then went to the book's index and looked up the small town where I live.  I turned to page 187 and there it was, in black and white.  Loewen writes that "according to Robyn Williams, a nearby teacher, Eldorado sported a sundown sign until the 1980s. (Unfamiliar with the term `nearby teacher', I assume a NEARBY teacher is one that does not teach in Eldorado, but in a NEARBY town).  Again, I discussed this statement with other life-long residents, and to the best of everyone's recollection, no such `sundown town' sign existed in the 50s, 60s, 70s, or 80s.  I was, however, told by my mother (another life-long resident) that once upon a time, such a sign was displayed on the edge of Eldorado. When it was removed, I cannot say for sure. But certainly, it was not sported until the 1980s, as Loewen has written, or a nearby teacher stated. Eldorado is a small, close knit town, where very little happens that goes unnoticed.  I won't dispute Loewen's next statement about a white couple adopting a biracial child, and then had raw sewage thrown on their lawn, and other problems that caused them to leave town shortly thereafter.  BUT, I've never heard that story before either. There is a couple that adopted two African American children a long time ago. They still live in Eldorado, the children attended the local schools for twelve years, and to my knowledge they were never mistreated. If Loewen is intent on writing about how the white man has, over the years, mistreated those of a different color and ethnicity, then perhaps he should rely more on the history books that have already been written, instead of consulting convenience store clerks and nearby teachers, who are probably either too young to know, too far removed, or else too ignorant of the facts to comment one way or the other. But no matter what he writes, and God knows he must have spent a great deal of time putting this book together, he should be more certain of the facts. There's enough racial dissension in the world today without authors like Loewen writing books that could possibly create more. 	     	      This type of writing makes southern Illinois look bad enough, but for someone who has never lived here and isn't familiar with the area, to write incorrectly about it, then I guess that really bothers me.  No doubt, my sentiments show in this review. History has painted a very unfavorable picture of the white man's treatment of African Americans and other minority groups, and it is quite sad.  But what, if anything, can we hope to gain if we continue to "pour salt in the wounds", expressing that this very situation still exists today.  Then again, there was a Hurricane Katrina. 	 
 More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV. Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats 
 These guys used to be good to me...Till I heard them live.  And now...they're definitely Not buff at all 
 This novel in Dunning's series about Cliff Janeway, bookseller sleuth, reads quite rough. It is an EASY read because of the unusually large print for a trade paperback, but the plot is disjointed and leaves huge loose ends (and no sign of a sequel). The central section is largely irrelevant to this story and unrequited (but contains a commercial warning to be seriously heeded by booklovers). The good guys and bad guys are caricatures and too easy to spot (with one VERY key exception), while Cliff now is almost bad with simply too hostile a personality. Finally, the ending is more hilariously awkward, quick, and sketchy than it is scary or satisfying. "In a word," this novel is rough, unfinished, hasty, indulgent, a discourtesy by author and editor.   Dunnings first two Janeway mysteries (Booked to Die & The Bookman's Wake) were stunningly different, fresh, and invited me into a world of books, while his Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime was a fascinating radio/love story. The Bookman's Promise was strange and now Sign of the Book is shockingly disappointing. If I happened to read this one first I doubt I would read anothe 
 Originally published in 1952, The Courage to Be by Paul Tillich is a compilation of the Terry Lectures delivered by the author in the same year. Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University Press  The lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting.  To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic.  Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes.  Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat passé and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.  This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.  The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans.   
 I have waited a long time for a book on the Atlanta child murders because I never felt this case was rightly resolved.  However, when I started to read this book, I could not get past the first few chapters.  The writing  was too detailed - it seemed like I was spending three pages on what the  characters ate for breakfast.  I just could not finish this book.  I agree  that this subject is extremely important and tragic, but be forewarned that  the plot really plods along in the beginning 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 Dan Brown is so full of bunk that his breath smells bad! This is a compilation of much of the same garbage that he included in his book. He tries, not very convincingly to prove his points. Someone reading his garbage that does not have a strong Bible based upbringing would be confused by Brown's fiction. I would recommend any other DVD, preferably something more uplifting 
 I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort.  I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I.  Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.  Take your time and read through the "cotton candy" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced 
 I have used LP guides to travel all over the world and this was a major disappointment.  I won't dispute that Randall S. Peffer has spent the last 30 years getting to know Puerto Rico as the book claims.  He knew it very well, it seems, when he wrote the first edition.  When he went back, however, in October 2002 to update the book, I got the feeling that he may have meandered  by locales he had mentioned to ensure the building was still standing, not confirming any of the facts he had originally included on his way to drink "Cielito Lindos" at the friend's house who invented them and has never shared the recipe with any other bar on the island (contrary to Peffer's statement that this is the national cocktail).  We had a good time despite Randall Peffer's sloppy updating.  By the way, the "aphrodisiac" restaurant in Old San Juan is called "OstraCosa" .. a play on words . . . "ostra" means oyster.  "otra cosa" means "another thing" the pun was lost on Peffer despite his fluent Borricua Spanish 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 There are fifteen stories in this book.  However, I only found 5 to be good.  I was disappointed with the novel.  I suggest Beverly Jenkins' books if you want an excellent read 
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 This one was made after Disney died, Billy Mummy is too old for the role he plays, and it's often too dark, and it sometimes really drags.  Mummy's scenes--where he's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy--are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard.  Better to buy Charlie the Lonesome Couger, or the one about the Yellowstone Bears or the earlier version of "The Incredible Journey," the one they only have on videotape 
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors. 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 I'll just write a short review because I can't even bother wasting my time writing for this awful film. Avoid this film at all costs unless you want to torture yourself, it gave me a huge head-ache

 There are lots of writers who try my patience but have something to say and Shriver is one of them. Unfortunately I cannot read a book like this filled with bad writing. Not that the writer isn't talented, she is but the reviewers here who said the book needed a good edit spoke the truth. There is a confusing issue here. How does one get through, say, William Faulkner? Maybe I wouldn't read him at all if his reputation hadn't preceded him? Same for Thomas Wolfe. But they are impelling writers in spite of their long windedness and their stories are interesting. I'm not so sure about Shriver, she certainly, as one reviewer said here, loves the sound of her own voice, or is it the mother here who does? No matter the two are inseperable. Style is also the man,in this case the woman, and I have the feeling that just like I don't like Shriver's style, I would be surprised if I liked her? There's something about Lionel? Lionel, give me a break, Eva Katchadourian, give me a break? The names are characters from Absurdistan. This book represents the low state of editing in the publishing culture of today. "It could'a been a contender," with a thorough edit, its faults override its virtues, and it well plummet into obscurity as will Ms. Shriver if she keeps this up.  I think the problem with the publishing industry is that good editing takes time and money so let's just bypass it and put immaturely crafted works into print. I sympathize with the author, I read how long it took her to get published, but that's really no surprise given how tedious her writing can be, and she was sympathetic to struggling writers in her acceptance speech for the Orange Prize. If I was a judge I would have sent it back to her and pleaded that she get some feedback somewhere on her style 
 I bought this book wondering if it would show me any tips to improve my running technique. The book does serve as a good introduction to running technique and I would suggest the book to a person who knows nothing on the topic.  However, the book left me more convinced than ever before that one cannot improve technique from lessons in a book.  Coaches exist for a reason and this is one of them.  Runners who have great body and muscle awareness are not going to have major problems and thus are not going to need this book.  On the other hand, runners who have poor body awareness are going to need a knowledgable person (a coach) to watch them run and identify the problem. So they don't need the book either and are better of spending their money on a coaching session.  This book might be useful for a student taking a college course in coaching running but that is about it.  Beside this general complaint the book itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The photographs in the book are rather poor.  They are simply clips from a video and suffer from all the problems that causes.  It was really mind boggling to me that the publisher was so cheap as to not pay for a still camera to take photos.  The poor quality images make it difficult at times to really understand what the author is refering to in the picture.  It is most unfortunate that the authors obvious knoweledge is hindered by this  problem.  Further, there isn't a modern fad (running barefoot, neuromuscler training) that the author doesn't fall for.  It used to be "muscle memory" was all the rage.  The book would have been stronger if these issues were left out as the author comes across as pandering.     All in all I think this is a book that might serve some useful purpose for a person who knows little about proper running technique.  But for a person with difficulties it is not a substitute for a some sessions with a good coach.             
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 I would normally not read Barbara Taylor Bradford but my boyfriends' Mom gave it to me as part of a present, so I said what the heck, I'll try it.    Just as disappointing as I'd expected. Light, uninteresting, and with no real plot or ending. As for the historical pages, read Catherine Cookson instead.    I may go back and listen to A Woman of Substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it.  But this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things, and full of too-successful, too-beautiful men and women. Not believable. 
 I made the mistake of purchasing his older book called The A.R.T. of making babies updated edition. Do not buy unless your doing a research paper. This book was written in 1998 and the information is outdated. Make sure you purchase the 2005 edition. I wish amazon.com would have made this clearer. I did read it anyways and had the book  been filled with updated information it could be informative. I found the "Couple's guide to In Vitro Fertilization a much better book. Having recently gone through the procedure it was right on the money and very easy to read and understand 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 I hope no one spends money on this useless rant. Any sane person is left wondering what the hell this author DOES like? I agree that bad sitcoms and People magazine are trashy, but this guy knocks everything! He seems to speak against British pretentiousness, but enjoys sabbaticals in pricey London. He was well-off enough to attend posh universities, all the while knocking the lower-priced ones. He slams the lower and middle classes, while pretending to be "above classism." Not a page goes by where he doesn't insult Reagan. This snob even hates graduation ceremonies, university logos, the flag, and the bicentennial back in '76. The piece de resistance (he DOES love French snobbery) is when he blames the US Navy for Lockerbie. What DOES this clown like? Oh, check out the photo in back. Aren't ugly toupees and shoes without socks BAD 
 I felt cheated after I read this book.  It wasn't fair to draw Scotty so precisely, yet leave the other characters (his family) so undeveloped.  Did anyone ever explain to Scotty that it wasn't his fault that his mother left?  Did anyone ever consider getting Scotty some therapy with a trained counselor?  Did anyone attempt to help Joan before she left?  Too many unanswered questions and poorly drawn characters left me thinking: "This book could have been so much better." What's the point of breaking our hearts if there was never any real substance to begin with?  
 I'm on my second Sassafras pizza stone. The first broke in half after maybe a dozen uses. The second now has distinct cracking after about a half dozen uses. I treat my kitchen tools well, following all care instructions. These are just plain dogs; don't waste your money. The only saving graces are that they're cheap and hence easy to replace, and that they really do help make good pizza 
 Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 I found the formulas to be too exotic. Most of the ingredients  are very expensive. I was also dissapointed that natural preservatives were not discussed. The thought of someone keeping their lotion in the refrigerator is an inconvenience. I want to sell my concoctions, and that can't be done without preservatives 
 I had high hopes for this one and ended up pretty disappointed. Yes, the writing is wonderful, and I enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the walking tour--it's the only thing that kept me reading, actually. But Susan's  apocalyptic near future is too mysterious. So is the reason she is only now  trying to figure out what happened during her parents' trip. You can't help  expecting that there is going to be some link--even only  psychologically--between this trip gone wrong and the world gone wrong that  Susan lives in--but no, there doesn't seem to be. We don't even know what  happened to the surviving two members of this foursome after the trip. Nor  do we have any idea who Susan is or how she changed because of what  happened. I also disliked nearly all the walking tour participants.  Ruth--blah, Bobby--yuck, Brenda--awful. And while Carole intrigued me, I  was never convinced of her supposed instability except for the very bizarre  postcards she sent to the poor 13-year-old Susan. In the accounts of the  trip itself, she often seemed like the most understandable member of the  group. And then Monkey--who was he, so menacing and perceptive and  intrusive. And in the end, apparently an artist as great as Carole, as  well. All in all I think it could have been a better read if Davis had  provided just a bit more of a foothold in Susan's world 
 Having received this book as a gift, I opened it hoping for a lot. What I had was a lot of annotations for many obvious words, as well as editorial interpretaions that I feel are limited and incomplete, indicating that the editor is unfamiliar with Austen scholarship. JANE AUSTEN FOR DUMMIES teaches you a lot more about ALL of Austen's novels 
 As a lover of film noir and proud owner of most that are on DVD or VHS, I can say without hesitation that this is one of the very worst ever. The only reason I gave it two stars, instead of one, was because of the fine performers who were saddled with this inane script.  Joe Ferrer's hypnosis of Gene Tierney to allow her to sleep is nothing compared to the yawns brought about by the agonizingly slow pace, lack of action, and interminable pauses between lines. At one point, Gene Tierney swears that she hasn't been lying, and you find yourself wanting to respond: "Of course, you haven't. You haven't said anything of import."  The storyline makes absolutely no sense. Jose Ferrer has set up the perfect crime so what does he do? He returns to the scene for no apparent reason other than to be captured. He hypnotizes Gene Tierney to steal incriminating evidence and then has her place the items where they will inexorably be discovered.  A complete waste of wonderful performers. Cross this one off the list, and donate the $9.99 to your favorite charity. Or pourchase "The Dark Corner," a truly memorable Fox noir with an outstanding performance by a breathtakingly gorgeous Lucille Ball 
 I've only read half the book, and don't plan to read the rest.  While the subject is certainly worthwhile, the execution is, in my opinion, poor.  Mr. Trent's writing isn't particularly good.  The characters are broad caricatures, to the extent that St.-to-be Cyril becomes a comic villain.  I could picture him twirling a Snidley Whiplash-style moustache while scheming against the non-Christians.  There also seems to be an obsession with sex on the part of many of the characters (whether for or against it).  I won't speculate on whether this reflects the author's state of mind, or whether he somehow felt it was integral to the story.  I would expect that a scholarly biography of Hypatia's life would be a much more satisfying read.  If it's done nothing else positive, this book has at least made me curious about the history of the Library of Alexandria, and the librarians and other scholars who studied there. 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 I have not been a able to find a good book on covered calls yet.  I understand most of the process but too many of these authors simplify the process.  There is too much "slippage" in the process and you have to watch your timing on using covered calls.  This is not a strategy that everyone can easily use and be successful 
 This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through 
 In this book, Johnny-come-lately and self-styled "true New Yorker", Daniel Libeskind shows how little he understands the people and pulse of our city.  He makes fun of his poor immigrant doorman because,  "he probably gets his view of the world from reading the New York Post".   Later, like the coward he must be, Libeskind uses his book to make snide remarks about the quality of business suits worn by other New Yorkers he was asked to work with on the Ground Zero design team.  And he takes sick, greedy pleasure in describing how he arrived fresh at the New York office one morning, delighted to find that his "architects emerged red-eyed and exhausted, not having seen their families-or sunlight-for weeks. They looked like newts, their skin tender and gray-green".   So I shouldn't have been surprised that when Libeskind met his wife, he jumped to the conclusion that, (and I am quoting from this book), "She is so beautiful, she must be stupid."  What a self-centered and boorish snob!!    By the end of his own book it was obvious why this offensive putz had been kicked off the project.  He obviously can't stand anyone but himself.  His unsupported claim that only his design somehow represented American values (he doesn't explain how??), or that the form of the building paid homage the Statue of Liberty are no more than cheap media-seeking gimmicks.  The whole book reeks of such insincerity.    Al-Qaeda did enough damage at Ground Zero.  New Yorkers don't need Libeskind's phoniness adding insult to the injury.   -  This is not a book about designing for New York, or about becoming an architect.  This is a book about one man becoming a full-time schmuck 
 According to Hawthorne, this is not a novel, it's a Romance, and not just a Romance, but an Allegory, fraught with Symbolism, to illustrate a MORAL. The end result being that Hawthorne's characters are a cartoonish, unconvincing bunch, uttering stilted dialogue like a troupe of half-baked Shakspearean hams declaiming away in some tawdry, gaslight melodrama. Hawthorne frequently brings the story to a dead stop so that he can inflict on the reader his generally negative opinions on art, Rome, Italians, etc., reserving most of his venom for Catholicism. In spite of all that, he does succeed in telling a story, even if he does cheat the reader out of a satisfactory ending.  If you want to read the Fall of Man, acted out by arty Americans in 19th century Rome, you're better off with "Roderick Hudson" by Henry James. James took the basic elements of Hawthorne's novel and came up with a much more rewarding book 
 This movie starts out with an incomplete back-story, 500 years before the main story.  But, unless someone is well versed in the Bible, or the Torah, the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment. It jumps to the main story for a few minutes, then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs, but it's still not clear what is going on.  The description says Hadassah hid her religion, but it's not as hidden as you'd think it would be.  Over and over again, she and her uncle talk about being Jews, the housekeeper calls them Jews, their friends call them Jews, and there are even more flashbacks to Hadassah's childhood showing how she grew up Jewish.  She even reads from a scroll of a Biblical tale to children in the market.  If this is how she hides her religion, I'd hate to see what she'd do to flaunt it.  Actress Tiffany Dupont tries to give Hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world.  She's a teenager longing to explore her roots, and the world at large.  This would go well in having teens relate to her, but the dialog gets in the way.  The writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the Bible.  The complex dialog is spewed out, sometimes as quickly as possible, without any real inflection.  This causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable.  And, unfortunately, even the more seasoned  actors stumble over the formalized wording, further distancing the viewer from the story.     If you're really into Biblical stories, then maybe you'd enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic, it's best to look elsewhere.  (I could only endure a half-hour. 
 I first read this book in 1994 and remembered it being unuseful and his kitchen-talk economics being superficial.  So, 11 yrs later I picked it up again believing that it was my own lack of understanding and maturity that made me under-appreciate Soros.  But, I was wrong.  Pros: Chapter Chapter 3 is about his approach to the currency market speculation.  This is probably the most useful part of the book for an investor or market observer.  Currencies are, after all, entirely relative to each other, particularly after the fall of Bretton Woods. He simplifies his model into eight variables (nominal FX, nominal i, price levels, gdp, capital flows, hotmoney flows, trade account, and govt budget) and then talks about how a virtual cycle appears when the market perception itself feeds price movement, which in turn fuels the perception that the perception was correct.  This culminates in incorrect pricing and thus opportunity.  This approach is not unlike other int'l/macro hedge fund managers today.  Cons:  He has lengthy diatribes around his overabundant belief that he's a great-mind in philosophy and economics.  Reflexivity is nothing more than the notion that market participants affect a price, but that prices are dynamic and constantly influenced by perception -- and here's the GREAT insight -- and perception sometimes is misled by unfounded herd momentum.  He applies this model to the stocks, currencies, and credit vs regulatory cycles in the book.  However, Billionaire make not a Worldly Sage...  For example, he debunks all academically-taught economics by comparing the "Perfect Competition" model to his Reflexivity.   Well, of course, Perfect Competition is not reality and Supply/Demand are not discrete lines that nicely intersect on Wall Street at 4:00pm every business day!  Every student of economics understands that.  Its too bad that Soros's 1950's college-level economics didn't introduce him to more challenging concepts and higher level models (no offense intended towards Princeton).  He does similar things to metaphysics, which can be best described as a little better than yet-another-Hollywood-actor describing existentialism.  His arguments follow an annoying pattern: (1) oversimplify a current model and debunk it, (2) apply his Reflexivity theory onto the situation, and (3) philosophize about life's implications.  I can almost see him take a cigar puff then as minions sit gasping at his profound teachings, as if from Kant and Samuelson -- combined.  He readily admits in the introduction and thoroughout the book that he's writing real-time and out of sequence when he has time.  So, the style of writing follow an initially focused set of themes, then meander about as if he's punching the keyboard at 2:00am.    In summary, this book will NOT give you insights into the mind of one of the most profitable hedge fund traders in the world.  He will not tell you his techniques (like "How to Trade like a Hedge Fund"), nor will he allow you into his inner feelings and personality (like "My Life as a Quant") so that you can walk away with something useful tomorrow.  Rather, he's telling you what he wants and drags you along for a ride with verbose pages -- after pages. 
 A WOMAN SCREAMING AS SHE'S BEING BRUTALLY RAPED WITH A LIVE CHICKEN BY A MANSONESQUE LUNATIC. HOW CAN ANYONE USE THE WORD "FUNNY" TO DESCRIBE THE TORTURE OF A POOR ANIMAL STRUGGLING IN VAIN TO FREE ITSELF BEFORE IT'S BEATEN TO DEATH? POLYESTER WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE WATCHING IT, OR ANYTHING ELSE BY WATERS AGAIN. 
 This book has no idea what should be prioritized and what shouldn't. Also, the narrative is a rambling mess.  Ex: They spend 10 excruciating pages on Stalin's agricultural and industrial reforms, but contrive to cover the entire holocaust in all of 10 LINES! 'Nuff said!  I got a 5 on the AP exam quite comforably, but no thanks to this ridiculous book 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 this isn't not worth buying or even staring at. i mean if you read it you might be thinking right now...why do people even bother read these reviews this is a horrible book imma watch tv! i defenetly recomend throwing this book away i don't even know why they made it a book.  this is the worstest thin i have ever read. i have seen the show and it's ok...only when it ends i can't beleive people actually like this stuff 
 Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books.  Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few.  But this Lawford book has at least one error per page.  Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical.  Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a "bobble."  Do you think he meant bauble?  He mentions a cat with a "gastronomical" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal.  Was there any editing done at all?  Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom.  Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/"recovery" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written 
 The text is wordy and often redundant.  Some issues are discussed with far too much detail and reiteration while others are statements without meaningful diatribe.    I did enjoy the historical presentations but the spiritual presentations were difficult to cull through and not very enlightening 
 I've never been SO disappointed in a book in all my life.  I purchased this book via reader "recommendations" and found it to be repeatitive and convuluded mumbo jumbo!  This book is a train wreck - it's badly written - bad structured and repeatitive beyond words.  The authors style of writing is choppy (at best) and through their words, the author(s) both write like a couple of ex hippy generations self-help wannabees.  If you really want "help" with your relationship (or how to improve them)....I would suggest looking elsewhere.  This book isn't worth the paper it's written on 
 I personally cannot believe that a few of the artists in this book gave their o.k. to the author of this book. Most of the tattooers have no business trying to teach anything. I believe that if I were going to do this type of book, I'd take a little more time to get with better artists doing cooler tattoos. Even the Capo piece is lacking....it looks like he gave up on the clothes after spending too much time on the face. All in all, if you are a basement tattooer with no prior knowledge, you'll probably learn enough to really scar someone....if you're a professional tattooer with $17 to buy the book, then you probably already tattoo at least as well as anyone in the book. Its worth a read just for a laugh! 
 I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan but I simply can't say anything good about this film.  The plot is horrible, the acting unconvincing (even Berenger), the dialouge laughable and the ending, well, sour to say the least.  The pits 
 After one play through it was obvious why this was her worst selling CD. I will admit to liking some of Spears earlier stuff but on this CD she abandons her pop styling to go more hip hop. Sure that may appeal to a new audience but in honesty, if you liked the other stuff, this ain't that. If you were not bothering with her because you liked hip-hop and couldn't bother with her pop, there is no reason why you would have paid attnetion to it 
 HAVE NOT SEEN THE TEXT YET TO RE 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.  Compared to this album, his follow up Powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser.  Find him working at a McDonalds near you soon!! 
 I'll admit -- I don't like Rush one bit. I listen to his show to find out what the creepy side of America is being told to think. But I did check out this book, and it's slightly better than I expected. That is to say, it's considerably better than Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter's stuff.  He doesn't rant or rave.  But still, I found very little in this book that is true or accurate or even honest. IMO, if you don't buy into his prejudices already, you won't find much to agree with 
 The whole movie was a showcase for Peter Sellers spoofing and fooling around without any direction.  That's why he needed Blake Edwards and not the Blake that let him go whole hog on this picture.  It was nonsensical and a total waste of time.  I was so disappointed as we had planned to have a fun evening with, we thought, would be a Peter Sellers delight, not a Peter Sellers nightmare 
 The basic ideas underlying this book - that people should follow their dreams, work at what they enjoy, don't blindly follow the crowd, etc., are unquestionably good ideas. But the expressions of these ideas as espoused by Mr. Simmons in this book should give every parent pause.    Some examples - in the introduction he talks about African rituals such as putting a child's hand in a bag of ants as a ritual of becoming an adult. He then proceeds to directly equate this with the 'ritual' of attending school. His intended argument is that one should not consider oneself a 'bad person' because of poor performance in school. Feeling good about poor performance might be the politically correct thing to do these days, but I don't think it's the message most parents want their child to receive from a book such as this.    A couple of pages later a list of facts is presented that show that failure in school is not a 100% reliable predictor of failure in life. True enough, but all this is presented in a context that seems to say its OK not to study, that its OK to fail if you don't like school.    He further goes on to say that an education is becoming less and less valuable over time as evidenced by the idea that a high school education used to set one apart, then a college degree was required, and "this transition from the respected to the expected is now occurring with the master's degree." Similarly, "internships have become devalued" as more and more people get them. I could not disagree more. In today's environment where people compete globally, more and more education is required just to complete.     Among many other similar examples, one in particular stands out. In chapter 12, the case of Jubair Chowdhury of a company named Sybess Technologies (a web address is given, but the company apparently no longer exists) is presented. Mr. Chowdhury decided that, in order to save time and get into business right away, he would drop out of school, get a G.E.D., "focus on his business for a few years, and then go on to college." The author says that he "like[s] this path because it bypasses paying dues (high school)". While I may be wrong, my guess is Mr. Chowdhury probably now wishes he had stayed in school.    There is some good information in the book about networking, the value of compund interest, and other basic concepts. However, most of these can be found in many other books that do not proclaim themselves to be "extreme."    I bought this book with high expectations that it would give my teenage son some good ideas about life and living. I was very disappointed. This is pushing young people in the wrong direction. Yes, entrepreneurship and "extreme endeavors" are vitally important to the future of this country, and we need more people to adopt these attitudes. But this book is on the wrong tack when it disavows the value of education.    I am having my son read "The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People" instead 
 The chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch, however, it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate.   The 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack.  I had intended to use it as a cold mask only.   
 The manual helped my husband in writing his reports in the APA format. The only thing he recommends is that there should be more examples in the book. At times, he has to search for the items that were not clear in the internet 
 After reading this you'll want to nail somebody to something to.  What type of spirit in the word spiritual did the writer of these musings mean.  After this man is departed they will have to add another circle to hell.  This is just sacarine coated nausious rubbish.  I despair at some publishers sometimes. 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 I never freakin got this calendar cause they don't have anymore in stock or something. And I get Harry Potter movie calendars every year. It sucks 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 The text would be more focused, cheaper dollar-wise, and generally improved if the auther cut out all of the examples.  They are essentially worthless.  I really enjoy this material, but every time I go to the book as a reference, it's like watching a Golden Girls marathon, completely unbearable.  I end up wading through example after example never finding any real substance ...and there is only one chapter on random processes!  In short, too many examples make theory hard to find and follow.     
 I've had very bad experience with this vacuum. It is bulky, heavy, and inconvenient. Also, the cord is too short if used in a big house. Carrying it up and down stairs -- forget about it! After all these trouble the engine got fried. Then, the interesting part started. I contacted Sanyo for warranty work. They referred me to some service center, which was out of business. After going back and forth they accepted their mistake and pointed me to some other place which is very far from me and I am in Chicago area! So, there is 1 Service center to serve 12 million people. Don't buy it! Horrible product, plus no service 
 We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not "up to snuff." If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose 
 Initially my Tomtom One was excellent. Then I made the fatal mistake of allowing Tomtom Home to automatically upgrade the software. The device never worked again because it could no longer find any satellites! (My computer has the maximum security offered by Windows XP and Norton Internet Security so it seems unlikely that the process was contaminated in any way.) On 11 Feb - I contacted Customer Service - nice courteous responses but no solution. Finally, on their advice, I returned it to the retailer on 27 Feb. It finally arrived at Tomtom Service on 8th March. That was the last I have heard of it!!!   I rang Tomtom Customer service on 2nd April and they could not trace the unit. Over the following 2.5 weeks I tried a series of faxes and online service queries but have received absolutely no human intervention or assistance. In summary - I bought a "good" product, the online software stuffed it up and, over the following two months, Tomtom service achieved nothing except for apparently loosing my Tomtom!!!  Postscript:  Finally, almost two months after seeking replacement of the faulty item, I have been advised that it is to be replaced. No apology or expression of regret from Tomtom but at least I will have a GPS. Even though I vowed never to tangle with Tomtom Customer "Service" again, and I am free to choose the replacement model and manufacturer, I have found that Tomtom One still offers the best performance/price balance for my purposes. I just hope that my new Tomtom runs well so that I will not have to be "serviced" again by Tomtom 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 This is my far the most boring epidemiological text I have ever read.  The author fails to correctly explain terms that he uses and displays a lot of arrogance on his part (i.e. "obviously this is blah blah blah" occurs 2-4 times in every page.  This is supposed to be "an introductory text" and should help/facilitate learning of epidemiology for the beginning student.  The author does not explain new terms in complete sentences but in a philosophical manner, has too many poor as well as good examples, and tries to elucidate mathematical logic with overly wordy descriptions.  C'mon, just show us how it is used without making us read a whole page about it!  After reading chapter 3 and 4, I can honestly say that I will NEVER read another book by Rothman again.  That's my 2 cents 
 Perhaps I was expecting too much from the title of this book. There is nothing "unofficial" about the information it contains. The hotel descriptions are very standard guidebook material - lots of facts, but not  enough of a description to give you a feel of the properties.  I have  stayed at several of the properties listed in this book and they could have  easily included some information that IMHO would have been crucial to your  enjoyment. Also, very little information is provided on things to do on  each island outside of the usual tourist attractions. Maybe I am being too  harsh. After all, Frommers and Fodors aren't any better, but since this  book is touting itself as the "unofficial guide", I feel that  it's a bit of false advertising 
 If you are a fan of Kurosawa (as I am), then avoid this film at all costs, for there is nothing more depressing than seeing a once-great director, who revolutionized filmmaking and examined powerful human themes, reduced to making sentimental nonsense like "Madadayo." And what a monumental waste of time this is--so unrealistically sentimental as to make one wince at times. The use of near amateurs in minor roles does not help. This story (such as it is) is about a retired teacher whose former students (who all happen to live nearby, apparently) remain devoted to him, in a sort of Christ-and-his-disciples relationship. They visit frequently, build him a new home after the War, hold lavish birthday parties for him (and spend 30 minutes of screen time helping him look for his lost cat). What makes these students so devoted is never explored at all--Kurosawa just expects us to take it as fact. This leads to the painful conclusion that "Madadayo" depicts Kurosawa's idealization of himself: as a kind old man inspiring continuing devotion in his former proteges. "Madadayo" also explains why Beat Takeshi and others in the new generation of talented Japanese filmmakers had become so disgusted with Kurosawa toward the end of his career. --MellowMonk.co 
 Good as collectables, not so good as actual toys that you play with.  My daugter has broken the hook off of Mater (bought her a new one), broken the wheel off of Dynaco McQueen, and broken the front axle off of the tractor. Mater's tow equipment is made with a softer cheaper plastic than the rest of the toy, and I expect the new one to break any day now.  Without being too sexist, I want to point out that my 4 year old daughter is probably more gentle on them than the average boy playing with them.  They have never entered a sandbox.  They have not been stood on, nor thrown, nor been monster-trucked by a bicycle.   While I will still probably buy more, as my daughter loves the Cars movie and wants to own them all, (including Frank, which they do not make)  I would say to all: buyer beware 
 This was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son.  Unfortunately, the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play, and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later.  Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too.  He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet 
 My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the "dreaded" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 i love RL, but this is blasphemy. if you want beats, go buy a friggin 50 cent rekkid. blues music, esp RL, is all about pure raw emotion. this rekkid is the output of a computer program, and thats exactly what it sounds like....every beat exactly on time,  precise, sterile.....i hate this rekkid, its really awful. shame on fat possum....they used to be about documenting a pure, dying art form. now fat possum is all about "updating" the blues to "increase the audience"...fat possum only cares about the $$. 
 Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans.  I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it.  I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs?  Attrocious!  These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll.  The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots.  The production is over the top and bombastic.  Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made.  
 This book gets to the heart of what really constitutes a book review.  Does a book get X stars because it is grammatically correct?  Because the reader happened to like the subject matter?  Because the author is adept at using descriptive adjectives?  I don't really have an answer to that general question, so let me just say I gave the book a low rating because of the effect it had on me.   Frances Mayes obviously knows how to write well technically.  Nobody needs me to tell him that.  The problem for me was the way the author conveyed her choice of subject material.  She soon began to sound quite self-indulgent and self-absorbed with this "pert orange rind", that "meandering back road", this "raised fork" and that "riotous bougainvillea".  It felt eventually like I was reading about someone  partaking of a huge buffet of the senses.  Interesting for a short time, but for over 400 pages?  The book became numbing and repetetive.  Perhaps this is the result of patching together the various vacations she took over the 5-year period and using the same formula to convey the impressions of each one consecutively.  I would have enjoyed the book if it had been about 250 pages shorter and had concentrated on just one geographical location.  And if there had been more of the "location" described, and less of Frances Mayes' perceptions of it.  It really seemed as if she was writing for an audience of one; herself.           
 I love Bentley Little - ordinarily - but this short story stinks!  Not too much more can be said about it.  Boy meets dead dad in closed mall, dead dad wants boy to kill mom, boy doesn't kill mom, that's about it.  Save your money on the 'real' novels, and if you haven't read it, start with 'The Ignored' for a book that is worth the money 
 I saw this film on IFC. It was a very interesting film with great acting by Molly Parker. I order this film, and low and behold they had chopped it to pieces. It was hard to understand the characters. All the necrophilia scenes were severely cut and this is what the film was all about. Do not waste your time buying this if you want the whole film. Wait for a director's cut which will hopefully show the film for what it was meant to b 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 Poorly written.  Disorganized.  No new information.  Not worth the time it takes to read it... or the price 
 One of my roommates recently received this books as a gift. My curiousity got the better of me, and I picked it up to peruse it. With my sincerest apologies to the author, this has to be the worst version of any thesaurus I have seen to date. Of just a few words I decided to look up, and by no means were any of the words for the "extremely literate", I was unable to find even one of them. The volume of words in the collection are extremely limited, and synonyms provided are also limited. There are much better books available, in fact, almost any other thesaurus is better, even "pocket versions" of another thesaurus would prove more useful. My guess is that this book is the choice of the egotistical; a bookshelf trophy that serves no purpose other than to suggest superior intellect, and collect dust. The only positive aspect I can think of towards this publication is that it is sure to make the insecure feel "extraordinarily literate". If you want a valuable resource to broaden your vocabulary, this isn't the right book 
 I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable 
 First off, some of the scenes are beautifully filmed. Rich colors and angles. That's the only good thing, besides seeing Mia Farrow. The deaths are all a little complicated when executed...like a Mouse Trap Game. A roofer bumps a hammer, the hammer slides, hammer falls, striking metal thing on side of building, which swings downward and beheads. A lightening bolt strikes a spire, the spire falls from roof, spears stained glass, impales victim to ground, glass shards rain on the victim. Also, this death was filmed in a gloomy rain storm, but when they show the guy impaled, the gloom has lifted to almost sunny. Immediately.  Another mistake is when the father and the photographer meet a guy in a temple. The guy shows them swords that he unrolls from a canvas case. The dad and the photographer run outside, but the photographer grabs the swords and case and does not roll them back up. Outside, the dad and photographer argue. The dad shakes the case at the photographer and the case is rolled up and the swords put away neatly ina tight bundle. Oops...a goof.  Also, in the extras...the director's vocabulary is pretty rough. He must have been a sailor. Every sentence has the f word 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 I sat down in Borders and read this in half an hour.  I am a huge Tolkien fan, and know all his works backward and forward, and this was such a terrible thing to see shelved in the bookstore.  It mistranslates names, gets dates and events screwed up, and is simply a terrible reference material.  If you want to know about Tolkien's Middle-earth, pick up Tolkien's books and *read* the things.  Don't take this crappy short-cut 
 To mimic a sentence structure that Mr. Epstein employs ad nauseum throughout his book, a perfect storm of smug vapidness, this.  The author seems to think that he can innoculate himself against the charge of being a snob himself, by admitting to it once in a while.  Fair enough.  But it doesn't keep him from coming off as mean (as in his treatment of the author Phyllis Rose--how ironic that he would talk about her coming across as a snob in her wonderful memoir!) and judgemental (as in his treatment of vegetarians whom, and he annoyingly waffles on this one, he seems to conclude are a self-righteous lot who has made throwing dinner parties a nuisance).    Mr. Epstein is at his worst when he goes on about his fascination with fashionable coats and cigarette lighters.  Boring.  And pitiable, really.  Sorry, but Mr. Epstein's own glaring snobbery overshadows this book of warmed over observations on the subject. 
 Being a player of AOE III, and having purchased the excellent guide by Sybex, I was expecting the same quality, but no such luck.  This guide is almost useless. It doesn't offer the detail to the different civs and does not give enough detail on stats for the different military units.   It spends too much time addressing the campaign, which frankly is one of the lamest aspects of the expansion.  Don't waste your money. 
 I didn't make it up- it's on the book jacket. Only a complete dunce would be blind to this tome's innumerable inconsistencies. Tripe. Pure and Simple. You are warned. 
 This is a horrible book.  I liked "Abduction", but Chromosome 6 is a piece of trash in comparrison.  The main problem is the characters.  They are ridiculously unreal.  At one point, there are two female characters who coerce a workmate into visiting an island although they're in the jungle, and they know that guerilla soldiers are all around the island.  It's like they don't care about life.  Not only that, but they talk like a couple of barbies, like for example: It would be totally fun to check out that island.  Good idea, Melaine, why didn't I think of that!    The girl's first attempt at reaching the island is disasterous.  Guards shoot at them then arrest them.  A few hours later when they are released.  One of the fearless girls says something like: That totally pisses me off.  I'm going to get on that island if it's the last thing I do.  The other fearless girl agress, and that same night, they are trying a different route to get to the island!    They want to get onto the island to check on some monkeys they've been experimenting on.    They try again and then get shot at again, but this time they are able to run away without being arrested.  The next day they try again!  Meanwhile, they call their male companion a chicken for not wanting to go with them because he's scared of being killed!  They rationalize every moronic thing they do.  They say something like: They certainly won't expect us to do it again.  So we should do it!  Duh!    When they get to the island, they find the monkeys, but these monkeys are big.  Almost two hundred pounds.  For the next few pages, these three idiots are debating whether they sould approach these monkeys for, "a better look," but they are afraid they might scare them away!  What!  Scare away two hundred pound wild animals?  If I would have been there, I would have been running so fast in the opposite direction that I could have run back on the damn water!    The monkeys obviously almost kill them all!  Didn't see that coming, yeah right!    Anyhow, the book is filled with stupid characters running through a forseable plot.  It stunk.    
 This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com 
 The pages of Men's Journal used to be an escapist   weekend getaway in themselves. They brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11. Since that time, MJ has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be, which might have been fine for one issue. This is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas 
 Terribly weak compared to her other work 
 Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours.  After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave.  I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to ....  Thanks, Logitech.   -Keit 
 Saw the other review and had to share my similar experience. The glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing. It's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings. I have to return it because I know will get angry every time I pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess 
 Have listed at least one non-existing restaurant in London. The other suggested  restaurant had a different name from the one specified in the Guide. We almost went hungry. Do not buy this book 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 It's an entertaining book, it's a pity that the author has appearently done his research at 'Something Somebody Said Once University'.  The number of history blunders, plain falsehoods, and misinterpetations is staggering. It's a shame, because Mr. Allen has a great style. Not reccomended at all, I'm afraid 
 I bought this book for my 4 year old, thinking it would help us to train him to stay dry at night. In actuality, it is for children dealing with the stigma of bedwetting. The book emphasizes how it is OK to wet the bed and OK for Mom to constantly change the sheets and wash the PJs. It was not what I expected...I think it would be good for a child who is having serious psychological damage due to bedwetting, but not for a 4 or 5 year old 
 This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20.  I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.  
 If you are looking for new material about Tesla, do not buy this book.  The only thing that is told about these so called lost journals is that they are lost (stolen by MIBs, of course)!  The rest of the book is a compendium of conspiracy theories using Tesla's name as a come on for you to keep reading.  After a few pages, it gets very boring. In summary, no new material here, just Tesla's name used to get you to read the authors' conspiracy theories 
 This is definitley Deborah Harrys worst solo album. It is overproduced, too slick and has no soul. Jocelyn Brown's backing vocals are also extremely out of place. The only decent track is the classic "French Kissin' In The USA", whilst the album version of "In Love With Love" is truly embarassing (the SAW version was by far superior!). I think Deborah has hit a bum note here. For a real masterpiece, buy her debut album "Koo Koo". Each track is a perfect gem 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 Pretty much everything that needs to be said about this stinker has been said in other reviews -  a ridiculous premise carried forth by astonishingly artificial dialogue.  I tried twice to read it, but life's too short.  Turns out it is one of Meltzer's first novels, maybe his very first.  Subsequent efforts are much better.  Ditch this one and read The Zero Game or The Millionaires. 
 As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information 
 "War Goddess" is a good movie, but have many different versions. In the Spanish version not have nudes but something scenes not see in the Italian or American version with nudes. In this copy your quality is very bad, Your image have many lines and have cut one scene, the wrestling enter two amazons nudes.  This ending with the Sabine Sun victory and this kisses your sister and rival.  In Italian version is suggested the homosexuality enter the Greeks, in this version is cut also. The encounter enter Greeks and Amazons have more things in the Italian version. One change of couples very particular: boy with boy, girl with girl. Is very pity this version.  
 Very basic and largly a disappointment.Too many pictures on free hand excercises .A much better book is Lofty Wisemans SAS Personnel Trainer ,more content ,much better sections on swimming,running,heaps better on weight training and motivation ,not to mention nutrition,the section on maintaining positive thoughts is excellent 
 To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didnt even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.   When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didnt even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series 
 Your description of the Popover Pan did not did not contain "MINI".  The item I wanted was the standard size popover pan, not the mini.  "MINI" should be added to your description 
 As an American child growing up in France I had many testing experiences, but none as grisly as those that befell the future novelist Scott Landon, whose father was certifiably insane and tortured him and his older brother Paul with a sharp cutting knife.  As Stephen King tells it, early trauma caused Scott to retreat to an imaginary kingdom called "Boo'ya Moon" and then, upon emerging, to begin a career as an avant-garde novelist and Pultizer Prize winner.  Along the way he met and married a waitress with five or six sisters, Lisey Debusher, and they lived together for seventeen years until his tragic death two years before the action of the story begins, as the widow, Lisey, tries to get on with her life, dealing with the problem of Scott's archive, and if she finally feels up to disposing of it at a university library.  The remainder of the book is told from Lisey's POV, and this will be what divides King's public, her stream of consciousness-esque perceptions of every little thing of the past and present, both in Maine and in Boo'ya Moon, and the way she feels the presence of her dead husband ever near.  Most of the firestorm will be because of Lisey's pet catchphrases.  It isn't enough that she comes herself from a family ripe (overripe) with pet phrases, all of them revolting, but she married into another, and then she and Scott developed their own secret lover's code, and the reader can hardly keep it all straight.  You read on for a page or two, thinking, this can't possibly get any more precious and affected, and then, bang, you have no smucking idea.  The book improves as it goes along, although a subplot concerning Lisey's ribald older sister, Amanda, and her penchant for cutting herself, is nothing but improbable Lifetime Television for Women nonsense.  A second subplot, that focuses on a conspiracy between a scholar and a sociopath to wrest control of Scott's papers from his widow, is even more unlikely, and King's latest supervillain, the nutty Jim Dooley, is very much like the John Turturro character in the SECRET GARDEN movie.  Why does King even bother to give him a new name, it's the same character--King's fantasy of his crazed reader, I suppose.  The sexual torture of women is very much Dooley's thing and something terrible happens halfway through this book that repels me even to think about.  After forty books I am now thinking, Stephen King, your mind is a swamp and this writing excites you.  Okay, now this is one of those things that, for me was a dealbreaker.  Say you were the widow of one of the nation's top novelists, a working class woman who had come into a great deal of wealth.  Say you're now worth 20 million dollars, as Lisey is.  And say you had received telephone calls from a sexual psychopath saying he was coming to molest you.  And say he had put a dead cat in your mailbox.  Wouldn't you seek protection?  Couldn't you afford, say, a bodyguard?  Or would you do as Lisey does and just call the sheriff and nod off when he tells you that sorry, he can't help you?  Of course it's insane.  Anybody would have called a private security firm and in fact, gotten the hell out of Dodge and holed up in Ibiza until your 20 million dollars had tracked the sociopath down and had him disposed of  by hook or by crook.  No commentators have mentioned this point, so perhaps it hasn't occurred to anyone else . . .  but it led me to think, why indeed is Lisey so wealthy--I mean, why is it necessary to the story?  Wouldn't the story have worked just as well if she was an average everyday person struggling to make ends meet?  Has King forgotten that there are people who aren't zillionaires?  (In fact, why is Scott even a writer?  How was that necessary to the story?  Couldn't he just have been an accountant or something?  How many of King's heroes have been tortured novelists, it's tedious to even try listing them.)  Every now and then, King's publishers make a big deal out of his literary skills, and he drags in his "quality" writing friends to provide promising blurbs.  Amy Tan went to town to sell us BAG OF BONES.  The end of the DARK TOWER series was heralded as a major moment in contemporary writing.  Now Michael Chabon tells us that LISEY'S STORY represents some sort of gravitational shift in ecriture.  The truth is that all these books have been really terrible.  Is it just Chabon's star fever that prevents him from seeing this?  I won't be fooled again 
 I have heard a lot about Richard Matheson, and when I found out he'd written a survivalist fiction story (a favorite sub-genre of mine)I was elated to read it.  However, after a long arduous struggle to continue reading, I realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected.  "Hunted Past Reason" tells the story of two men: Doug and Bob.  Bob, a writer, wants to write a novel of backpacking.  Doug, the expert, is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade.  Right from the start, we are privy to the personality clash between the two.  Doug starts out as a "know it all" to Bob.  He tries to bludgeon Bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness.   As the story progresses, we see Doug's jealousy of Bob's successful career and family life come to the surface.  I must admit that the subtle changes in Doug are blended very well into the story.  On the other hand, the story was dragged out far too long than necessary.  After philosophical discussions between the two (which are strained at best), we see Doug's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two.  After a graphic rape scene, Doug gives Bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into "Deliverance" (as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out).  The writing seems to be quite repetitive.  The mental conversations between Bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out.  Being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction, I was mildly entertained by the reading, however, I expected a bit more from Matheson (simply because of his fame and influence he's had on other writers ).  Maybe I was a bit unfair, but the other reviews tell me otherwise 
 This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured.   
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 The worksheets are helpful in applying what Malphurs has just covered. The book is loaded with practical hints and tips. The biggest drawback is that Malphurs relies too heavily on statistics that are questionable and cites some that contradict each other. By that I mean that he cites a statistic about 'Protestant' churches which includes Mormons and Jehovah's Witness. Instead I would recommend Stuart Murray's "Church Planting: Laying Foundations" 
 This is a complete repackaging of "A Writer's Book of Days" and the blurbs on the package do NOT warn you. There is no new material at all. If you already have the book, then you have everything the "kit" has to offer 
 After reading A Brief History of Time I decided that I wanted to learn more about Stephen Hawkings himself and how he became who he is today. I picked up this book written by Kitty Ferguson, which is claimed to be a biography and started reading it. After about twenty pages she was done talking about his life and started talking about his theories. This was disappointing to me because I thought the book was a biography.   As I continued reading I became somewhat confused while she told about Hawkings discoveries. The explanations were little or none in trying to get the reader to understand the ideas. It did not help that there were very few small illustrations that were in the book to go along with her explanations. If there were highly detailed color illustrations such as those in A Brief History In Time, it might have been much easier to understand.  I did enjoy the beginning of the book where Kitty goes into detail about the beginning of Hawkings life but I feel like it was just an overview of how he became who he is today. I would not recommend this book, instead I would recommend A Brief History In Time because it is much easier to understand because it has great illustrations and is not so mathematical 
 Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants, it is not high enough and very combersome to use. Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub. HOWEVER, the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger 
 There's no doubt that Mr. Gorman is a talented photographer.  I liked the sponteinity with which he used the camera and the concept.  However, many of the models are a turn off.  They are so skinny that you can see their ribs.  Not the kind of book that I would recommend 
 Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams 
 Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.  Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.  Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.  For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.  I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda. 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 I didn't believe the negative reviews, but I'm a believer now! And I don't mean that I believe in ET! I gave this movie one star only because there was no less-than-one-star choice. I can't decide whether this is actually intended as tongue-in-cheek, but it is chock full of bad science, sprinkled liberally with comedy. The title, however, is very accurate - "Without Warning" - I sure didn't see it coming! By the way, if you would like to purchase a copy of this thriller, I happen to have one that was watched less than once (it was just too overwhelming and I couldn't sit through it all!). Well, gotta go. Have more important things to do, like count fly specks on the wall 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 Two questions seem to be confused in all the debate between creationists and evolutionists: Does nature provide evidence for a creator God ? Does evolution play a role in the living world ?  In regard to the first question, the proponents of creation are, through their amiable but uninstructed zeal, wasting their time and also damaging the case for God by flawed reasoning. Intelligent design arguments are just special cases of arguments for the existence of God from natural form. Such arguments in principle must fail. The existence of God can only be demonstrated by arguments that appeal to the existence of natural beings, not their specific forms. This was shown (seven centuries or so ago) by Thomas Aquinas in his philosophical commentaries. In more recent times, Kant also shows that arguments from form do not suffice. Arguing through existence, Aquinas does prove the existence of God and that He is the ultimate author of all else that exists. For a thorough, and amazingly succint account of the science of being as being, that is, metaphysics, everyone is invited and urged to consult Elementary Christian Metaphysics by Joseph Owens.  There will be an in-class test next Tuesday.  Whether evolution plays a role in the living world must be decided from examination of the details of the material world. The situation is analogous to the question of whether the universe extends backwards infinitely in time; nature must be consulted. Naturally, one who accepts the Bible as divinely inspired will have to take seriously the claims it makes concerning the origin of the world and the origin of life. One attempting to argue on philosophical and scientific grounds in this area is obliged to work through and understand Aristotle and Aquina's writings on nature. The question at hand really comes down to the question of whether natures exist and whether what we call living are natures. Actually, the whole story is pretty much indicated by Aristotle in the Physics, especially and succinctly in book B, 8 and doesn't leave much room for evolution. Let's stop wasting time and instead invest our energies in a better understanding of what biology really does. And for fun how about a few out of the box speculations, such as  taking the Genesis account in its details as a guide to understanding all life ? The text, properly understood, should provide hints to elucidating biology. Go on, I dare you  
 20 wasted dollars! I obviously missed that the dvd was in american format. Luckily my son living in USA was home, so I could watch it on his apple-computer. It was also in no way possible to copy and open the film for european standard. Please make clear in the presentation of films if they only could be played in american format. 
 Dio just doesnt have what it takes in this one. The whole band is not in tune with each other.  I was very disappointed in this concert. By the third  song I was ready to turn it off. If I could, I would try and get my money back. Sorry Dio,  And I'm a big fan too 
 I've read a lot of these stand-up books now, about five of them, and this one is far and away the worst.  If you want to know how to sound like a dated, hack comic -- this is your text.  I cannot imagine an evening out being "entertained" by a group of comics that all follow the exercises in this book.  I would hang myself before the night was over.  This book convinces comics to play AWAY from their voice and to simply take banal observations and wrestle them into tired hyperbolic cliche setup-punch format.  Nothing in this book put forward as an example of good comedy made me laugh.  Actually, more often than not they made me cringe.  The book is dated, the lessons will turn your into an unfunny "joke teller."  Do yourself a favor and watch some comedians you find funny and then ask yourself if they are doing anything REMOTELY similar to what this book suggests you need to do to be funny.  You'll be surprised.  I have to say please don't waste your money on this book unless you actually WANT to be a bad, cheesy, stuck-in-the-80s "comedy stylist. 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 I purchased these speakers about a year ago. If you'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example. I'm on Amazon right now buying replacements (ANOTHER BRAND) for these that have completely failed. They worked fine at first, then got fuzzier. One quit completely tonight, no power..nothing. The other still "works" with lots of fuzz. I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot. Time for a replacement. If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand. I'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now. They supposedly have better range. Don't settle for cheap unless you have to. You'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long! Don't say we didn't warn you 
 Politically Incorrect apparently means bigoted, racist, sexist, classist, and freakin' proud of it, woman!  These "guides" are a scary, scary joke written by angry bigots to make open-minded people angry, and to help justify their own prejudices and inablity to let go of the "good old days" when it was considered fitting when a woman got slapped for mouthing off...    What a disgusting view of the world 
 The title is wrong, this item contains twelve .5-Grams (0.0175 ounce) packets, not twelve .5-Ounce packets. 
 Used this unit for a while but complaints about line static by my phone counterparts were consistent and energetic.  Did not use the unit for six months.  Tried to use the unit today after it was sitting safely in a seldom used drawer.  System failed to activate at all.  Tried resetting.  Called the customer service number on back of the unit to see what could be done if anything.  After the phone self-help proved useless (very user unfriendly), I struggled to get out of the "loop".  Finally, reached a voice who put me on hold, came back, and they transferred me to another technician where my call was dropped.  The customer service number on the website sent me into a new self-help h#ll.  I just needed it to work with my dish network.  I am using the recommendation on this site to use the SBC unit.  Save yourself a lot of annoyance and move on 
 I read in this book thay beef is bad to feed your pet,however; when i read deeper the book states that one should feed the pet a beef knuckle as a means of nutrition. BUYER BEWARE 
 I purchased this CD after hearing their latest CD "In All Things", and after seeing them live. The show was spectacular, and their latest cd is quite good. Imagine my disappointment when I realized that this CD would be far more appropriately classified as a CD for christian audiences! Upon realizing this, the CD was forcibly ejected from my player and will never see the light of day, or be spoken of, again. The musicianship was solid, but I feel as though I've been conned. In the mood for secular nouveau celtic? You won't find it here 
 It's a good thing she doesn't use Hebrew writing. On the inside cover, she does for the shehecheyanu prayer, and makes six writing errors in it. She mispronounces often, and makes errors in meaning and word form (mistaking verbs for nouns, etc.). I've spent only a few minutes looking at the book, but found stunningly many and ghastly errors, in addition to very poor translations. Can you imagine, if you know Hebrew, accenting the word "koach" (strength) at the end, instead of the "ko" part. I could add a long list of such items, in spite of the fact that I've only looked at it for a few minutes. It's not only "for" dummies, possibly, but also "of" and "by". I am giving it two stars based on the impression that it could be useful to some folks such as tourists. But don't trust it 
 Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!  The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.  The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.  The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  "How long can this go on without being funny," one asks oneself.  "Surely it will be funny next episode!"  Nothin' doin'.  If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a "funny skit" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.  And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug 
 Ok.  Kyle was the GL in the DC Comic book world for a long time.  He took over for Hal Jordan who decided to take a long needed vacation (ok, he went crazy and killed a whole bunch of people but hey, my version sounds more real then what this novel did).  This novel in one word sucked.  It bastardized the entire origin of Kyle Rayner and how he became a Green Lantern.  It destroyed what happened to Coast City and how it tied into Superman.  It made the Atom seem like a pain in the tucas and the only character that was written correcly was Batman.  Hal is in this but not in a good way.  Kyle is in this and it too is not in a good way.  When did Kyle ever call Ganthet "Gandy"?  And why in the heck did the other Oan's want to remake the universe...wasn't that Hal's job when he became Parallax???  In a nut shell if you like Green Lanter, any version of the character, read the comics and put this book down.  There are much better novels out there to read 
 I thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept.  The first night we used it, my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports.  He was horrified that our son could have suffocated.  This was after I had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits.  I suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move at all 
 I really like Thomas Moore's books but this one was definitely not one of his best. I found it very boring and it was kinda one of those books that just made no sense at all. I found it hard to continue to read the whole book even tho I did... 
 Typical story of the woman who gets dumped by her husband for a more exciting woman.  This one bakes bread to "heal" and meets another guy and Yupee every thing is super again...  
 You can usually rely on Minette Walters for a seminar on criminally disturbed minds. There's some of that in this novel but it's way, way too long. Ms. Walters introduces us to an interesting character in George (female), a councillor trying to unravel a couple of long-ago murders blamed on a young man with mental disabilities. She teams up with a professor with an enormous chip on his shoulder.  The two of them go off investigating and the book bogs down into hypothesis after hypothesis after hypothesis. It just goes on and on. If it hadn't been a Minette Walters book I would have put it down unfinished, but I kept hoping it was going to click into gear. It didn't.  Where was the editor? The book could have been whacked down to about half its length 
 I didn't find this book especially helpful. It seems the author could not decide who her target audience is: is it middle aged women who make $100K a year or 23 year old women making $25K?  I also didn't think the financial advice was nearly as interesting or helpful as books written by finance professionals; the author is a therapist by training.  It also seems that much of the advice is for women who are entirely passive, and I'm not sure most women fall into this category (I certainly do not.)  Save your money 
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 Let me start by saying I am an art student and I only buy these "Art of" books to learn to learn from them. The Art of the Incredibles was a INCREDIBLE let down. This has to be some of ther worse preproduction art I have ever seen. Of  the 3 "Art of" Pixar books, this is definitely the worse 
 I have never read any of his other works so I am finding it incredibly difficult [...].  I forced myself to read 150 pages or so into this book and simply could not go any further.  Whilst some may view the lack of storyline, developed characters and interesting material as a brilliant statement on the state of the "gay world" today, I find it weak.    I may not always agree or like what writers write but if they do it in an engaging and passionate manner I will most certainly read them through to the end.  There was very little that was engaging in this novel.      Regardless of what reviewers have said about his other works I will not be exploring this "cycle" any further 
 Aaron Sisson works in the English mining industry, and is also a talented flortist. Disenchanted with his life, he leaves his wife and children and finds work with an orchestra in London. There, and in Italy, he tries to come to terms with his life and emotions whilst finding new acquaintances in London society and then with Britons in Italy.   The novel centres on Aaron's alienation, his retreat from and aversion to responsibility for others: it is right to stay in a relationship when you are feeling untrue to yourself by doing so? Just what are individuals' responsibilities to each other?   These are familiar Lawrence themes and will come as no surprise to those who have read his other works. It's also very much a novel of its time: pseudo-fascist ideas are in the air - social Darwinism and Nietzschean thought permeate the attitudes of the main characters, especially Lilly.  That being said, this is somewhat second-rate Lawrence. It's a very bitty novel: it was written in haste, sections completed then left for a considerable amount of time. And it reads like that. Few of the characters are convincingly drawn, others appear then disappear without reason and without contributing to the novel in any meaningful way. The strength of the prose is variable, with large sections of the novel stagnating as a result.  One for those interested in reading Lawrence's lesser-known works, but I should imagine a turn-off for those trying him out for the first time.  G Rodger 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)

 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book "fiction" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story. Especially how Grissom is protrayed in whole "hatch" issue. 
 `I'm Just Here For the Food Version 2.0' by Food Network culinary supernerd, Alton Brown is a revision of his James Beard award winning first book. For those who always go to the back of the book to see whodunit, this book is not worth buying if you already own the first edition.  What is surprising is that the thinness of the `improvements' to the book are apparent on the front cover, where we see that this version `includes these special upgrades, - 4 removable refrigerator magnets, -15 brand new recipes'. This does not even merit calling this a significant new edition. It falls far short of the improvements found in Brown's hero, Harold McGee's second edition of `On Food and Cooking'. It is an even bigger disappointment when you compare it to new releases of popular software. My best cases are to compare it to the excellent PC strategy games, `Sid Meier's Civilization' and `Sim City', both of which are now at `Version 4.0'. And, each new release involved a virtually complete redesign with major overhauls of mechanics and features. Merely adding new features to the existing system comes out as a new product, not unlike Volume 2 of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.  The original ended its text on page 287 and Version 2.0 ends on page 321. This gives us 34 new pages or a 12% increase in material. What is surprising is that a large number of these pages are added to the Appendices.  In Version 1.0, the appendices start on page 240. In Version 2.0, the appendices start on page 256, showing that the additions to the main text are nothing more than the 15 new recipes. We will come to these later. The best news about these additions is that a sizable chunk of these 18 pages comes in the Index. I am a big fan of good indices and tables of contents, as I think that they can double or even triple the value of a cookbook. Most of the rest of the additions to the appendix are marginal. Much goes to the touted refrigerator magnets showing the major cuts of meat from cattle, hogs, lamb, and chickens. The diagrams surrounding these doo-dads are a bit better than in Version 1.0, but not nearly as good as you will find in, for example, the Larousse Gastronomique.  As I stated in my review of the original volume, I am a seriously doting fan of Mr. Brown's work, and his recent `Feasting on Asphalt' Food Network miniseries and his contribution as commentator on `Iron Chef America' continue to win my admiration. I firmly believe that AB's voice-over to the cooking are what makes the show as entertaining as it is. If that were gone, the show would sink into mediocrity and disappear. On the other hand, AB has been lured into turning his printed output into something of a brand, very similar to Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything' rubric and Rachael Ray's '30 Minute Meal' mantra. Oddly, of these three, I thing Rachael has given her audience the greatest value per title.  I thought Alton's second volume was almost pure rip-off, and this volume is very close to being the same kind of exploitation of his audience. AB redeemed himself with his fourth and fifth titles, which I believe are superb services to amateur cooks and bakers.  My biggest single surprise in this Version 2.0 is the fact that there seemed to be no effort whatsoever to fix the `bugs' in the original text. The most obvious type of `bug' was misspellings. I may be able to forgive misspelling the famous plastic model making brand, Revel, but I have a harder time forgiving the use of an archaic and unfamiliar name, `cimeter' for a type of knife much more commonly know as a `scimitar' (OK, so `cimeter' IS in my Webster's Unabridged 3rd Edition, but AB's use is really annoying, when the more common spelling is so much more familiar).  Before I get into the additional recipes, I must say that in spite of how much I like AB's explanations of food science and technique, I virtually never use any of his recipes. If Alton and Mario Batali or Bobby Flay or Jacques Pepin or Nick Malgieri or James Peterson gave me conflicting information, I would use the advice from the professional chef or professional teacher over AB's suggestion or recipe. That's because, as Daniel Boulud has so clearly stated, the thing which separates the amateur from the professional is the fact that the professional has made the same dish a thousand times over, so that all the inefficiencies in his method have been worn off, leaving the essence of good method. And, in the case of professional teachers Malgieri and Peterson, they have studied the professionals, so their advice is as good or better than the practitioner.  Regarding the recipes, I think it is poor form that Alton did not highlight the new ones in his table of contents; however, if you happen to own both Version 1.0 and Version 2.0, you can easily find the new recipes by laying out the tables of contents side by side and locate the additions. And, I find that some of the new recipes are a waste of time. While I don't actually make AB's recipes, I generally find them, especially on his `Good Eats' show, to be excellent illustrations of his points. In this book, some of the new recipes do nothing to advance our understanding of his cooking principles. The `Roasted Tomato Soup' is a perfect example, as the recipe involves no roasting! It uses roasted tomatoes from the previous recipe, giving us no illumination on roasting technique (and, I think Ina Garten's roasted tomato soup is better).  If you own Version 1.0, stay away from this new edition. It is clearly not worth an additional $32.50! If it were not for AB's autograph in my Version 1.0, I would give it away. 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 Mr. Blake and Mr. Bly are the "Killer B's" when it comes to encouraging creativity in ads.  They recommend holding the status quo and not rocking the creative boat.  Safe advice, but hardly inspiring to a  newbie in the copywriting field.  Follow their beat and you might wind up  like the rats in "The Pied Piper".  Better to read Luke  Sullivan's book "Squeeze This Whipple" to get your juices flowing  instead of risking creative clots with this 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 I purchased this book for an overview of Acrobat 6.0. While there is some good info, too much is not explained fully. There are constant cross references "see chapter 8", no page reference and the bulk of the book is for the pro version. The author spends a lot of time using fancy nomenclature (not technical terms) instead of offering better tips. I would love to see a Special Edition Using Acrobat from Que Publishing. That series is excellent for learning software. I will look for a better book. 
 This film is laughably bad. The entire plot is completely unrealistic and it is difficult to have any sympathy for the cruel murderer who is central to the plot, who is not only a murderer but also totally retarded, missing numerous opportunities to escape and make life easier for himself and the saps who for some random reason have taken it upon themselves to look after him. This film is an absolute waste of time, but feel free to watch it if you feel like wasting 107 minutes of your life 
 I found it a disappointment. None of the songs are worth listening to more than once (i.e., anything special) except the cover of Tears for Fears' "Mad World," seemingly thrown in there amongst all the rest to break its boredom. The other songs are not insightful or to my liking. It's definitely not a CD worth buying (and I'm glad I didn't). 
 I purchased this book hoping for an objective, scholarly history of the life of Mary Magdalene.  However, this book is little more than an assortment of personal attacks on the beliefs of Christianity and the Catholic Church cleverly marketed as a biography.  In typical propaganda-slinging fashion, she paraphrases and condemns writings, events and individuals that go against her personal views while accepting and embracing those that support her beliefs.  While Ms. Picknett clearly conducted a large amount of research, she obviously has many deep personal issues with the church that would be better sorted out through counseling and therapy rather than through the publishing of books.  She condemns the Catholic Church for the (unfortunately) many bad practices of the past without really acknowledging all the good work and teachings done by the vast majority of its members throughout history.  This is analagous with tearing down the entire present-day educational system because of some bad teachers that were around centuries ago.  She certainly needs to learn how to distinguish between occasional faulty leadership versus a faulty organization.  A few bad apples do not always spoil the whole bunch.  This discrete "it's either all good or all bad" line of thinking, coupled with the one-sided iconoclastic attempts to destroy the image of Jesus, are pathetic at best and have no place in any text aimed at those seeking to make up their own minds through an objective presentation of facts 
 More a story about the author than the subject, ignore Sinclair's part.  This book is actually a projection of Rachel Lichtenstein's search for a particular type of Eastern European, Jewish past. It begins with a tale of an room, undisturbed since its solitary occupier - the Rodinsky of the title - mysteriously abandoned it in the late 1960's.  Rachel Lichtestein begins the tale by trying to rediscover her Jewish origins, and discovers Rodinsky's abandoned room above a desolate synagogue in a part of the East End of London which was a Jewish area in the first half of the Twentieth Century.  	While the narrative moves along Rachel's attempts to find out more about the life and circumstances of Rodinsky, however it becomes clear that she is overtaken by her imaginings and projects her increasing interest in cabbalistic thought and Jewish mysticism.  Her search in London is rather mundane, however the book comes alive when she travels to Poland to visit abandoned Jewish villages in the borderlands of the present-day Poland and Ukraine. It was from this area that a significant number of the East End Jews arrived, following pograms in the late 19th Century. The impact of the devastation of the Second World War and the Nazi genocide is still palpable in the area, especially to Rachel and her companions.  There are interesting insights into the devastated  folk culture, in particular the Golem - a fictitious, menacing ogre, and the lamed vavnika, a collection of righteous, learned men, whose identities are secret. Their presence and their anonymity, prevent the world from being destroyed.  It's a highly evocative tale of vengeful Deities, secrecy and scholarship. Rachel associates this with Rodinsky's fevered,multilingual note taking, and this is where the story  is at its  most tenuous.   	The balance of the story is a straight-forward description of the twists and turns involved in Rachel's quest to piece together Rodinsky's last movements and, finally, his last resting place. Her motivation is to offer a prayer - Kaddish - over his grave, as she has done for others in Eastern Poland, is very moving.  Usually Kaddish is offered by the deceased's next-of-kin, however both Rodinsky and the victims of genocide had no one to pray for them and Rachel feels the weight of this desolation. The book can be very deflating in terms of the cycle of woe which befalls the Jews - the Polish pograms of the 1890's, the genocide of the Second World War,  and there are mentions of subsequent anti-Semitism in Poland of the 1960s.   There is a hopelessness about the fate of the Jews in the storytelling which is belied by the energy of the storyteller in her research and in her real life.  This does not gel with my experience of Israel/Palestine, which I know to be a highly energetic, cosmopolitan, diverse and troubled society, whose energy is its most appealing characteristic.  That being said, the part of the story told by Rachel, while being somewhat incredible, is sincere and well told.  	Have you ever experienced a bore at a funeral? Someone who is so intent on telling his/her own story with only glancing references to the deceased?  For a reason, which is inexplicable to me, the story of Rachel's quest is periodically interrupted by irrelevant chapters by Iain Sinclair which completely break the flow of the narrative.  He mentions `waiting for Godot', Bob Geldof, Harold Pinter, his own writings, the writing of some of his obscure friends, other Jewish legends, other people who are dead or missing - all tangentially related to Rodinsky or Rachel. Why? Sinclair shows up at the launch of the book and its readings, but he does not carry or contribute to the story.  I can only surmise that Rachel was not confidant in her abilities to get the book started without him, but surely an experience editor should have intervened at some point in the books creation and dropped Sinclair;s contribution.  As it is, the book can be quite usefully understood without bothering with Sinclair's pieces - indeed each chapter's author is listed, so perhaps the editor is making some effort at guiding us through the dross.  	Through Rachel's recounting of the story, it is obvious that the room, abandoned by Rodinsky in the 1960's, has been used as a powerful metaphor by both writers and photographers since it's `rediscovery' in the 1980's. It becomes clear from the photographs of the room that various photographs have rearranged the `undisturbed' room to fit their own needs for a story over the years.  I think Rachel is also guilty of the same transference, it is possible that Rodinsky saw himself as an autodictat, in splendid isolation or it may be that he was a disturbed, isolated and frightened man who lived and died in extreme poverty and loneliness.  Once it becomes clear that  Rodinsky's actual personality and possessions are not knowable at this remove, the story could have focussed more on the social life of the Jewish area of the East End, the story could have included social progression, increasing affluence and assimilation; instead I believe the narrative explores Jewish tragedy and isolation, the necessity to acquire and disseminate knowledge so as to leave a record which may survive the inevitable disasters that will be visited upon the population.  
 Umberto Lenzi's most notorious entry into the "Italian Cannibal" subgenre is a contender with Cannibal Holocaust with the most bloodshed. Whereas Cannibal Holocaust was a well made exploitation film, Ferox is just a standard Euro-trash film laden with shocking gore moments. A student travels into the deep Amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed. They of course find evidence to prove this wrong. Our characters meet up with two criminals (tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in New York City) who, guilty by association, get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe. As usual, in poor taste, there are some real animal killings. Most of the music was taken from Umerto Lenzi's previous cannibal film Eaten Alive! 
 Disordered Minds was a confusing, dull and overly opinionated novel.  I normally read books quickly, even if they're bad, but even I could barely find enough motivation to finish this book in less than a month.  The biggest mistake at the beginning was the inclusion of a huge extract from a book written by one of the main characters, Dr. Jonathon Hughes.  Although this extract gave us all the details about the murder that was to be investigated, it was long-winded and lacked any trace of excitement or `hook' for the reader.  Dr. Jonathon Hughes and Councillor George Gardiner (female) started out as the main characters.  They were definitely an interesting pair and the book picked up a bit at this point although a few of their character details were ridiculous.  I literally shuddered when George said that the reason why she had never married was because she had never found a man as good as her father - it seemed completely stereotypical.  As the middle of the book approached the prose was weighed down by continually going over and over again and again and again the same period when a young girl called Cill was raped.  It was incredibly dull and boring and other characters such as Louise Burton, a.k.a Daisy, a.k.a. Priscilla Fletcher, filled up so much space and time that George and Jonathon were neglected and barely mentioned again apart from a few e-mails and presence in the final chapters.   As Howard, the person they were trying to clear of murder was already dead, there was very little emotional involvement for the reader, as he couldn't be properly vindicated anyway.  As I counted the pages down and the ending loomed near I kept on thinking that surely a twist must occur, surely SOMETHING of interest must happen to have justified the torture of reading this book.  But no, the ending was like a damp squib at a fireworks display, devoid of any real tension or excitement.  The budding relationship between Jonathon and a woman was comical and there was no payback for the reader.  Guilty parties were left unpunished.  Overall Disordered Minds is probably the worst of Walter's books.  I don't mean to be cruel as I absolutely adore The Ice House, The Dark Room and a lot of the others but this book just didn't work for me.  I also hate all the e-mails and witness statements and extracts thrown into the book as they just break up the story and slow the pace and tension down.  JoAnn 
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen as complainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa- triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,  who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),  who gets wake up call while trying to charm  the pants (literally) off John Goodman's real  life wife! He meets his match and learns a few  things along the way. All-American Steve's get looked up to in here; especially Steve McGar- rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort of dull film would get two star rating from moi 
 It seems every book on evolution nowdays spouts a new version of how we got here.  This book is no different.  What the authors are doing here is obvious: Because life is adaptive and evolves purposefully, these guys are trying to construct this reality onto a foundation of accidents. It's a truly laughable premise that is so funny it almost hurts.  This book is almost worthless.  If this book were a political persuasion it would vote "moderate."  And it's absolutely a joke that any book written on evolution would leave out a detailed discussion of subjects such as epigenetics, horizontal gene transfer, and environmentally-induced gene expression. The last of which touched on in this book, but only fleatingly.  This book is good for one thing: taking neo-darwinism one step closer to the trashcan where it belongs.  This is one last attempt to save a dying theory 
 This "handbook" presents an extremely simple and narrow look at Chinese horoscopes. It might be lots of fun at parties, but don't expect to get a detailed horoscope from it.  Anyone really familiar with Western horoscopes will know "Heaven Knows What" by Grant Lewi. I use that as my point of comparison for any book on astrology. Lewi's work has a flaw in that it fails to deliver any technique that can be used outside of his system and doesn't illustrate much of the mechanics of astrological study, yet with his book newcomers are able to produce very detailed horoscopes that compare well to the most advanced techniques of aficionados.  How does Lau's work compare to Lewi's book? Not well at all. As with Lewi, Lau's work falls short on technique, but her book also doesn't produce results. Lau's work is simple and disgustingly "correct." It is never at all challenging, negative or critical. Where Lewi's work demonstrates artistry and deep compelling knowledge with clear, detailed and personal descriptions, Lau offers no more than bland pleasant entertainment.  You might think that a book of 400+ pages would have to have quite a bit of useful content, but you'd be wrong. Most of the book is filled with the same descriptions repeated over and over again with slight variation for each sign. It's as much a substantive handbook as a CPR poster is a physician's desk reference.  You can learn very little from this book. You can learn the birth years for each sign and some general characteristics and compatibility between the signs. All of that information is available for free on Chinese restaurant placemats. This book will not teach you anything about the mechanics of Chinese astrology, nor will you learn anything deep or insightful about anyone with it.  Even though it's very simple, I don't think that this is a very good book for a beginner who wants to progress with Chinese astrology. It's an incredibly superficial glimpse of a complex and beautiful philosophy that will leave a real seeker disquieted and unfulfilled.  One more valuable bit of information: The charts in this book do not extend very far into the future. If you rely on it to any extent, you'll have to pick up another copy every few years. Other books offer decades of charts. This is pure shameless exploitation 
 This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially "I Will Fear No Evil" and "Time Enough for Love." I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with "Job"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty 
 Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad 
 Although this book contains 27 house plans, in my opinion only a very small percentage of these are innovative enough to warrant publishing. The most exciting being the design by Earth Rammed Works which could have  easily taken over the whole book and I wished it had.! Some of the designs  used new  energy saving materials such as photovoltaics, but these were not  given explanation space and left the reader feeling quite frustrated 
 We bought this humidifier as the low-cost alternative when our kids were sick this week.  It's horrible!  We're returning it today!  When this unit is running, it leaks water between the reservoir and motor units.  Overnight it leaked enough water to completely saturate a folded up large bath towel I placed under it!  Two days later & the towel is still wet!  Additionally, the unit is noisy, spits out water droplets with the mist, and is very difficult to clean (oddly shaped water reservoir makes it impossible to completely empty the unit).  If you need a humidifier, buy a different product 
 It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances.  
 I felt that this book really failed to bring any substantive arguments to the table.  It is replete with British cynicism that ironically reinforces the gap between "high" and "low" culture that it purports to condemn.  The examples he uses to support his claims are frequently taken out of context and ultimately do little to further his arguments.  Simply put, this work reflects poor rhetoric and therefore rides the coat-tails of scienece and cultural anthropology to furnish his points (cultural anthropology, by the way, he presents as science; i.e. - as objective truth.  God knows a cultural scientist brings no subjectivity into the process. *note my sarcasm*).  In the end, I just disagree with him, but should also add, his efforts (which seem to me to be quite derivative) do very little to even move me to consider his theses 
 We bought the PetSafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much.  It is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 Maltese.  This particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won't work.  Unfortunately, because it's rigid, it slides up a dog's neck very easily.  I have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can't slide.  Even when I can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides, it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position.  A shrug, a shake, or simply walking a few steps is all it takes.  This is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs, is not going to work.  It should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight, it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member, this is NOT a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems.  The dog now has another negative association to the person.  Consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying. F. Quall 
 While the movie (for my niece and nephew,) was mildly amusing, it seemed to be a rip off of ideas from the "Tick" cartoon series, set in a high school.  The soundtrack- terrible! Why can't they leave the songs alone. I detest covers and remakes. The original artist inteneded it to be recorded the way they did. They did not intend to have some 20-something rocker wanna-bes butchering their vision. Were you really amused, or was your stomach churning, hearing these lame covers?   And why would high school kids be listening to 20+ year old music anyway. My niece and nephew were complaining that they didn't know any of the songs...  The only song worth listening to is the "They Might Be Giants" tune- finally something original on this CD!  Sorry if you are offended, but it had to be said- this is still America, where I can freely state my opinions and thoughts (especially when I am invited to give it in an open forum! 
 First of all, I just need to state that "Odd Thomas" is one of my favorite novels ever.  That said, "Forever Odd" was a pretty big letdown.  It lacked much of the intrigue of the first one, which is what I was expecting.  By the end of "Odd Thomas", you pretty much know all of Odd's secrets and clear portrait is painted.  I had a feeling that Koontz would not be able to do this novel the same way, and I was correct.  What bothered me the most about this book was that it had little to do with Odd Thomas.  If you cut out the first few chapters, last few chapters and change the names of the characters, you would have a book that would not even remotley remind a reader of "Odd Thomas".  In fact, I think that Koontz probably should have done just that.  If he had taken the plot out of the Odd Thomas universe and developed a stronger relationship between the main character and Datura, it would have made a good story.  I also felt that a good third of this book was nothing but space filler with Koontz describing Odd wandering through complicated water drainage systems and a burned out hotel/casino.  I thought the last three chapters of the book were amazing, but it didn't make up for the less than satisfactory sixty chapters I had to read to get there 
 Superb opening to this movie with some excellent and brutal action scenes / effects involving crime on the streets of Italy. One very memorable signature tune / song is the only other stand out in what amounts to a fairly average movie once the credits have rolled. There is some impressive stunt work by Franco Nero and his co-stars, but none of it tops the film's opening and the final climax is an anti-climax. There is some fun to be had watching Franco Nero over-act especially when he takes a beating in a muddy puddle, but otherwise I found this film to be just average, Barbara Bach is wasted in this. Blue Underground have delivered their usual high standard DVD treatment, with only a few frames looking a bit rough. As a long term fan of this great DVD company I can't help thinking they could be working their magic on more interesting and sought after genre fair than this movie, perhaps The Big Racket and Heroin Busters will make more of an impression on me 
 I found this book pedantic. Was there really a need for so many 5 syllable, grab the dictionary words when Mr. Mamet's stream of consciousness monologue is difficult to follow anyway? I felt no empathy  because I found no attempt to relate to or touch upon humanity. 
 Last night I listened to the whole CD on Clear Channel.  (Everyone should deliberately hold off on buying a disc until they hear every song or at least a sample of every song.  It will definitely save you time and money.)  I was sorely disappointed.  There were only three songs on that disc that really resonated with me.  Once In A Lifetime, I Told You So, and Got It Right This Time.  God Made Woman was God awful.  Richard Marx had attested that Everybody rose above Better Life in quality, but I think it was lackluster in relation to Better Life.  Sorry Richard Marx fans, but this song was more Marx than Urban.  Not in a good way either.  The rest of the songs were drowned in heavy production, bland melodies, needless bridges, and repetitive lyrics.  I really expected more from Keith.  I was hoping for more guitar, rather than keyboard and piano.  I was also expecting it to sound like country, instead of saccharine laden pop.  I'm going to stick with iTunes for the tracks I do like and leave the rest by the wayside.  I'm not paying for the whole disc.  I wouldn't want anyone to have to pay full price for this record.     Music is an experimental business, much like movie making or any other type of media art.  It's a gamble really.  Sometimes you can release the best disc of your career.  An album that has one hit after another, with unlimited radio and television airplay.  Then sometimes you can release a dud.  I'm sure in Keith Urban's case, that dud will still earn him a multi-platinum CD, along with all the acoutrements of a "quality" record.  He has a hardcore mob of fans that will love anything that Urban produces, much like Richard Marx. Of course, these days, Urban beats Marx in sales of his own discs, but both artists stay in the same realm of revenue as far as being accomplished songwriters.  You can't dispute the fact that both musicians are very talented in that area.  I have to watch my words though, or some of the fans may want to verbally break my legs when I mention anything less than a perfect review of either Marx or Urban.  LOL!  (Sometimes there is no way to verbalize something so ridiculously funny.  So chatspeak has to suffice.)  Does this mean there is no accounting for taste?  Maybe.  After I wrote this review, I read similar reviews in the Boston Globe, and the Daily News.  You have to look at reviews objectively, but I think that I'm not the only one who sees the flaws.  Yet there is a contrast to those poor reviews.  Billboard, one of the most influential music publications in the world, gave it a rave review.  They said that, "it was fitting that (Keith Urban) ended the record with Got It Right This Time."  Now don't get all upset.  I still love the majority of Mr. Urban's catalogue.  (Marx's too!)  Putting aside the fact that I am a big fan of his work, I just think that Keith Urban's record went too far away from country.  Hopefully any good and bad reviews that he receives from this effort will help in the creation of his next disc.    (You may wonder why I included Richard Marx in relation to this subject, aside from the obvious connection.  From what I have observed, most of the fans that like Marx are diehard Urban fans.  Just like Rodney Crowell fans will tend to listen to Keith Urban, or the same would hold true for Dann Huff.  You connect the relative to prove your point.)  
 I couldn't read past the second chapter.  Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.  It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".  "Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.  I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks.  
 In ordering the PACKAGE for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy by Gerald Corey, I entered the ISBN # for the PACKAGE. I had declined several options for the HARDCOVER ONLY because I wanted the PACKAGE including the Student Manual.  I received the shipment in a fairly timely manner. HOWEVER, I was only sent the HARDCOVER!  I paid $10 more than I could have gotten that single book for locally right across the street from my college!  I ended up having to order the manual separately from another seller.   I was unable to contact seller because name given did not match what was on the shipment.  My serenity is worth more than a $10 fight!  I would not use this seller again 
 I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better 
 Although I was excited about this book, I was not very pleased with the style with which it was written or the content.  Ms. Ezell seems to have some very quick solutions to very difficult life problems.  The book itself proports to address the very real problem of women who are discontented with their life, who have wishful thinking about what the want and who they are with, but proposes to address those concerns in a little over one hundred pages.   In the chapter on forgiveness, Ms. Ezell counsels you to look in the mirror and say I forgive.  Although she warns us against "magical" thinking, she seems to be using it herself.  She contradicts herself.  Her bible quotes seem self-serving and her reference to "humanists" seems to infer an intolerance to different faiths and opinions.  She tells us that we should trust God to give us what we need, but then says that everything in life is not planned, some circumstances just happen!  I was pretty dissappointed, to say the least and I have a magical feeling that I was not the only one 
 i bought this album one day and i regret it SO bad, i mean i wasted 17 bucks on the lamest cd i could ever buy. take my word for it, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!!!!! 
 I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.  The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.    First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.    Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.    
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 We all know that O.J. Simpson is 1000% guilty of this horrific double-murder and that he was able to buy justice thanks to his shameless "Dream Team" lawyers (or liars) and their utterly despicable tactics. Despite the countless lies found here, what I find most offensive, nasty and sickening is how Simpson refers to himself as being a "battered husband"--Say What???!!! Lies, more lies and nothing but big, nasty and fat lies 
 I thought Colin was sleeping at first. I didn't realize he was "acting sensitive".  It would be more interesting to watch paint dry, than this slow, boring, pointless movie.  So, his friend is gay, big suprise, and Colin movies to New York to live with him and kooky girl.  Who ever thought Robin Wright could look ugly?  She used to be an attractive girl, I guess living with Sean Penn must be very stressful.  You probably guessed the plot - kooky girl really loves gay friend, but Colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the "unconventional life" thats even more boring than living in the "burbs".  They are the most conventional "unconventional" bores of all time.  Either overdose on black coffee or skip this one.  For extreme Colin fans only.  Enjoy!  
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 This book relates the details of the life of Gerry Spence, a well-known trial lawyer.  From his earliest days of life through the beginnings of his second marriage, Spence reveals to us what his life was like, who his influences were, and how he reacted.  The driving focus of the book is Spence's mother, who took her own life when he was a young man.  At the time of her death, she and Spence had had a falling out, and Spence sees much of the rest of his life as trying to make peace with her.  At the end of this book, some of Spence's famous cases and clients are mentioned in an epilogue; however, these topics are not discussed in the memoir section at all.  As an outsider to Spence's family, this book was extremely hard to get through.  Some of the details of his early life in rural Wyoming were quite interesting, and he certainly reveals some of his character as he variously compares arguing in the courtroom to wild game hunting or playing poker.  The stories of his first marriage and its breakup, and how he took up with another woman are not exactly things to be proud of, and I'm not sure his family would really want to see these details published.  When his marriage was on the rocks, he decided to sell his family's home in Wyoming together with all their possessions and start life anew in Mill Valley, California.  Within a month, though, he abandoned his family in Mill Valley, where they were far from relatives, friends or any other people who might provide emotional support, to go back to his mistress in Wyoming.  I couldn't help thinking about Judith Wallerstein's book about children of divorce ("Second Chances") when I read this section.  For her studies, she chose families facing divorce in the early 1970s living in a town in California.  Was it Mill Valley where she did her studies?  Did she include the four Spence children in her work?  Was it the Spence children whose standard of living took a drastic nosedive when their father moved in with someone else?  But it was the woe begotten prose addressed to Spence's mother that was the most difficult part of this book to get through.  I had hoped to develop some sympathy for lawyers, or at least for this one, or maybe even learn something about growing up in the West during the Depression by reading this book.  Instead, after reading this book, I find myself repelled even by the thought of reading any more memoirs by lawyers. 
 Nothing here but a load of chords. Try one of those "how to play from fake books", or the "pop piano book" to learn real ideas on rhythm and filling in. We middling pianists need some concrete ideas on how to accompany or fill in, let's say "Candle in the wind"!  Waste of mone 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.  Not only did it lack in technical medical information, but I found it to be harsh and unsupportive.  The author's attempt at humor was, to me, offensive and harsh.   If you are looking for the medical technical side of infertility, pick up Dr. Sherman Silbers book.  If you are looking for lighthearted emotional support with excellent tips and coping tools, pick up IVF The Wayward Stork. Save your money on this one. 
 This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.     The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.   
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 After reading several pages of this book I encountered a gross insult to the President.  This after other negative references to conservatives.  Fine.  I chose to return the book and exchange it for a copy of Mark Steyn's America Alone.  Mr. Ford, go sit with the Dixie Chicks 
 We are raising our son trilingual according to the most recent developments in this areas.  If you are to raise them bilingual as mother speakers then there has to be clear definations between each of the languages.  In other words, do not mix the languages.  I thought that this cd would have songs in Spanish and then the same song in English.  However, verses and words are mixed all the time.  Being trilingual myself, I found this to be very confusing and against the rules of raising multilingual children 
 Another reviewer mentioned this already, but there is sex with animals.  Most of the lesbian stories involved women being turned on by dogs or donkeys.  I was pretty disappointed.  I didn't give it 1 star, because I appreciated the work that went into collecting the stories.  It was written in the 70s, so maybe that had something to do with the tone 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 they can take down big paulie but they can't save our crumbling country from their treasonous higher-ups. when i buy a mafia book i prefer to read about the mafia, not about the boring ass cops. its like 75% feds, 25% mob. don't read unless you're interested in the fbi. its not a true mafia boo 
 When I ordered this book, I was expecting something along the line of high protein, low carb meals with no more than 9-15 grams of fat per serving.  I was disappointed to find that a majority of what the book was recommending was 28+ grams of fat per serving.  I commend anyone that has lost 60 pounds on a diet, as I have lost over 100 pounds myself, but if you are wanting to look like a model from a fitness magazine, I don't think you will achieve such results on this particular diet. It does,  however have some neat suggestions that you could modify to a lower fat version, and could be a very good diet plan if your doctor has told you that carbs are causing medical problems for you 
 Hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on Fox news time after time. Move over OReilly 
 I wish I could give them -5 stars. I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $170 should be really good. I couldn't be more wrong. The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day!!! Stay away at all cost 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the 10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products 
 I found this set of flatware to be to light weight for my taste.  Would be ok for a beach cabin or camping set 
 I liked the first Green Day work - it was original, a bit too punky and whitetrash for me, but decent to listen too.  After dropping VERY large money for the last two albums I realized I was buying the same music just repackaged.  Even the Live versions on Foot In mouth sound exactly the same.  Save your money; either buy one of the first 2-3 albums of theirs or better yet, try something new 
 for the price of the rebate, it is a good deal. Though don't expect you get an easy use of the case, especially all 96 discs are in case. With a big force to squeeze the case together, finally able to zip it, and you will get probably all the disc bent especially the outer sleeve ones It is a bad design by having the same dimesion sleeves sew together in the center. Probably having 48 discs case would be more proper instead of 96 disc 
 I own all the Metheny releases, even Zero Tolerance.  I like his jazz stuff when I can enjoy his guitar expertise and unique melodic phrasing.  This CD doesn't offer much of that.    Make sure you're into hardcore space jazz before you order it up.  If you are, you might love it.  If not, you'll be disappointed 
 very poor design..would never recommend this product. The connection is so flaky,you will end up wasting lot of time 
 To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state.  His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible.  He bases most of it off the perverted  works of "Progressive" historians, among them Charles A. Beard,  whose "Economic Origins" serves as the main basis of his  commentary on the Constitution.  Together with his mistaken history, he  also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory.   Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem  the book somewhat.  I would recommend the work as a source of strong  libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the  difference between the state and government).  However, I would suggest  that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with  those of historians as  BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl  Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis 
 If Hillary's a cult leader, then where's her cult? Because I'm one of the ones Rush, Hannity, Coulter and the rest would have you believe are scheming in the shadows for Hillary's overthrow of apple pie, baseball, and mothers.  I'm one of the wingnuttiest of the wingnuts (or is that "moonbattiest" of the "moonbats?" I get all of these childish epithets confused).  And as wingbatty as I am, I can't stand her.  I understand (disagree with, but understand) the suspicion of Soros.  Big money colluding behind closed doors with influential and powerful politicians.  But this isn't a liberal conspiracy; if you'll just read a gosh darn newspaper, you'll find it's a conservative reality (KBR, the Northern Mariana Islands, seriously, look 'em up).   What I don't understand is how Hillary has achieved boogeyman status.  Like I said, I'm one of the supposed leftist zombies you've been warned about and I'm far from alone in my distaste for and distrust of Hillary.  The only people whispering conspiratorially of Hillary's agenda or even her political potential are conservative pundits and their devotees.  She hardly comes up during our zombie get togethers, and when she does, it's negative as often as not.  Indeed, do you remember her tepid reception at the Coretta Scott King funeral, even with Bill by her side? There you go.  And do you also remember what happened to Lieberman in Connecticut? That's Hillary's future.  We don't like opportunistic, sleazy career politicians any more than you do.  
 There's plenty of raw energy here, and this would have made a good 50-100 page novella.  Alas, it's 350 pages long! The astonishingly randy protagonists make love three or four times a day, and we hear about it every time, along with what they have for breakfast, how they get dressed (and undressed), etc., etc., etc. The style can be most charitably described as pedestrian.  Sample sentence: "They quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher and zoomed to the theater in Scott's vehicle". And the book (self-published) is full of errors of grammar and spelling.  Annoyingly, this is really just the first half of a book: several themes are introduced (coming out to family and classmates, the homophobic Joe) which apparently get resolved in the so-called sequel, which is really the second half of this book. Maybe I'm just an old grouch.... late teen readers may enjoy this book (and quite a few did, judging from the reviews), but you can do better elsewhere 
 This season was poorly written and the acting was awful, don't waste your money on it 
 I was just before ordering as I had not read this one, only to find out that it was two old novels in same cover.  It pays to check Amazon reviews.  I would have been miffed if I had bought it.  I usually read them just as soon as they are published.   Beware of strange marketing practices. 
 I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?! 
 Unlike most of the reviewers I found this book on the boring side. I think it could have been half the length, too. A lot of it was unnecessary and should have been edited better. I enjoyed The House Of Scorpion, but not this one. This book was average, nothing special and written with a lot of passive voice.  It wasn't unique. It read like many other similar books. 
 ...for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink.  Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke.  I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products 
 When I was a boy I rented out this version of Peter Pan from the library and hated it. It was boring and stupid. DON'T EVER SEE THIS VERSION-IT STINKS!  PS. Why make a women play Peter Pan NO AFENCE KATHY RIGB 
 First of all, I AM a Barry Manilow fan.  When I heard that a new Christmas album was coming out in 2002, I was excited.  After his first Christmas album, Because It's Christmas, which was an excellent album, I couldn't wait to buy this one and hear it. What a disappointment.  Only 11 songs, most of them shorter than 3 minutes, some not even 2 minutes long.  There's not a standout song on the entire album.  Better luck next time, Barry 
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.    Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
 This was a complete disappointment. They reduced the size of the book from 8 ½" by 11" to 7" by 10". This in itself is not so bad, but they reduced all the information in this book as well. They no longer cover any antique toys at best they only deal in vintage / classic toys. If your ideas of antique toy cars are Red Line Hotwheels you will like this book.

 As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.  What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.  Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes. In the meantime, here's the Bravo 100 Best Comedies list:  100. Anchorman  99. The Birdcage  98. School of Rock  97. Happy Gilmore  96. Four Weddings and a Funeral  95.

 I read this book with interest wondering how this writer would justify the obvious lack of ethics inherent in taking work away from his fellow citizens and placing work in a third world country.  The answer is that he didn't.  He didn't convince me that outsourcing is either good or inevitable either.  But I am sure he doesn't lose one minute of sleep about the people he's put out of work or the fees he earns doing it.  He'll only start to worry when he is denied fees because Indian nationals take over his activities.    I'm just sorry I contributed to his shameful earnings by buying the book.   
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 I'm almost half-way through this book now, and find it's increasingly becoming more of a struggle for me to keep going back and reading more.  Most of the book is a blow-by-blow (sometimes literally) account of the author's swinging experiences, with some comments about how he and his partner felt about the experiences thrown in.  Anytime I read I find myself quickly becoming bored due to the sameness of the descriptions of their experiences, and getting really irritated with the author's habit of ending every other sentence with an exclamation mark!  There is a serious need for a skilled editor here!  See what I mean!  I'm no psychologist, and maybe I'm just envious, but the author also seems to spend a lot of time and effort describing in repetitious detail his own (and his partner's) insatiable sexual appetites.  How many times do I need a description of how much she squirts, how many times he humps in an evening, how big and hard he gets, and how often they make love when by themselves, including seemingly mandatory descriptions of their yells upon cumming and of course more exclamation marks!?  I can enjoy and get off on good written porn, but this is not it.  I've had a lot of swinging experiences myself, so I do know what it is like, and can identify with most of the author's experiences.  On the other hand, I think they could be communicated in a much more skilled manner by another author.  The more I read, the more I feel ripped off by the(...)price.  All in all, I'm sorry I bought the book.  There are other books and DVDs that do a much better job describing swinging experiences and emotions 
 ive read dozens of reviews for this book.  the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place.  they are all FALSE! this book is BORING.  i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series.  other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category.  ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far.  the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to "make it rain" or "make the statues talk". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman.  this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish.  for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended.  i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish.  its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair.  if you want real fantasy, try something else. please. 
    Just as in his book on Orson Welles, Thomson harbors an untoward lust to "get into the act" himself.  He is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen.      He apparently fancies himself a philosopher, so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento:   "In America we treasure shared things, as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered."  "Here, by the way, is a profound contradiction in much of Americana..."etc     He is, unsurprisingly, cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with "To be quick about this part of it, the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and in its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal."    HUAC's "campaign" itself sadly passed muster via  Congress' power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on, or grandstand about.  It was the methods that offended. HUAC "punishment" was indictment for contempt of congress. The judiciary did the rest on that score, dutifully seeing several into the slam. The blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of The (frightened) Studios.     Worst of all about this book is that, whenever he runs out of cheap, scurrilous, time-hallowed, dirt to re-publish, Thomson concocts bitchy dish "nouveau" of his own to serve up 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the "Ultimate Collection". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free 
 I totally agree with the "reader from Kansas" on 7/18/99. I give this one star to bring down the overall rating. This reader's statement that the last 50 pages were somewhat interesting, and that the reader kept waiting for something to happen, are also true. I read this because I like the author, and I kept on because of the reputation of the author, but there is no tension, twists, etc to this story. It just goes on..and on..and on..The problem is that it is described as an espionage thriller, and it's not. It might be good if reviewed within another genre, but not this one 
 My 4 year old daughter had no fear at nighttime until this book was read in preschool. Now she wakes at night and tells us that there are nightmares in her closet. We tell her that it was only a story and that stories aren't all real, but that doesn't take away the basic idea she is developing about things happening while we (mom and dad included) sleep. Fancy telling us that once the boy has dealt with one monster, another is lurking. It implies an endless stream of nightmares waiting to happen... 
 Readers who are interested in finding out why the West has been targeted by some extremist Muslims as well as why so much anti-western sentiment exists in not only the Islamic world but the developing world at large (and more recently almost the entire world) would be better off reading the works of Edward Said - an Arab Christian who was a true scholar of Middle Eastern and European/American history and documented in several of his works many of the reasons the West is not held in high esteem - and with good reason as anyone would understand if they were on the receiving end (if you are not on the receiving end thank God or your lucky stars whatever works for you).   Mark Gabriel's book is a sad story about a man who experienced persecution that should never have happened, however, it does nothing to help the reader understand the true roots of anti-western sentiment, or the violence perpetrated by a small number of Muslim extremists. I can understand his bitterness given his experiences. However, given his negative experiences and his rejection of Islam personally it is reasonable to infer (as the book demonstrates) that his views of Islam and its history are quite tainted. This book provides the reader with nothing but a very biased and stereotypical account of Islam and its history - IT WILL NOT HELP ANY WESTERNER UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES THAT EXIST IN THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY.  By the way I believe you if you read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" you will see that there is no civiliation, Islamic, American, or otherwise that does not have violent blemishes in its past and present. However, these violent blemishes should not be used to characterize entire civiliations in their entirety which Gabriel's book unfortunately does.    If you want to truly understand the roots of violence perpetrated by a very small group of Muslims (remember there are 1 billion Muslims in the world and those committing acts of violence are drop in the bucket compared to the immense size of the total population - also let's not forget that plenty of violence has been perpetrated by some groups of Christians and Jews both in contemporary times and in the past) than read books by scholars who understand the pain and suffering of the Palestinians, the Iraqis, the Afghanis, and the ongoing humiliation, torture, and death, these people have suffered at the hands of the West, not to mention the humiliating history of European colonization and imperialism that has left its mark on the region. Also be reminded that the U.S.'s support of oppressive dictators in the region is not lost on the people who live and suffer under those oppressive regimes such as Bush's good friends the Saudi royal family. And of course Sadam Hussain, a current villian in the U.S., was once highly favored by the U.S. government who supplied him with arms and other types of aid during the eight year Iran-Iraq war. He lost his popularity with the U.S. government after he decided he no longer liked being a puppet.   For a more accurate in-depth view of the history of the influence of the West on the East read Edward Said's foundational book "Orientalism," "the Question of Palestine," or Arhandati Roy's "An Ordinary Persons Guide to Empire."  Here you will read words and truths from scholars who come from colonized peoples, scholars who are/were not only great writers and scholars but who also write/wrote from a non-western perspective. If you want to understand the perspectives of Arabs and Muslims than reading books written by biased Westerners such as Gabriel is not the way to go. On the other hand if your true motive in reading about Islam is to reinforce your existing hatreds, biases, and stereotypes, by all means read his book with relish - it will serve your intended purpose well.  
 When I found this book in the library searching for information for a paper on transvestites, I thought that this would be the perfect book, based on the title. I was terribly wrong and disappointed. The book analyzes cross-dressers and defines the sub-categories as if it were decribing a species of animals! "This means this" and "by this age the cross-dresser will have realized that." I was disgusted by it!   It seems to me that the author had no true interest in what he was writing about, he was just doing a scientific study. Looking at the subjects of his other books, I found no pattern whatsoever, which leads me to believe this was merely another piece of research he was getting paid for. It was not about a group of individuals, it was about a clan or herd; a "type" of people. Not at all a good source of information.   Not every crossdresser follows the patterns that Talamini sets for them. They are individuals; people, not a species 
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die 
 I was very excited to read this book because I too grew up in southwest philly; I'm also the same age as the writer and figured I would reconize people, places and things mentioned in the book. What I found was street names changed, to protect what, I didn't understand. The author also states he attended Most Blesssed Scarment Catholic School, has a picture of the school included in the book and then doesn't even get to that part of his childhood in this book. That was a hugh misrepresentation to me. I attended M.B.S. and that was the main reason for purchasing the book. Some of his stories I identified with because we were both brought up in the city; but I was disappointed in the book overall. It didn't seem to me the book was about the subject I understood it to be 
 I have been using M-W products for quite a long time. They suffer some user unfriendly features. I like to see the following improvements in this product: 1.	Hot keys to navigate in different fields. For ex.  (Ctr+1) to take me to definition field. 2.	A function key (say F3) to replace double mouse click for pronunciation. 3.	The window remembers its size. 
 I often enjoy reading books written trying to read the future that are several years old. If only to see why the writer was right or wrong and where he went wrong.  Well this book was published in 1996 and is basically written around the US although other countries are mentioned in passing. The basic premises is that the new industries will employ a few people but not enough to make up the fall in the established industries. So the unemployment will go up. Furthermore we better get used to it. His partial solution is reduction in hours of employment and a greater stress on the third sector.  Looking at the US economy which most of the book is written about in the past 50 years the workforce in the US has almost tripled. Yet in the same period there is no long term trend to greater unemployment. Just look at a graph. Currently now its where it was in 1950. So obviously unemployment is not going up. So the writer got it wrong.   Looking at a graph of US unemployments percenatges, its clear that the situation was a bit high at the time of writing. The writer made a typical mistake of many futurologist of extrapolating into the far future based on the past few years.  Furthermore the writer paid too much attention to the publicity departments of R&D companies. He keeps bring us all these new technologies that are going to change the world dramatically eg getting rid of farmers with chemical vats and vanilla production from genetic research. Well, its been 10 years and most of these technologies are still coming. He obviously has forgotten Daniel Bell warning in what is an absolute gem of a book "Coming of Post-Industrial Society" that many futurologist look too hard at industries worth millions of dollars and generalize into industrials worth billions.   He seems to also forget that labour hours are dropping all the time. I am not sure what the situation is in the US but as the pay master in an Australian company, I can see that the labour hours are  steadily dropping every year. For example old timers tell me that the standard office hours 40 years ago was 44 hours a week, by the time I started working it was 40 and now at 38 hours plus now two 10 minutes breaks are included in the working hours so its more like 36 hours week. Furthermore in the past few years the number of sick days a year has gone from 5 days to 8 days a year. Two extra days a year has been introduced for compassionate leave. Long service leave (a holiday of 15 weeks) is now given at 10 years not 15 years. Furthermore the average worker now starts his employment later as he tends to study much more, so early 20s is now quite standard to start working and he retires at 55.  All this works out to a rather dramatic drop in hours worked in a generation.  Finally we come to the third sector. The sector the writer hopes is going to take some of the unemployment.  This is a sector that I have had considerable contact with over the years eg I went to a private school, been active in political and religious organizations, been computer programmer in a private cancer research organization and have been too many private hospitals. I don't see the employment opportunities. The volunteers or people on the committees that he is referring too tend to be at most a few hours a week. Hardly an equivalent of a job. Nor is it generally like they are working. Often its more socialible. The people that work for these organizations tend to be regular workers eg the janitor in the church, the nurse in a charity run hospital or teacher in a religious school does a similar job to the same people in a similar government or private institution. They tend to get paid roughly the same. Often they go from government to private to the third sector depending on who gives them a better deal. I just don't know where the writer is coming from with his arguments here. I suspect that he has little contact with these organizations.  Overall I would say that this book is best forgotten 
 This was my first Amitav Ghosh book after years of hearing people admire him. But I was disappointed. The book starts off interestingly enough, but soon the plot takes over and the characters are reduced to mere devices for the author to make grand political statements about colonialism and its effects. In the process there are simply too many coincidences, too many contrived situations. There is no progression of characters, of a story unfolding. What we get, instead, is a barrage of theses about the postcolonial world.   There are moments of beauty and poignancy in the book, but they are simply too few to hold the reader's attention. Once you get past the professorial lecturing, there's very little by way of a story.   I have since read some of his other books, and I'm happy to say that I liked them all much better than this one 
 I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore 
 I'm shocked that having spent, (what was it?) $200 Million, they couldn't have at least employeed a writer/director who cared about the original medium, Comics, and that pre-existing fanbase. I wouldn't be complaining, but to base it off of the original films, and then ignore so many gems that made the original films enjoyable, simply left a lot to be desired. I feel looking back, that the writers simply wanted to reach non-fans by writing a 'cutting-edge' 'non-traditional' Superman story. It wasn't necessary.  Lastly, while I love Lex Luthor, I found it a shame they chose to keep the Version of Lex who is a Real-Estate Obsessed Super-Villian, who lacks forethought.  I'm beginning to think the heads of WB don't know of any other villians for Supes to fight.  Most shocking is that they signed the writer's up for a trilogy deal, before this movie even hit theaters 
 I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched.  Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings.  Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up.  But it makes a nice coaster, though 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 It's great to see the author writing customer reviews of their own book?  Turned me off from buying the book.  How stupid does she think people are 
 Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original 
 and THEN come follow  Jesus orders us when someone asks for our coat to give our shirt as well.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to get into heaven. Or a capitalist. Jesus said it, not me.  Capitalism is the opposite of Christianity. Study carefully the National Conference of Catholic Bishop's landmark letter Economic Justice for All which damns corporate capitalism as currently practiced under the unelectable Bush regime.   Read the Rev. Father John Dear, SJ. Anything he wrote. Read the most saintly and Catholic Dorothy Day. Winess her life of Chritian witness.  Capitalists cannot be Christian. There is no profit in it. If someone wants your money you give it to them, with a joyful and sincere smile.  Read your Dorothy Day, the greatest American CAtholic EVER! Loaves and Fishes is a good place to start. She said not to give our old clothes to the poor; give them our new clothes instead.  Go back and read your Saint Francis too. What did he say? How did he read and live the Gospel? What did he have?  What would Jesus do? Amass wealth? What did he have when he died?  Even Karl Marx got it closer when quoting Saint Paul that the Christian Community derived from each member according to their talents and gave to each member according to their needs.  This is the OPPOSITE of capitalism which bleeds everyone through their needs (health, housing, food, education, clothing, etc.) and in which the rich alone get richer.  That ain't Christianity by any measure.  Christ leads to true freedom. Not capitalism. Meanwhile: Is the West a success?   And those who believe the hierarchcal church promoted the scientific method need only remember it was not a quarter century the church apologized to the late Galileo, and as recently as the pioneering (ought to be saint) Father Gregor Mendel the church burned his notebooks posthumously and prohibited his publication, of what has now become the basis of biology: genetic codes. 
 I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this book is getting such rave reviews. I found it to be a major disappointment, mostly because the reviews led me to expect much more. This book is for the TOTALLY clueless, ie., those who don't know that rosemary goes with lamb and chicken, apples with pork, beans with bacon, etc. I can see how it could help jumpstart a kitchen novice, but if a professional chef needs this book he/she is in the wrong profession. There's absolutely nothing new here. To make matters worse, it's in boring black and white with not one image (color or otherwise) to inspire or break the monotony. I've tried again and again to find a reason to keep this book but can't come up with one. It's up for sale. Sorry folks, I just can't agree on this one. 
 These 3 girls have nothing good to offer. They don't have the staying power that many REAL country artists have. Their song lyrics are very IMMATURE. 
 First, grab some stock mystery characters off the shelf - a serial killer nick-named Little Jack, (as in Ripper), who has some "religious" issues, a drop dead gorgeous female homicide detective with an aging "seen it all" partner, and a "street tough" ruggedly handsome, up and coming attorney who takes it upon himself to pursue "Little Jack" when his law partner/old flame is brutally murdered, (much in the same manner as Little Jack's previous prostitute victims). Toss is in a few secondary characters such as the attorney's old "Irish" mentor from the streets, a politically motivated bonehead police chief  and the usual political cronies from the Governor's mansion on down. Top it all off with post 9/11 terrorist attack and conclude with a James Bondish finale and one might think this would make a great made-for TV movie, (there's even a cameo appearance from Whitey Bulger) which is exactly how this reads. Unfortunately it doesn't make for a good book. Everything in this book is predictable - the plot, the dialogue, who lives, who dies, good guys, bad guys. The major "twist" in this book occurs halfway in - not in a good Raymond Chandler way, more in an "I saw this 150 pages ago" way - and the "solution/resolution" plods along for another 200+ pages. There are also a multitude of scenes in this book that are not only irrelevant but force the reader to remove him or herself from any concept of reality. I hate to be so negative but with all the hoop-lah surrounding this book, (comparisons to Lehane for instance), I expected much, much more 
 One day when it was 100 degrees outside, I used it in my car, rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop.  When I came out and got into my car, it was hotter than I could have ever imagined.  It hadn't cooled my car prior to that either.  It looked like a very small fan blowing, and that was it.  I came home, took it off, and threw it out.  I was not satisfied at all 
 I did not have "great" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of "Tale of The Two Cities").  But someone told me they at least made a movie about this one so I figured I may as well give it a shot.  Well lets just say that I wont be seeing the movie but I will admit that this one is at least better then the other book because it is just thick enough to balance out this wobbly dresser I have when I weged it under one of the legs.  A better effort!  I give you a generous TWO STARS this time Charlie!  Youre getting there so keep trying 
 I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING!   You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong.   The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.    Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.  I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!  
 I love cookbooks and own thousands, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen - it seems comprised of everything I loathe in a cookbook. It contains many recipes, but no descriptions of what makes them special (and no descriptions at all).  There are often several recipes for the same dish, but nothing to signify what is different about them, which tastes best, etc.  The index sucks (very, very vague) - and 99% of the recipes are not listed in either the table of contents or the index, so the only way to find them is to scroll through the entire book.  There is a full chapter on kuchen recipes, but the word kuchen isn't anywhere in the index, nor are the recipes.  This book was a total waste!  I don't even know if the author ever tasted, much less prepared, any of the dishes - and most definitely can't understand why she was allowed to give herself five stars.  There are many wonderful breakfast cookbooks, and most (if not all) are available here on Amazon.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE 
 Once again, as with IN THE BEDROOM, Todd Field uses cinema to re-present the world of NEW YORKER fiction: once again we are in bourgeois New England, immersed in a world of unhappy marriages, frustration that results in violence and stunning real estate. Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) find herself alienated by the other young mothers at her local playground, who are a bunch of wicked witches who schedule sex once every week and compare plans for how to send their toddlers to Harvard. Into their world of juice boxes and rice cake snacks comes stay-at-home dad Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), known to the mothers as "the Prom King." Sarah begins to flirt with him, and before long they're having a full-fledged secret affair, since she's made miserable by her older wealthy husband (who watches kinky web pornography and, even worse, wears pastel sweaters around his shoulders indoors) and Brad is equally bored by his perfect wife (Jennifer Connolly, made up to look like Demi Moore) and haunted by his inability to pass the bar. Haunting their lives at the fringes are Brad's friend Larry (Noah Emmerich), a retired cop who accidentally killed a child in a shooting, and Larry's current fixation, Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), a convicted child molestor living in their suburb persecuted by the other suburbanities.  Todd Field's point is that in our bids for security and happiness we have all becomes sexual freaks of one kind or another, and yet we all deserve a chance for redemption, given how horrible our lives are (which he emphasizes by his use of gorgeous cinematography to make everything look as empty and hollow as possible). Even such a superbanal moral might have been put over had Field been working from a better script, but the characters in this film are so underwritten and so exceptionally unpleasant you find yourself feeling sorry for the performers: perfectly good actors like Trini Alvarado and Jane Adams are wasted in awful minor roles, and heaven only knows what Jennifer Connolly saw in her character that led her to agree to do this film. Bland, forgettable Patrick Wilson performs the bland, forgettable Brad blandly, forgettably. Jackie Earle Haley works very hard with his role, but he's made up to look even more like Nosferatu than ever, so you can hardly blame the villagers for wanting to hunt him down with torches and pitchforks. Kate Winslet, one of the best young actresses alive, does the best with her role, but even her Sarah Pierce doesn't have much to her, or seem very worthy of the redemption the narrator promises for her at the end of the film. 
 My husband who is off fighting for the Constitution sent this book to our daughter.  If he had not sent it, I would want a refund.  My daughter and I sat down to read the book together.  She thought the drawings did not match the words and thought the author still did not like the Preamble. (HE makes mention in the begining that he was forced to think about the Constitution). There was no inspiration from this book and she hasn't picked it up again.  The pictures are not exciting to children and only vaguely connect to the words.  She loves the Freedom Rock version of the Preamble and and really enjoys Lynn Chaney's "America A Patriotic Primer", so I understand why he made the purchase, however it is not inspiring or uplifting or interesting 
 I own "Howl's Moving Castle" amd "Spirited Away" by Miyazaki and bought "Nausicaa" mainly because of the customer reviews. "One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made." "Greatest Animated Film of All Time." "Best Movie I've Ever Seen." Please help me! This film story is about a young female heroine (who can't afford underpants) with a good heart and a desire to stop all killing in a future world dominated by giant worms. And a worm is a perfect mascot for the tedious, snail crawling pace of this film (everyone viewing almost fell asleep). The plot is slow to develop, character development lacking and animation primitive at best. Of the three Miyazaki films I own, this is the worst. Does it matter who wrote the screenplay? When you put your name on it, it's yours. "Howl's Moving Castle" and "Spirited Away" (which won an Academy Award) have qualities that are totally lacking in this film. These films had characters who's evolution touched my heart, a storyline which captivated me and animation that made me forget that this was animation. Not so with "Nausicaa". The reviewer who claimed that this is "One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made". has obviously never seen "Gone With the Wind", "Ten Commandments", "Ben Hur" or even "The Wizard of Oz". The reviewer who stated that this is "The Greatest Animated Film of All Time." has probably never seen "Dumbo", Pinocchio" or the new "Over the Hedge" or "Open Season" (the animation of the bear fur is beyond realistic). So if you're an animation freak like I am (and not someone who's been paid by Miyazaki to praise his inferior work), who lets the eyes and heart decide what's a good film and if you want good Miyazaki film, pass on this one. If you want great animation, buy "Dumbo" or "Pinocchio". And if you want great films, buy any of the classics like the four movies mentioned before or "King Kong", "Godzilla" or any of the other top 100 films listed by the American Film Institute. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder", so don't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really don't get out much. PS Used "Nausicaa" for sale or trade 
 I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2. 
 After reading the positive reviews, I bought this book.  The introduction said "a few" recipes contain date sugar.  When I went to the section on cookies, I found that all but three of the cookies recipes contain date sugar...usually 1 to 1.5 cups! There are many other books that focus on fruit-sweetened baking...if cookies are your interest, I'd recommend looking at others first 
 I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, "Sideline Ho" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close. 
 This is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy, pre-packaged beliefs. Sure, this series bears some [contrived] humor; How convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some regressive conservative who, with a red face, watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur Michael Moore because of his fabricated "misrepresentations and untruths." I guess I'm writing this because I had the misfortune of seeing "The Awful Truth," and I feel I need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until I have an aneurysm. (If I had an aneurysm, I'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the Shamu tank at Sea World. At least I could warp some kids' minds in the process of dying.)  Every episode is literally like, "AWFUL FACT OF THE DAY: Some obscure, skewed study shows that Americans are dumb and like explosions and I'm Michael Moore an attention-starved clownboat!" Seriously, it's interesting Moore critiques "American Indulgence" when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright. - Thus Says the Pellingto 
 While Berlant is quite definatly a good cultural theorist, the type of work she does is problematic. This book regularly tries to define a national mindset in relation to the productions of a small number of people. While one might be able to analyze any number of the texts mentioned in this book, Berlant insists on saying that these texts relate to a particular way of thinking that are shared by at least a majority of our population (enough to elect republicans to the presidency). She repeatedly uses really loaded/offensive terms, which can be fun if you politically agree with her (for instance patriotism=infantile citizenship, heterosexuality=dead sexuality), but if you disagree even slightly with her they seem mostly like bullying. While I'm rather left leaning, the core of her arguement, that right leaning people vote more based on emotions rather than well thought out ideas, I find to be mostly baseless (I think a misunderstanding of economics and international politics are the reason people vote republican... or immense wealth). Since most of the textual examples she uses I don't think can ever adequatly stand for the majority of the people she claims they represent, and are more caricatures of poltical discourse (which of course most political discourse is) rather than actual personal poltics, her work comes across as being based on a confusion of aggressiveness and refrences to Lacan with strong theorizing.  Unless you want to get into arguements with friends who really like this book, I'd pass it up if I were you 
 As a made for TV movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a Saturday afternoon that you watch because you don't feel like changing the channel, it was okay. As the sequel to GWTW or the screen adaptation of the book I enjoyed reading so much, it was appallingly AWFUL. The acting was weak, and the woman that played Scarlett was mildly attractive at best. It was a complete waist of time and money 
 If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid.  Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.  It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it.   I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't waste your money on it. 
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 To his credit Budziszewski at the outset states the book is not intended to convince the atheist, agnostic nor the skeptic, (be the fly on the wall) For the Christian, I imagine it is a convincing read.  Unfortunately, for someone who is attempting to understand Natural Law without relying on a heavy dose of Christian homily, it is bewildering and seemingly replete with circular, self-referencing.  The author is aware of this and makes no excuses.  But this all begs the question, why write a book for people who are already convinced they are in the moral right because the Bible says so?  There even is a substantial section about Intelligent Design, a proposition so distant from a philosopher's roots and so extreme a "scientific" stance, which gives you a thumbnail measure of how objective Budziszewski's viewpoint is from his Texas school 
 I sat for a long while in my usual  pretentious, elitist state of contemplation, upon the task of writing a lengthy review of all the problems I had with this  cinematic waste of time . . . until I realized that THAT would be a waste of time.  Do yourself a favor: Don't waste your time.  so...so bad    
 I am a big fan of the Requisites series of texts.  In general, they are some of the best introductory radiology textbooks available, with great organization and well selected content.  However, the Musculoskeletal  Requisites has little in common with the other books.  It is organized into  a series of neverending lists, which, while perhaps suitable for a study  guide, make the reading of the book a chore.  While none of the Requisites  books are definitive texts, this one has more holes in its content than the  others as well.  Hopefully the book will be completely revamped for the  second edition.  I can't recommend it in its present form 
 Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.       Worked up my patience and called that evening, only to hold for 48 minutes.  Finally got another native of India who spoke English worse than the first guy. At one point, we were waiting on a restart and I asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded, "OK, yes".  Long story short, I hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which I was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager. During these two calls, the software was uninstalled, reinstalled, and tested and I spent several hours using the online support.  I updated the product and it worked for a couple hours.  Then I was right back where I began, unable to access the internet unless I turned off the Worm Protection.  I started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once I updated, the protection center now says my subscription is expired. When I check my Norton account online, it shows I have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed.  Sent an email to the management address I was given, but of course, haven't heard anything.  I am uninstalling this product and will never use Norton again.   
 The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published 
 The monster was pretty fake. The jokes were corny. The special effects...were there any? The underwater shots were grainy. At times, it was over-acted. This movie was so-so. It won't scare you. The Alien series or The Cave are much better. This movie may have been okay in its day, but times have changed...and movie making have improved a lot...a whole lot. Skip this flick 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 This movie is true garbage.  It made no sense, had no real plot, did not offer any clever deaths or humor, or gratuitous skin.  The ending leaves you feeling stupid for having watched it all the way      to the end.  I had to wake myself up 3 times during this movie, I wish I had just stayed asleep.  The horror, the horror.  Actually, the sheriff was kind of wierd and creepy because you knew he was not acting (there was no acting) and you worry that someone like that is walking around out there.  I think the people who liked this movie are trying to sell their used copies that are good for landfill only.   Basically, the plot was about to make some headway at the end, but then they ran out of money or maybe their 486 computer they were using to edit it died.  Or maybe they got bored and walked off the set.  Becuase their was no explanation of who killed everyone, and everyone except the innocent girl was dead.  It had a chainsaw killing and lots of scythe beheading, but I just could  not care.  If I could give this movie negative stars I would, but 1 star is the lowest.  
 Of historical interest only, this book never was a comprehensive overview of musical acoustics, instead focusing on Benade's interests.  Now, it is horribly outdated.  Much interesting work is not in here...in fact there is no really top notch acoustics book with modern research available at this time 
 I work in IT. Given the current state of the industry, I don't recommend it as a profession to my son, nor would I recommend it to my daughter, if I had one.   The book is an example of research addressing the general question: "Why oh why are other people not living their lives in ways that we, the researchers, deem appropriate?" There may be a book-length explanation to that, but then again, maybe they just don't feel like it 
 Horrible book. Islamic literature is distinct in that information can be classified into 'authentic','fabricated', 'weak', as well as many other categories by rigourously analyzing the chains of narration. The author did not bother with that and, it seems, assumed that whatever he quoted from some book of history (say, Tarikh Tabari) was authentic. Save your $$$, and buy something more credible and scholarly (e.g. Al-Bidaya wal-Nihaya) 
 This was used as a college textbook in my class, and to be blunt, I and several other classmates were shocked at the poor quality.  Spelling mistakes, poor grammar, etc. abound.  If ever a book needed a good editor, this is the one!  It escapes with 2 stars instead of 1 because the patient reader and beginner Library Science student may be able to glean some helpful advice from the text.  At the very least, it seems the late William A. Katz knew a thing or two about the subject of reference work.  I have to believe there are MANY better resources on this subject however.  If not, then someone needs to start writing, there's money to be made!  (Review edited for spelling 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 Te Celestine Prophecy is the only book I've ever read more than once. I love it. I started the Tenth Insight immediately after finishing the Celestine Prophecy for the second time and I couldnt beleive this was written by the same author. Did something happen to Redfield between writing these 2 books? Most of the first book is very believable and enlightening, but the second is a complete whirlwind of nuttiness and mostly, in my opinion, totally over the top. I found myself skipping page upon page of rambling. Very weird, and a little disappointing really 
 This book is more of a left-wing diatribe then real, intelligent economic analysis.  
 Did I expect too much?  I anticipated so much more from Douglas Gresham.  Was he writing for children?  Even children deserve to be treated as if they could understand words of more than one sylable.  Presumably many people who would be interested in reading about C. S. Lewis have some knowledge of the man, this particular book was entirely too condescending.  Who needs to have definitions of simple words explained? In addition, there was almost nothing new in this description of Lewis.  I hardly categorize it as "biography"; more an effort to sell yet another book given the hype over recent notice of Lewis' works.  I could not recommend it in good conscience. Voracious Reade 
 I was excited to read this book, as I have a degree in criminology from a British university and currently research firearms in the U.S.  I was very disappointed. While this book has interesting points about perceptions of  crime, the American political process, and the troubling state of criminal  justice, its research methods and analytic conclusions are deeply flawed.   Windlesham critiques American crime policy and law using examples of crimes  in Britain, as if Britain and the U.S. could and should be compared without  hestitation. He critiques NRA statements and policy recommendations as  misguided ideology, but uses Handgun Control Inc.'s writings as if it was  scholarship.  He barely refers to any concrete criminological studies on  firearms, prefering to use medical studies on guns, which most sociologists  and criminologists have illustrated are often deeply methodologically  flawed.  He does not use the solid scholarship on guns in the U.S. written  by well-known criminologists, even when that research would reinforce his  overall points. Lastly, he glosses over research on the Second Amendment  and its supposed impediment to gun control, using partisan writings and  very little work from legitimate lawyers and historians.  Overall, this  book was a serious disappointment.  For much better research in a similar  vein, try books by Franklin Zimring, Gary Kleck, or Jan Dizard et al.'s  book "Guns in America."  Though very different, these works are  honest attempts to understand complicated issues. Windlesham's book is not 
 BORING.  I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak 
 As someone who lived (and, I guess, is still living) the life of a "gifted" person, I'm not terribly surprised by what I found in this book.  Many of the problems held by gifted students originate not from parents but from bureaucrats--people who want to figure out how best to control their talents for profit.  There isn't much profit for the parents themselves, so where's the profit going to come from?  Other than those kids marked by stock brokers and scientists for high-paying jobs, what's left?  Political profit, of course, and this is Quart's real goal.  Quart simply oppresses her topic into non-existence unless it can produce the right kind of person that will be sure to vote the right way.  Scrabble players, spelling bee kids, math geniuses...they're all weird at best and dangerous at worst, *especially* if they've been home-schooled or attend church.  Competitors in chess are hyper-competitive, but (surprisingly?) kids participating in politically-charged poetry slams are "encouraging" and "supportive".  She weeps for school districts that support the gifted and thereby thwart the  "equal results" that certain political groups seek, yet cannot find anything but disdain for programs that support the results of all students  simply (and clearly) because of the political party that happened to begin it.  Her descriptions of her subjects are caricatured so badly that one cannot have any faith in the descriptions.  And, as some have noted below, she has played loose and fast with those she quotes in order to make the right sort of case.  If you have the ability to ignore or refute the author's opinions through basic critical-reading skills, you can get a basic idea of the sorts of issues faced by the gifted.  If not, look elsewhere 
 It's an introduction, all right.  The trouble is, it's such a high level introduction that there's almost no useful information whatsoever.  The entire time I was reading, I was waiting for the author to get to the meat, only to discover at the end that there was none.  It was like ordering a double cheeseburger, and getting two buns with ketchup and a pickle, and no beef patties.  I can only assume that Rational paid the author for his time in the hopes that people, after reading this book, would purchase their entire software suite just to find out what the RUP actually involves.  Despite my severe disappointment (and relief that I didn't have to pay for it myself), I can't rate it any lower than two stars.  It's well written, and it could quite possibly be useful to managers and other business types who have no idea how software development works.  The second star is for Rational's sheer chutzpah in getting a respected publisher to put out a $30 marketing pamphlet for them 
 he gets 2 for 2 good songs in the whole cd!this cd blows 
 The simplified arrangements in this book gut the harmonic resonance of almost all the songs.  Numbers like "Dividing Day" and "The Beauty Is" are very nearly unrecognizable.  Thank you for the performance edition of "Light in the Piazza," now please,    release the Vocal Score, Mr. Guettel 
 The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things: - Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand. - Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.  These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy 
 This product is useless. I purchased it because I have the new Ipod video player- which is a little more fragile then the previous.. well- I see this product which I thought would be great. but- It most certainly is not! Its awful. There were air pockets all over- and no matter how much I tried, my brother tried- or my friends- the air pockets would not go away. If you want air pockets all over your viewing screen then get this.. if not- I would suggest somthing different! This is horrible and a waste of money!!! 
 I have been a Betty Grable fan since I was small.  It is odd for a kid today to rather watch old movies than new ones.  I am now in my twenties and interested in bios.  Betty and Ginger Rogers have always been my favorites.  After reading this book, I do not like Betty Grable.  It seems as if the author and Ms. Grable are both very stuck on HER.  She seems VAIN from my understanding of the book.  I could not finish it because the more I read, the more I disliked her, and I want to enjoy her movies.  Ginger Rogers "Ginger: My story" and Ester Williams "Million Dollar Marmaid" autobiographies were much more interesting.  I suggest those over this one any day 
 I originally purchased this HDTV back in September but it had to be replaced because the digital tuner(ATSC) was defective and the ATSC would crash while i was watching digital TV so the picture would freeze and i would have to restart the TV to watch digital TV.   Olevia replaced that defective tv with a new tv same model and it worked fine for about 2 months now it has an unsightly thin vertical blue line going threw the middle of the screen. So now olevia has to replace my tv for a second time in 6 months. I've never experienced such poor quality electronics in my life and I will never buy another product from olervia-syntax. I would give this product 0 stars if i could. DONT buy this (...). 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 Ah, Pierre, you lusty Frenchman, where do you go wrong? Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for "Moby-Dick" or "Bartleby the Scrivner" for a real sense of Melville's writing 
 There is always an invisible factor that comes to play in these "Bell Curve" type books. The authors absolutely refuse to confront or even address the impressive successes of countless educators who have shown time and time again, that all races can learn and function at the highest levels of academia. I think that any one who tries to write a book of this sort has a professional if not ethical obligation to explain how the actual high achievements of  blacks and other so called inferior races factor into their elitist philosophies. I only hear about how these gains have been coached, or they haven't translated into career success.In the first place, you can coach a student on an IQ test, but you can't coach him all through his academic career.Either he is getting smarter, or he's not!Secondly, read of the work of minority educators, like Lorraine Monroe, Thaddeus Lott, Jaime Escalante, Gertrude Baker, Marva Collins, Herb Koehler, among others, who have PERMANENTLY altered the IQs of countless black and hispanic children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Dr. Lynn needs to be very careful, or he will suffer the same embarrassment the Bell Curve authors did when they made the egregious blunder of mentioning Marva Collins and saying that her work with ghetto kids was too good to be true. This prompted 60 minutes to do an in-depth follow-up story on the children they first interviewed in her  school some 20 years earlier. According to a statistician, most of these kids should have been in jail, dead or on welfare. None of the children were. In fact, most of them had been through college ( including Ivy League schools)and were lawyers, teachers,scholars, and productive members of society. Why doesn't Lynn and Jensen and Murray do in-depth research on these educators and their charges before writing so-called scientific and scholarly works? It is not paper theses and theories formulated in some isolated laboratory that matters, but the actual work of real live teachers, who are on the front lines every day, challenging disadvantaged children, and singlehandedly discrediting books like RACE DIFFERENCES. These teachers form the most potent yet invisible evidence for democratic vs. elitist education. Thank God their work has undermined  Richard Lynn's book before it ever went to print.What is  being discussed, achievement or intelligence? To write a book of this nature is indicative of some ulterior political motive, or worse! Do not read this book, unless, out of fairness, you read Intelligence Can Be Taught by Arthur Whimbey. Then make a balanced and fair-minded opinion, based on all the facts, instead of reading a book that only justifies your deeply entrenched prejudices. 
 Well if you want to see Angelina Jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy, if you don't then leave the movie alone it's just another teen rebelion movie 
 For many years, Middle East departments of American universities including Columbia have provided intentionally fake and fraudulent education on Middle East problem and history to American students.  The Table below lists major milestones of the Middle East history and demonstrates that long before Arabs came in Palestine, there were Jewish states and Jerusalem was a capital of one of them.  In 1917-18, British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land (Palestine) from the Turks. During the WWII, Palestinian Arab clerics contacted Hitler and asked him to exterminate Palestinian Jews. There prove, that Jews lived there before creation of the state of Israel in 1948.   The 1964 PLO Charter addressed to UN used term "Palestinian Arabs" and PLO did not claim Judea, Samarea (so called West Bank), and Gaza their territories.  The term and national group "Palestinians" have been invented some time after 1967 by Arabs who fooled the entire world because the world would like to be fooled.  They also invented a fable that Jews never lived in Palestine. In 2003, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq, together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland were preparing an enormous lawsuit against all the Jews of the world.  They blamed Israelites, who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC, of stealing gold from Egypt.  In other word, Dr. Nabil Hilmi and his colleague acknowledged that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land.

 Seven Times The Sun is not for everyone. It could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life. But the songs, poems and traditions offered in Shea Darian's book are hokey and contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. None of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. But I'm just thankful Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy 
 I loved Bridges, but I can't say the same for the sequel. I think the sequel should never have been written 
 All four members have ample singing time this time around but the material is still mediocre. "U Already Know" was a hit but their follow-up(s) weren't. They've been in the business for ten years now and they can sing but they got the wrong team working with them. Leave Def Soul and get some better writers/producers 
 We were interested in seeing how historically accurate Puccini's opera, Madama Butterfly was, so we purchased Van Rij's book.  However, in his section entitled "How Japanese is it" he speculates that "Surandasico" might be a garbled reading of "zurugashikoi" meaning cunning, an adjective.  First of all, he misspelled "sarundasico" as it occurs in the opera librtetto and somehow never discovered that there is a Shinto kami named "sarudahiko" which we found via Google.  If this one detail is so far off, how can the rest of the book be much better?    Additionally his assessment of the character, Butterfly, is unbelievably dismissive.  It should not take a great deal of imagination to figure out why she would want to marry an American, considering her station and the lack of true and binding marriage rights for women of her station in Japan at that time.  Nevertheless, the other parts of the book were interesting and the photographs from the Meiji Restoration Period were helpful in our research.  Regards - Adam and Tam 
 I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining! 
 The game plan in Mark Burnett's hit reality TV show The Apprentice is to ruthlessly eliminate 15 of its 16 contenders, in its bid to identify the best man or woman for the top job in one of billionaire Donald Trump's corporations. In the event, it sheds light on the ways and means Trump, estimated by Forbes to be worth US$1.74bil (RM6.6bil), and the likes of him may have undertaken on the warpath to building their own business empires.   The contenders are divided into two teams: Protege and Versacorp, where they are expected to compete against the rival team and against members of their own team for leadership posts while maintaining teamwork throughout 15 frenetic episodes.   They are thus put through a series of tests to gauge their team leadership skills, competitive spirit, business acumen, passion, gumption and more. These tests have included an advertising campaign for a card that allocates private jet service by the hour, an AIDS benefit auction, art exhibition, running a lemonade stand and selling bottled drinking water.    Although Trump appears only at the end of each episode to eliminate one person from the losing team - and briefly at the start - he really is the star of the show which is an induction into his world. Choosing his apprentice by shrewdly assessing their strengths and weaknesses, with the help of assistants George and Carolyn, Trump cuts a clear picture of the type of person that will fit in his world.    According to Parinello, a Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and Gottfried, a regular columnist for The Apprentice on www.the-trades.com, the ideal candidate will be familiar with all or most of these 10 Trump-approved methods:   Think Big. Show the Competition No Mercy. Defend Yourself Aggressively. Remember, Consensus Is Overrated. Identify All Possible Resources, and Use Them Strategically. Cut Your Losses. Get Face-to-Face With Key Decision-Makers. Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Negotiate Tough.    Employers look for people who dare go after a riskier but more potentially rewarding path, who will pull through more often than not. These are what Trump calls Big Thinkers. The apprentice will have to be this and much, much more.   The apprentice will have to be able to Show the Competition No Mercy. He does this by identifying and neutralising competition - both outside and inside. He recognises there will be team-mates who are not above stealing his ideas or credit for his work, or sabotaging his ambitions.   If things take a turn for the worse and they sometimes do, the apprentice will Defend Himself Aggressively. It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, what matters is that he steps up and defends himself aggressively. How he tackles false charges and inaccuracies will be perceived as a measure of his fighting spirit.   The problem with group-think is that the watered down solution that is agreeable to everyone is rarely often the best solution, that Consensus is Overrated - so, when in a leadership position, his team cannot come to a compromise, he takes what he thinks is the best idea and runs with it.   Being able to Identify All Possible Resources and Use Them Intelligently, especially non-cash resources like getting things one needs without paying full price for them, ingenious methods of attracting potential customers, getting people to work for free, goes a long way to aiding continual business survival. The apprentice recognises this and uses the resources to his advantage.   And if things somehow don't work according to plan, the apprentice will Cut His Losses, and move on. In a leadership position, these include reshuffling a team, changing a design, approach or product line and firing someone. Continuing with something or someone that is not working is a waste of resources, time and energy.   To win over a position or a business, the apprentice will Get Face-to-Face with Key Decision Makers as often as possible, and make his case with passion and style. Non verbal communication counts and face time will give him the chance to feel out his contact's distinct way of interacting with the world. More importantly, he will get to bond with that person.   Failure comes with the territory but the apprentice knows how to Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. He recognises the right risks as the ones that present the possibility of a high payoff, have manageable downsides, take advantage of his demonstrated strengths and resources and neutralises his competition.   In any business situation, the apprentice knows that he only has a certain number of hours to work on it, so it makes sense to Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Business propositions that can't be expected to realistically deliver a minimum level of profit are a dime a dozen - he recognises those.    The apprentice will Negotiate Tough but flexibly, remembering every negotiating partner is different, thus no two negotiations will be alike. So, he researches beforehand, adapts his strategy to the person he is talking to, pushes when he can and walks away when he should.    The TV series is dramatic and addictive for its soap-opera-like quality, the way knives are constantly being hurled into the backs of rivals, metaphorically of course.    The authors of this book appear to have cleverly gleaned the lessons from the series - presumably towards good profit. So that after the show ends, you can still hold in your hands the book, 10 Secrets I Learned from The Apprentice, to be referred to again and again in quieter moments.     
 I was quite disappointed by this book - its like a 19th century history with a shallow retelling of the names of Sultans, dates and major battles. I would have expected a greater analysis of the socio-cultural milieu in which the Ottoman empire arose and the institutions it spawned. I kept reading on hoping that this would follow but its really just a chronological listing of sultans, the major battles fought - if you want a political history of the empire, this may work for you. But when, why not just read the Wikipedia entry if you have no interest in the socio-political institutions.   
 Homer Kelly is an engineer who has written a book about the golf swing that is supposedly "The computer age approach to golfing perfection". But it could equally well be written by Homer Simpson, because it is almost impossible to understand. This book reminds me of the holy bible: it is so vaguely written that it opens up to a host of different interpretations, and no two readers will come away with identical perceptions. This may work for the bible, but for a work that promotes the truth about the golf swing it simply won't do.  For incongruous reasons, Homer doesn't use ordinary scientific terms when describing golf. He doesn't use ordinary golf terms either, so this makes his ideas very hard to follow.   There are several other reasons for this: 1) No logical flow. He begins in mid-scenario and describes clubhead-ball interaction and mixes hand action and other body parts into the plot without hesitation.  2) He prescribes, that you should read the book in a most strange order: Chapter 1, 1st part of chapter 12, 1st part of chapter 14, chapter 8, chapter 9, 1st part of chapter 7, 1st part of chapter 10, 1st part of chapter 11, 2nd part of chapter 12 etc. If he wants people to read the book like this, why didn't he write it like that? It is not that he didn't have the time as he allegedly spent 28 years writing it, and he has re-written some of the chapters since the first publication!  3) The terms used are neither scientific nor golf related. They are home-made and quite illogical. And they are never explained when first introduced.   The reason I can say with confidence, that it is not a scientific book, are manifold: 1) The notationes used are not scientific. 2) No cause and effect explained, only description of static positions (geometries). 3) You can't make predictions or even calculations with his theories. 4) No documentation what so ever are presented.   I believe that this fellow used to be a pretty good golfer, handicap 1 or thereabouts, and that he has evolved some major observations into this comprehensive - but very far from conclusive, volume.  One of the major "findings" in The Golfing Machine is, that there are two principally different ways of golfing: swinging versus hitting. But strangely enough, they show identical golf swings even though the dynamics (and body parts) used to propel the club are different. But how can different dynamics result in identical swings? If the applied forces in two swings are different, then the two swings will have different dynamics and will look different. And conversely, if two swings look the same, then the forces that produced the swings has to be identical. This is pure Newtonian physics. Anything else doesn't make sense.  Homer also states that you can move either of your wrists in 6 different directions. You can cock them, bend them, roll them, arch them, turn them etc. But what good is this notation when he doesn't tell which movements are preferable? It doesn't bring clarity, only confusion.   Homer also states that the best way to swing a golf club is with a flat left wrist. And that may very well be true (especially if he bothered to define "best"), but how did he arrive at that conclusion, and how can the reader trust that he is right? Has he grabbed the idea from thin air, is it a result of a logical train of thoughts, real life observations or maybe calculations on mathematical models? No clues are given, no references warrants his findings.  I sincerely believe, that I would go stark raving mad if I had to read this book for a sustained period of time. It is that frustrating! He picks the golf swing apart into 1000 pieces, but he never puts it back together. It feels like having a puzzle of 1000 pieces from 1000 different puzzles.  For all I know, Homer could be a misunderstood genius or a raving lunatic - it is very hard to make a clear decision based on the contents of the book, because it is so difficult and frustrating to read and understand. My assumption leans towards the latter - but I could be wrong 
 This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured.   
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 I borrowed this DVD from a friend and am SO glad I did not pay for this!  Had this been my first look at Salsa it would have been my last.  Marlon has not the least idea how to teach dancing!  This DVD almost sucked the joy of dancing out of me.  "Anyone Can Dance Salsa" is a much better choice 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 OK, this is where I got off the SY bandwagon once and for all. Jet Set Etc. was bad enough, but this was the pits, and I wasn't going to sit around pretending that these languid, aimless ditties had any worth (of course with the usual caveat - The Diamond Sea is amazing). This was a once great and powerful band whose creative faculties had utterly dried up, and this is from a huge erstwhile fan. So I just tuned SY out of my life for over a decade, til a friend recently lent me Sonic Nurse and I found they had inexplicably found a new lease on creative life. Anyway, the 2 stars are for Diamond Sea, the rest of the album is sonic (and lyric) garbage 
 I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.  I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats & fun lyrics.  The other standout tracks to me are:  HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the track  WILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r&b track with great beats that again, work well with her vocals  LET ME - has an interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern sound  RUSH - again, a great dance track  It's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer.  Honestly, I'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as "artists".  They are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances 
 all this dude does is release bubble gum garbage songs like whatyou know about that etc. well mr ti what you know about rap. cause ya sure dont get any lyrical skills i hope you dont think you are going to make people think you are king of the south with garbage like this 
 The general theme of this book is, to quote Lerner and Loewe in My Fair Lady, "Why Can't a Woman be More Like a Man?"  Frankel does point out some behavioral tics that women would do well to ditch, like the infamous framing of statements as questions. But she goes far beyond that to advocate what is essentially a complete overhaul of behavior, appearance, speech, body language, office decor and relationship style. Women are urged to act in ways that feel unnatural all day, every work day. I don't think even Meryl Streep could keep that up for long. Work is inherently stressful and exhausting enough without pretending to be something you're not 50 hours a week.  Frankel encourages women to think that to be female is to be inherently flawed. Freud must be smiling, wherever he is.   Maybe to some women the pursuit of "the corner office" or however they define outward success is worth sacrificing their personhood, but I question the assumption that male behavior is the normative standard to which women must conform---or fail. The corporate and political worlds have historically been dominated by supposedly male traits of aggression, competitiveness and "winner take all" (I doubt, by the way, whether men as a group consistently display those traits), and look where that's gotten us--Enron, obscene executive compensation at the expense of other employees, falling middle class wages, growing disparity between wealth and poverty, foreign policy debacles. I think women should be trying to improve the organizations of which they are a part instead of slavishly copying male behavior that has proved dysfunctional. Let's face it---a man is going to "outman" a woman every time.  
 2 1/2 stars  Despite this album's horrible vocals and carnie-on-acid vibe, there are actually many times throughout the disc that you hear an amazing young band with some real fire in their approach. This album does work better as a sheer party favor for your head then an actual musical exploration, be sure that you want to embrace your inner 15 year old partying teen mode complete with crappy garage band rehearsal vibe, and you will appreciate this alot more  
 I ordered the book expecting the breakthrough system advertised on the cover.  Instead, the book is about going to networking events to meet people to trade referrals with.  I guess that's ok if that's your thing but it's not mine, it sure never got me anywhere, heck, the top sales guys I know won't even bother with those events.  The first 100 pages are spent just trying to convince you that referral selling is the only way to sell.  Ok so cold calling is out but I don't think referral selling is the only option.  I might have given the book a better rating if the cover told the truth and I knew I was buying a book about going out to networking mixers. Referral selling is old news and there are plenty of other books about it.  I feel let down by what I got.  And you know what?  The book isn't half bad if going to networking events is your thing.  That's why I gave it better than one star.  But why not tell people what they're getting up front?  The author needs to study up on relationship selling because you sure don't build good relationships by promising one thing and delivering another.  And why are all the 5-star reviews from people in her area in CA 
 All of the glowing conservative reviews of this book seem to leave out one important fact - the author has no qualifications to speak on any of these subjects. John Berlau is a conservative journalist, always has been, always will be. He has no education in science at any level. How does someone write a book about environmental science without any science background?? This book should be better placed in the fiction section of your local bookstore. Of course conservatives love the content of the book. It re-affirms all their tortured logic. This book is one more cornerstone in the conservative movement to undermine modern science. If you like Asbestos and DDT you will love this book. The author acts as if all the peoples of the world would be better off if we allow Dupont to bask us in a shower of their great industrial products. None of the conservative sheep who have placed comments here have given any thought to the reality of what John Berlau is saying. We should bring back Asbestos, DDT, and while we are at how about the Ford Pinto. He never makes the connection that if these industrial products kill people what good are there minimal positive benefits. If the owner of a home with Asbestos dies from cancer what benefit does that owner get from the Asbestos fire retardant agent? The answer of course is none - the fire is a possibility, the cancer is a guarantee. The only beneficairy here is the same one that is paying John Berlau's salary, as well as his employer a.ka.(Heritage Foundation) American Industry. Three cheers for DDT!!!, Three Cheers for Asbestos, Three Cheers for Exxon-Mobil and a final THREE CHEERS for 2009 when all these delusional people will no longer be making public policy. 
 I couldn't disagree more heartily with those who recommended this book as a "beautiful coffee table book." At this price and with this subject matter this could have been a truly amazing look at the history of the House of Chanel and it's transition from the early years of Coco to the present leadershiop of Karl Lagerfeld. The text is mediocre and the photos are terrible. The general visual quality of the book is absolutely reprehensible.The dresses are all reproduced in a poor quality "Liz Taylor in the White Diamonds commercial" fake fuzzy lens. There is not one really great photo of an actual garment in this entire book. As someone who saw the actual exhibit the book is based on, I feel the Metropolitan really missed on this one. The exhibit itself was magnificent, this poorly concieved book is a complete dud. Save your money for one of the many other books detailing the life and work of Coco Chanel 
 The use of Soviet bloc sources, at first glance, nearly persuaded me that Reagan merits hero-worship. But the superficial handling of the 1946 Hollywood strike made me wonder, in general, about omissions. So, I scanned through the index. There is no entry for "Beirut" or "Lebanon" or "marine barracks" or "national debt." The author informs the reader that marines diverted, at sea, from Beirut landed on Grenada on February 23, 1983. He does not inform the reader that, on February 23, 1983, over 200 marines were killed by a truck bomb in Beirut. What a startling coincidence! How can the author fail to mention it? But, of course, then he does not have to report the cut and run from Beirut - nor consider what the terrorists may have learned about the efficacy of asymmetric war comparing the firm response in Grenada to the limp response in Lebanon.  Upon consideration, this book did not push me from the opinion I formed several years ago that Ronald Reagan is the third most overrated President in American history. 
 A. S. Byatt's work can be excellent. Her short stories are really marvelous, and "Possession" was a wonder - full of life and characters and plot. In the series that is capped by this novel, I continue to find "The Virgin in the Garden" an outstanding work and "Still Life" quite remarkable. However, "A Whistling Woman" is too large, it covers too many topics, too much history and too much science (done without any spirit) and too many stories. The period explored by the novel certainly encompassed all these things, but why did the novel try to do the same. Should not the novelist sift through and bring forth something that crystallizes the period, rather than load the reader with details and leave us wondering at the end why we plowed through such a "big" book only to find a clueless, pregnant Frederica. The work loses focus, flattens characters and in the end finishes rather lamely - dead characters either we hardly knew or from whom we expected more; live characters who have disappeared into clichs, and romances that even the author seems reluctant to accept. I have to admit, the energy of the 60s does seem to have ended in pregnant 70s girls in Laura Ashley dresses, but I do think that Byatt should have left this novel to sit for awhile, and come back to it after a little reflection, crafting a finer piece, which her readers deserve. Let's hope now that Byatt has the series behind her, she will be freed to write a more wonderful work 
 Men and women have equal sex drives,deal with it!What makes us  different is the constant shaming women get when they do indeed act sexual.If you have the word "slut" hanging over your head constantly it just might make you want to cling to romance in order to appear less sexual than a man.Gray generalizes,and not only generalizes but makes women out to be sexless objects there to please men and not themselves. He writes as though he has a great fear of men and women being  equal in sex drive.His mysogamist views of women are  disgusting! In short what he says is,the woman only has to look nice for the man,and the man has to romance,begg and trick women into  bed because women in his mind really don't want or need sex. 
 This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, "The View".  Jez... 
 In reading this collection one would think that the US intends to plunder and pillage Iraq while at the same time destroying their social, economic, and political fabric.  We are responsible for their treatment of women, poor economic choices, Saddam's palaces, and the destruction of the World Trade Center.  This is complete left-wing drivle that uses blinders only to exploit negative events and completely ignore anything positive occuring in Iraq today.  If you're looking for an objective review of conditions in Iraq today stay clear of this one 
 What could have been an interesting plot - it sounds like a Tim Powers novel when described - wasted by horribly shallow, one-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic characters. I managed to drag myself through it, but the conclusion was ultimately unsatisfying, the turn-arounds in the characters unexplained an unbelievable. Don't bother 
 These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame 
 Will you learn anything? Yes, Dont buy another book like this and waste your money! Every chapter is one ad after another 
 A nice try but just not that useful, I keep finding it falling out and U think it ended up on the couch now 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 Mr. De La Torre claims to teach the Ernest Jones method (which produced numerous national champions on both sides of the Atlantic) but then pollutes the Jones method by taking the hands out of the downswing.  After unsuccesfully trying Manuel's method for a while, I happened upon Arnie Frankel's Golf's One Motion video.  It is a much more straight forward presentation of the Jones method.  Understanding the Golf Swing misses the mark 
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts.  Prechter should have left it at that.  Instead, he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott "wave counts."   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  He's imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn't care.  It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market's aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the '87 crash.    Any superstitution can "seem" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you'll find what you're looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you'll find those too.  The market doesn't care about any of those things, though.  It's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection.   If Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.  Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn't think it could break $400), to deflation (the "deflation" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years.  He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they've been telling him that since about 1990, actually).  Prechter doesn't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render "Dow 400" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don't think Prechter is counting on that).  Our debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade.  It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates.  But it's not happening now and it's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade.  This book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market.  How typical.  While promoting the book, Prechter said it was "definite" that stocks would "crash" in 2003.  He said that 2003 would be "the best year yet" for bears (short sellers).  Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would "certainly" fall below 5,000.  Wrong again!  Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future, maybe next he'll tell us he's found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus' writings.  Bob Prechter couldn't call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages.  This guy couldn't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch.  He's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as "definite" and "certain."  He's either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions.  In either case, he's not credible.  Here's all you really need to know: Buy dividend stocks.  Buy short-term bonds.  Buy gold.  Hang on to them.  Do that and you'll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus.  Plus, you'll have a lot more time to devote to family, fun, and productive activities 
 The movie Like It Is, directed by Paul Oremland, has to deal with a boxer/fighter Craig (Steve Bell) as a guy who is trying to crawl out from the fighting life he is in. Craig meets Matt (Ian Rose) who is a band manager/record producer who takes a romantic interest in Craig and the two head off to London. It is in London that trouble begins to unravel the relationshi as Matt's boss tries to split the two up. The movie wraps up with Matt trying to get Craig back before their relationship is doomed. Both Steve Bell and Ian Rose do a decent job of acting in spite of the terrible script that is so disjointed by terrible editting and poor scene transition. There really is nothing new in this film: drugs run rampart, pretty boys litter the set, and sleazy gritty characters are plentiful. In addition, the fight scenes make you wince with how fake it come across. The lack of character development doesn't fully connect the viewer and the drama happening to the characters in the story, thus by the time half the movie is done you really don't care if Craig and Matt get together or not. The only glimmer of promise in this movie was the techno soundtrack which was fairly funky and enjoyable. Finally, when the movie comes to an abrupt end, Like It Is seems more like a recipe on what a movie shouldn't be 
 I have noticed that some people have really hated this movie and called it really bad.  I don't think that this is the case.  A really bad movie can still be entertaining because you end up laughing at the movie.  With that in mind, I don't think that Must Love Dogs is a bad movie.  I think it is just mediocre.  There are some bright spots to the movie: my favorite being when Lane's father reads from W.B. Yeats.  The problem is that through most of the rest of the movie, I sat on my couch wondering what the weather was like outside, what I should get my mother for Christmas, and what I should make for supper.  Rarely, if ever, did my attention focus on the movie.  The biggest reason is that I didn't care about the characters.  Given that the leading parts are played by extremely good actors, I have to assume that the movie fell apart in a different place: the direction, the editing, the script, or a combination of all three.  I tend to believe that it is the later.  There are some scenes that are cut off before they can really resonate emotionally.  Other scenes are drug out so long that if you cared about them to begin with, you have totally forgotten why you cared by the time you get to the end.  Ultimately, this had the potential to be an entertaining and enjoyable movie; however, too many things were botched.  If you are a really big Cusack or Lane fan or extremely bored, you might want to pick this up at your local rental store, but I definately would not recommend buying it.  It just isn't a movie that needs to be in anyone's collection 
 Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel.  I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up 
 I don't think they do a very good job because there are always little specks floating in the bowl that do not seem to be filtered out. Warning: If you are buying for the first time, BE SURE to run cold water over the filters before putting them in your cat fountain.  Otherwise, your water will become very dirty with charcoal 
 Over 50% of this book is bibliography.  Despite the title, it is not written in a history book format.  The books exams in deep detail many facits of the Goths i.e. the first chapter exams the meaning of the word "gens."  Reading this book is hard work and a challenge.  It is difficult to put the facts, as layed out by the author, in a historical time-line 
 I had used some of the earlier books in this series to teach my children and had enjoyed them.  In this last book, however, the author is writing about history that many of us have actually lived through.  I was disappointed and surprised to find that her writing was so biased and opinionated.  I really wish she had just stuck to the facts.  Although she is entitled to her opinion, and these opinions gave us a lot to talk about, because of her own bias she emphasized certain issues and people, while barely mentioning others.  Towards the end of the book I found that she had some of her facts simply outright wrong, and this was disheartening as it cast a shadow on all the information reported in her other books.  I found it very surprising that a history book for children would have errors in the facts, and that it would be used to so shamelessly support someone's personal political agenda.  Again, there is no reason why someone can't write and publish a book like this, but it should not be presented as an unbiased children's "history" book, because this book is certainly not that.  I was quite disappointed 
 Don't bother buying this one. If you are a big Bette Davis fan, check out the library. You won't feel cheated. The book is dull and shallow. Can't say I care for the author's style or her content 
 These did nothing for me. Ask your doctor about aphthasol, a prescription drug approved by the FDA -- which means it's passed rigorous government testing standards. Aphthasol changed my life 
 Veronica contains little action.  The story is more "recited" than told.  The book's heroine actually had an interesting story to tell, but the writing made it boring.  
 In the first film JAWS (1975), Police Cheif Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) of Amity Beach had to deal with a giant shark up close.  In JAWS 2 (1978), Brody's senses told him that giant shark is still out there and while finding his two sons, he meets the shark again.  In JAWS 3-D (1983), Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett Jr. has a giant shark to deal with in Seaworld.   In JAWS: THE REVENGE, we shall see who gets the final revenge. 'Tis Christmas season in Amity.  Sean Broady (Mitchell Anderson) is now a deputy like his father was.  He goes out on a scouting boat to investigate.  Suddenly a big shark attacks him and kills him. Michael Brody (Lance Guest) and his family arrive to comfort his mother, Ellen (Lorraine Grey).  His father died from a heart attack, but Ellen believes it was from fear of the shark.  Ellen is upset and furious.  She doesn't want anyone in the family to go near the water again.  Michael decides to take his mother to his home in the Bahamas.  As Ellen finds new assurance in Hoagie (Michael Caine), the shark is after Michael again.   Roy Scheider does not appear in this film, only a photograph.  Lorraine Grey returns in her orignial role from the first JAWS and JAWS 2.   Fritzi Jane Courtney, who appeared in JAWS and JAWS 2 makes a cameo appearance,as well as Lee Fierro as "Mrs. Kinter", the mother who lost her son in JAWS.   Fans of JAWS were unhappy with the plot of this one.  Not enough shark-biting action.  It was nice that Lorraine Grey signed on to return, but the big mistake was mentioning "Martin Brody" died previously 
 Let me preface this by saying I picked up a "Dark" series book a few years ago, as I'd heard of the author, and I do love the paranormal genre.  It was garbage.  I accidently picked up "Oceans of Fire" recently, realized who wrote it, but read it anyway, and found it above par. So, desperate for a read, skimming the stacks at the bookstore, I picked up Dark Magic.  Big mistake.  Again-garbage.  The female lead creeps me out-The classic romance 'feisty but with nothing to back it up "Don't tell me what to do, you are not the boss of me," type- then two minutes later is meek passive chick. Bah.  "I want to live my own life, leave me alone.....oh, dear you are so strong and manly, I cannot resist you!"   I am not quoting the book...just giving a feel of the dialogue.  Why do author's think a female lead that can manage to say no once or twice, or has an occasional clever retort, but actually has no backbone, is appealing?  This type of behavior went on and on and on......until, of course, the conditioning sets in, and the female lead gives up.  The male lead is the classic semi abusive control freak slash father figure who basically rapes the female lead, tells her what to do because it is for her own good, and she of course, falls right in line.  Why in hades do women readers like these type of male leads?  I absolutely loathe both of these kind of male and female characters.  The bad guys were kinda of lame, and so was the big battle against the baddy.  Save your money.  Since the Anita Blake series hit the skids about three books past, I'm starving for a good vampy paranormal. After reading this, I'm kinda barfy.      
 It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty 
 Everyone, avoid buying this book.  There are many other books out there.  As you can see on this page, one of the authors of this book tried to justify having made errors by saying other books have errors too.  He also openly admitted having made contextual errors (which is extremely embarrassing) after being pointed out by one of his customers, but the author blasted him away and made no apology about selling incorrect data due to his ignorance and stupidity.  
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much.  I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.  If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good.  It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does.  Totally not serious, but a giggle to be had here and there.  Some of which is at the author's expense 
 A rambling discourse on maps, including things which are not maps, like "mental maps".  After the first chapter, I skimmed around looking at topics  I was interested in. Some impressions:    On the History of Mapmaking: Apparently the author's son Chandler played a much bigger role than Erosthenes.    On Cartographers: Since it is mathematically impossible to map the spherical world onto a flat peice of paper with complete isometric precision, the science of Cartography has little more claim to our respect than little Chandler's drawings.    On the illustrations: Unfortunately for me, the only "beautifully illustrated" thing in the paperback edition is the cover 
 This movie is trash.  It's a sorry excuse for a home video soft porn flick, and a bad one at that.  Save your money, don't bother 
 The movie is fine, but............... There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service 
 Based upon the editors description I thought I was getting a detailed field book describing specific parts that make up as-designed M1's.  Not so.  The specific information is sketchy, it includes almost no parts photos, only low quality line drawings.  Much detail is left out and few exceptions to the general rules are mentioned.  Some of the factual information is suspect ("The round operating rod spring was the same for all manufacturers and did not change during its production life").  Personal experience with CMP issued rifles suggests this is not true.  An "OK" book for beginners, serious collecters should search out a copy of the Duff manual 
 After listening to this album a few times and settling on my opinion, I went to Amazon to see if everyone agreed.  There, I was disappointed to see that many people defended Weezer as a maturing and improving band.  The fact is, however, that this album simply very sub par next to their other albums.  In the beginning of each song, one might be led to think that that the album has a redeeming factor, as each song begins with a poppy, catchy guitar riff that one can expect from Weezer.  However, as each song progresses, it is clear that Weezer has lost their touch.  The songs are repetetive, feautring mildly catchy choruses followed by painfully tame guitar solos.  And that is not to mention the vocals.  The melodies in the singing are uncreative, and the lyrics are so uninspired, corny, and angsty that it is embarassing to listen to this music around others.  A perfect example of this disappointing song formula: Freak Me Out.  At first, the smooth, floating, mellow guitar riff is interesting and nice.  Then come the vocals.  Laaaaaame.  The lyrics are uncreative, and the chorus is straight out of an Nsync album.    The song has some catchy choruses, tunes, and riffs, namely in This is such a Pity, Hold Me, and Peace.  But Weezer is definitely not maturing, they're going stale.  It is shocking to me that anyone is willing to defend this album's cliche drenched music 
 As you can see in the picture, the pestle (the part you hold in your hand) has quite a wide bottom.  Unfortunately, this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location, making it practically impossible to grind seeds (e.g., cumin) to dust.  I tried it once on cumin seeds, and gave up 
 This series of essays may be of interest to the most serious and cerebral Buffy fans.  But Buffy was not a serious and cerebral exercise.  It was the best of campy cheeky fun.  The writers of these essays did not seem to get it.  Granted there were life lessons and moral issues.  Indeed, "The Body" may be argueably the finest 60-minutes ever broadcast on American TV.  However the "musical", "Thanksgiving", and "Xander's wedding" were meant to be a hoot.  Obviously, I was dissappointed by this book.  If someone knows a more enlightened critique of Buffy, I would like to hear about it.     
 I found this dictionary to be totally useless because it only goes one way, Arabic to English.  Which is OK unless you don't know alphabetical order in Arabic.  And for the price, you would expect it should be a two-way dictionary but it's not.  I found the Hippocrene Practical Dictionary to be much better, much cheaper, and it goes both ways (English to Arabic and Arabic to English) 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
   This is a "qualified" bad rating of this bracket because it doesn't appear to work with the XL model of the eXplorist GPS.     Just took delivery of the "Vehicle Mounting Bracket -P/N 702210" which is widely advertised to be suitable for the Magellan eXplorist GPS series.  Well, I can tell you that either something was left out of the package or more likely, this bracket is NOT suitable for use with the larger eXplorist XL GPS.  I hope someone can provide directions as to how this puppy will hold the XL GPS, but until they do (I've asked Magellan for clarification as to the suitability of this bracket with the eXplorist XL model), be very carefull if you plan to use this bracket with the larger eXplorist XL GPS.  NEXT DAY UPDATE:  Response from Magellan to my question about suitability of P/N 702210, Magellan Vehicle mounting bracket for explorist(tm) GPS, for use with eXplorist XL was to recommend that "... I request you to get the swivel mounting bracket for this unit.  ..."  I read that to mean the eXplorist XL will not work with this product.  Magellan Case #209051 pertains.  
 No wonder Stephen King did not want this to be released. This movie is stupid. The original did not need a sequel at all. We all expected better, considering this was made by Mary Mambert, who made the original Pet Sematary. This is crap, so do not buy it 
 I just completed the book, and wish I'd read the reviews from readers sooner. The errors definitely distracted from the overall experience. Unlike many of the reviewers, I purchased the book prior to a vacation to Arizona, thinking it might give me an insight into the history and flavour of the American Southwest. That it did - but to see the relationship between Dine/Navajo linked to Athapaskan-speaking people in Canada's north who fished for salmon and built totem poles .. 'Scuse me? The author mixed up the Pacific Northwest's Haida people with the inland Dene. In the chapter named 'Tombstone', the author mistakenly names Val Kilmer as an actor portraying Wyatt Earp; wrong again, Kilmer played Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell played Earp in the movie referred to. And these are just a couple of the more irritating and obvious mistakes.  It's too bad, as the material is fascinating. However, I soon began to mistrust the information 
 The delivery was quick, however the quality of the picture on most of the movies leaves a lot to be desired 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 TA is a highly sophisticated topic which cannot be covered thoroughly with a 316 page book. That's for sure. In fact, the author had been honest not to over promise with the humble title of his book. The scope of discussion is limited to chart patterns, trendlines, channels, moving averages, Fibonnaci numbers, MACD, Stochastics, RSI and a few others. As the author had emphasized his objective to make his book only an introduction to TA, I am not going to comment on the variety of TA tools covered. However, I still want to criticize on some of the weaknesses:  1) Number of real life examples/price charts are few.  2) The choice of parameters for MACD and Stochastics had not been discussed  3) False breakouts are so frequent in the author's graphs samples (that's a fact of life, I admit). However, the author made little attempt to teach readers how to avoid such traps with the use of multiple TA tools.  4) The relative weak Q&A sections that questions are focused on readers' understanding of the definition of jargons instead of the usage of TA tools.   Though the price is affordable, I am hesitant to recommend it to any aspiring trader/investor who are serious to get an elementary but quality course on TA. It's not the cost of the book that matters, but the cost of time and potential trading loss for reading it.       
 A VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  AND I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER.  THE MIXER IS INCREDIBLY LOUD --- NOT AT ALL THE QUALITY OF MY 25-YEAR-OLD KITCHENAID 
 I should start this out by saying Howard Bloom is a genuis, and I am a big fan, but that is what makes this review harder for me to write.  Everything that made The Lucifer Principle great makes Global Brain not so great. The Lucifer Principle was entertaining and easy to read. It was a rare book, one that dealt with complex ideas, but not in a way that was above the average joe. This book read like a school textbook, and one that you would read in grad school to boot. Another problem was that this book had no clear cut goals, and those it did seemed to similiar to The Lucifer Principle.  Stick with the Lucifer Principle and skip this 
 It's not my type of a french movie as it supposed to be. It is too sexually 
 Collector Books did not live up to its generally fine quality of productions in this guide to English ceramics.  The text is awkwardly written, confusing or contradictory in places, and colorless, lacking enthusiasm.  Worse, a very large number of the illustrations are seriously shadowed, a most annoying flaw in an identification guide.  On the plus side, the range and selection of objects discussed is ample, and the illustrations of marks are helpful 
 While well written this work is simply another example of historical revisionism. Not really worth the time. 
 Killsuck was an awful band from day one, but somehow they keep getting worse and worse.  If you thought their other albums were emo-laden, this makes "The End of Heartache" look like Morbid Angel's "Altars of Madness" for cryin' out loud!!  In other words, it's a metalcore album from metalcore band #391084309184230482048204830, so don't go near this and go for Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Cynic, and DRI for real metal.  Of course, my annoying little friend I Shalt Become [A C0rnh0le Victim] will give some stupid comment about how I'm "not metal" or say "durr, Krisiun is mallcore."  As usual, I'll just laugh at his stupidity and move along 
 Unfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring!  What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame.  Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says,  "This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers." If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here.  
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 If any dude buys this over the age of 15, then you're a perv. 
 I've had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted "brew and pause" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up. Also, it's hard not to spill some water on the heating plate, either during filling or brewing, creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience -- if you live in a steak house. Considering how many other coffee makers are available out there, these flaws make this machine a mistake. Too bad, because some things are done quite nicely: the controls are good and easy to set, and the overall styling is sleek, euro-cool, and compact.  Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance. Pass on this one 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I had to force myself to finish it and I usually like Cornwell. Sure am glad I didn't PAY for it (library). The characters are poorly developed, the plot is confusing and disjointed, and the overall story is unimpressive.  Don't waste your time 
 My experience with this brush has been terrible.  Well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results. ***Update, a few months later:  I didn't replace the brush.  I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then.  The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use 
 I was very disappointed with the book. The best picture is of the cover. If you like 80's design, this is the book for you 
 I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.  After waiting for this item for several weeks already, I was today told by Amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay.  I have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from Infantastic 
 In the Long Ago Far Away, I remember reading some of the Anita Blake series, but being no fan of mysteries or detectives I let the series fall by the wayside.  If a writer is truly great, then I can stay rivited even if the subject isn't one of my favorites.  I adore Faeries, to the point of practicing a post-modern version of Faerie Faith with no rules and no boundaries (and hence no obsessive traditionalism).  Ms. Hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  Yet somehow, this is the inverse of liberating.  Oh, I am not surprised.  I have something of a fetish for well-written negative reviews, and reading some of the erudite, articulate attacks on Ms. Hamilton's writing have been illuminating.  I am fully aware of the direction taken by Anita Blake and I knew to expect it with Meredith Gentry.  So essentially, mixed blood fairy girl (1/2 Unseelie, 1/4 Seelie Brownie, 1/4 mortal - or some approximation of that mess) without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the Queen of the Unseelie Court, her Aunt Andais.  She becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.  Auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward Princess Meredith and bring her back to the Court, where the Queen will make Merry an Offer She Can't Refuse.  Part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the Queen's Guards until she conceives, because a child will guarantee Merry the Throne.  Merry's competing with her cousin, Cel, who is under the same orders to produce a child.  And that's about it.  From some of the reviews here, I expected a lot more sex.  There are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes, but they're nothing special.  The kink quotient is quite mild, comparatively speaking.  Even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing.  It seems that, if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way, Meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute, in the most contrived way possible.  Merry, apparently, doesn't take any for the team.  The most diffecult thing about reading Laurell Hamilton is the way she writes.  Her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious.  Whenever someone bites/something stabs Meredith, the pain is described as "sharp and immediate."    "Burning and instantaneous" "Terrible and abrupt" "Stinging and urgent"  I'm not even trying.  Along with this limited vocabulary, Ms. Hamilton writes very much in passive voice.  Is, was, were, has, had, be, been, etc.  Dialogue is also stilted and awkward, with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something "witty."  Characterization isn't a strong suit either.  Meredith is a little dull, but most heroines are.  Her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities, and I wish there had been some variety in the way Ms. Hamilton chose to describe them, rather than a run-down of features and attributes.  So why did I read it?  If I knew all this in advance, why did I even drop a dime on it?    I enjoy erotica, and, as previously mentioned, I'm a faerie fan.  I expected the writing to be terrible, but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment.  Then I expected to come here, slap down a single star, and go on my merry way.  If at all possible, I am even more offended by the fact the most of Ms. Hamilton's ideas were good, but she blew it by not following through, or by failing to explore character emotion, or by making the plot secondary to the sex.  To have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all (Anne Rice's "Beauty" series, *cough*cough).  But I can't give Ms. Hamilton one star, because the ideas were there, shining just below the surface.  The idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world . . . the concept of a fairie exodus to the United States . . . old gods becoming fairies . . . etc, etc . . .  So the book gets two stars, and it could have garnered more if Ms. Hamilton had her priorities straight.  1. Ms. Hamilton, you are a grown woman.  Mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please.  Obscuring gential terms with "him" and "himself" makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself.  If you want to write something with a little heat and intensity, clarify the act, please.  2. Thesaurus.  3. If you want all the sex, make the non-sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot.  4. Why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual, and horrified at the idea of homosexuality?  These are fairies, not humans.  Why would they possess our prejudices?  5. Let Meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again.  Refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob.  Enough complaining.   Look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into.  I've started the second book, but after the first "sharp and immediate" there, I've set it aside until my annoyance ends.  If you want a modern fairy tale, try "Tithe."  It's considered YA, but it's far more satisfying than Merry Gentry's world. 
 This entire novel was devoted to characters walking around wondering why the sky is dark all the time. If your looking for something to happen look elsewhere. It's strange that the author writes in the back of the book that she has to extend the series by another novel, since 80% of this easily could have been cut. Almost as big a let down as George RR Martins exact same excuse in his new novel, a book we all waited around 5 years for only to discover 700 pages worth of everyone's least favorite characters doing nothing. There is one major downfall in both these new works and that it extremely lacks in events taking place and instead heavily leans on boring diatribe from characters we are already tired of 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 I got this as a Christmas gift and was rather shocked. I thought it was a large boxed set, with nine discs, based on the description here. But it is actually six episodes on three discs from all over the Shadow's history. I love the episodes, that's not the issue, that product description needs to be changed.   The Episodes that are in this collection are as follows:  The Caverns of Death 9-11-38 *** Orsen Welles & Margot Stevenson A so-so episode about a cavern, and some death. Not really up to par with the best Shadow fair.  Gun Island 10-23-38 **** Bill Johnstone & Agnes Moorehead A fantastic episode with pirates and patriotism. This episode is worth it just to watch the political soft shoing they had to do in those days. I love the Bill Johnstone Shadow years just because of the political atmosphere and the scary things their writers cooked up.  Hypnotic Death 2-12-39 ***** Bill Johnstone & Marjorie Anderson I always love episodes when Cranston/Allard has to face a fow with hypnotic powers.  Friend of Darkness 2-19-39 *** Bill Johnstone & Marjorie Anderson A wonderful PSA on seeing eye dogs.  Evil In the House 11-7-48 Bret Morrison & Grace Matthews  Until Death Do Us Part 3-6-49 Bret Morrison & Grace Matthews  Based on the product, I give it *****. Based on Amazon's greatly missleading discription I give it ** 
 If you buy this book you need a performance modification on your head.  There is nothing in here that will help with performance.  Every project states no real performance gain or n/a.  I'm sure you don't need a book to tell you to upgrade your audio system or replace your brake pads and rotors or what wax to buy please.  I can not beleive this book was even aloud to be published. If I go on I will start using bad words so trust me save your money and watch a performance show on the speed channel.  Enough said. 
 Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads "Tell No One." Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.   I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end 
 I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.   Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.    Cons:  In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.  Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).  The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.   Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.  The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.   After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.  Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.  So would I recommend this camera: If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere 
 A totally worthless piece of garbage 
 OMG, this movie sucks ASS. The guy who acts like Eminem sucks, the special effects suck and everything else. The guy at the end who is the main bad guy is horrible. It looked like they attatched cotton balls to his eyebrows to make him look like a hoot owl (I dunno). For you sake and your unborn children's sake don't watch this movie or they'll come out with brain damage 
 Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs) 
 I needed to have this book for class and it is so boring. I can only read a page before I just have to stop because it's just that dull 
 It is obvious from the responses here that this is simply a replication of the book in audio form.  I found myself mislead on the "Part II" on the cover - buyer beware 
     The editor of this volume of collected essays,U Maki,made the mistake of republishing an error filled paper of J.Runde that originally appeared as an invited paper in The Monist(1995).Runde corrected several of his errors regarding Frank Knight,but none of his errors regarding John Maynard Keynes.Runde's essay is then used ,implicitly and/or explicitly,by the other essay authors whenever issues about Keynes and probability,decision making,rationality,expectations,etc.,arises as an issue in their essays.Runde's major error is that he bases his entire discussion of Keynes's approach to the quantification and measurement of probabilities  on chapters 3  and 4 of Keynes's A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP).This is precisely the same error made by Frank P. Ramsey, in 1922 and 1926, in two error filled reviews  of Keynes's book that Bertrand Russell correctly described as having the least value of any paper written by Ramsey during his brief lifetime(1903-1930).In chapter 3 of the TP,p.37,Keynes warns the reader that his approach to the measurement and quantification of estimating probabilities would not be completed until after Part II of the TP had been finished.In chapter 15(pp.160-163) and chapter 17(p.186-194)of his TP,Keynes makes it crystal clear that by the terms "nonnumerical" and "nonmeasurable" he means not by a single numeral(number)but by TWO numerals.Keynes is the founder of the interval approach to probability.This is directly contrary to Runde's claim that Keynes's theory is strictly a qualitative (comparative)approach involving the use of ordinal rankings,combined with some very special cases of numerical measurement involving frequencies and applications of  Keynes's principle of indifference.This would make Keynes's theory inoperative in the real world of actual decision making.Fortunately,Ramsey and Runde are wrong.For Keynes,it is the intervals themselves,if they overlap in any way, which are incomparable,nonrankable,and incommensurable.A simple example is to take the two probability interval estimates [.3,.5] and [.4,.6].These two probabilities can't be ranked or compared.They are "nonnumerical" probabilities.Runde wastes the reader's time by presenting diagrams purporting to represent intervals without the use of any numbers. This conception has absolutely nothing to do with the approach to probability estimation presented in 1921 by Keynes in his TP.We can now summarise Keynes's approach. All probabilities are either point estimates ,involving single numbers, or they are interval estimates, involving two numbers.These latter proabilities can be called nonadditive,imprecise or indeterminate probabilities,as long as the Bayesian interpretation of imprecise is not imputed to Keynes.In chapter 26 of the TP,Keynes incorporated his interval estimate approach into a method for technically dealing with expectations and decision theory.Keynes presented his conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.The goal of the decision maker is to maximize cA,as opposed to pA,expected value or pU(A),expected utility.c=p(1/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)].Both c and w,which measures the completeness of the potential and actual amount of relevant evidence upon which the decision maker will base his calculation of an estimated probability,are normalized on the unit interval [0,1].Naturally,one will obtain a lower bound and an upper bound when using the c coefficient formula.This would then lead to a "nonnumerical" weighted value and/or "nonnumerical" mathematical expectation or expected value.All of this ,however,is omitted in both Ramsey and Runde.The lesson to be learned is that papers should be carefully examined for errors by editors before they are accepted for publication.The only possible reason for purchasing this book would be if a potential reader wanted to compare the original 1995  Runde article with Runde's 2001 contribution in this volume and see if any learning from experience has occurred.My own opinion is that the reader would be better off just reading chapters 15 and 17 of the TP 
 Monture taught me his rendition of brain-tanning and 'traditional' beadwork.  I have learned authentic Traditional beading not only from Barth's book, "Native American Beadwork: Traditional Beading Techniques for the Modern-Day Beadworker", but from working with traditional Native beadworkers and hide tanners.  Monture's book is truely a romanticized version of yesteryear surely to captivate the heart of a non-traditional "indigenous wannabe".  An educated guess; One cannot write about things that one does not know.  Nice try anyway 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 Our daughter has weak muscles and I wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy. I saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears.  NOT!  It did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us.    
 When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo 
 One reviewer of this book said that this book was a "recipe for appeasement" and that were the world to recommend genocide, or a return to slavery, that this book would imply that this ought to be America's policy!  Well, is that reviewer right about this book?  After reading the book, I think the reviewer is right.    The author makes the point that opponents of the United States try to delegitimize us.  He's right; they do.  But the response to this ought to be to do what is best, not to appease our enemies.  Appeasement generally makes matters worse for everyone.  I think if we have the ability to support truth, justice, human rights, peace, and prosperity, we ought to do so, even if it may sometimes mean battling thugs and tyrants.  The portion of this book that I'm best able to judge is about Israel.  I'm a Pagan and a Zionist.  And the author does a bad job of describing America's informal alliance with Israel.  He somewhat exaggerates the strength of the Israeli lobby here, and in addition, he makes it appear somewhat sinister, as if it were causing America to support policies that are against our own interests.  In fact, it is very difficult for small nations to convince us to act against our interests.  It is far easier for small nations to agree to do what we say (in an attempt to become or remain our allies) or for small nations to benefit from getting our support when America's enemies attack them.  Yes, the Israeli lobby has done well, but the main reason for this is that it has an excellent product to sell!  Israel is a nation which is being attacked by some reactionary and racist thugs and tyrants.  The nation most slandered by the United Nations and the international community is Israel.  No wonder plenty of decent people find it easy to support it.  The Israeli lobby isn't needed to convince most American opponents of all this slander and aggression.  Walt does not mention any of this, of course.  There is a big difference between being in favor of human rights for all and supporting all policies of the State of Israel.   Walt certainly agrees.  But he implies that American Zionists tend to support the latter, not the former.  And that's not true at all.  There's plenty of opposition by Zionists to specific Israeli policies, and it is an anti-Zionist untruth to say that one can't object to Israeli government policies without running afoul of the Zionist lobby.  Such excuses are often used by those who deny Israel's right to exist (presumably in order to deny human rights to Levantine Jews) and then try to say that they merely disagree with some policies of the Israeli government.  In addition, Walt fails to discuss the extent to which some American Jews disagree not only with Israeli policies, but even with the idea that Israeli Jews ought not be denied human rights.  Walt implies that Israel wants "to impose an unjust solution unilaterally" to its dispute with the Arabs.  That's ridiculous.  If there is peace, Israel wins: it gets to stay on the map and prosper on land it is making excellent use of.   That's why Israel is willing to put up with a solution which cheats the Jews out of land they would otherwise be entitled to keep or purchase.  It is anything but unjust to the Arabs to let Israel have less than its fair share of land!  Or to allow human rights for all the people of the region!  The author also comes up with the taunt that denying Arabs "their legitimate political rights has not made Israel safer."  That's outrageous.   There is no legitimate right to dissolve a neighboring nation and get rid of the human rights of its people.  And it does not make one "safer" to agree to get rid of one's human rights, quite the contrary.  He's simply blaming Israel for the aggression and slander against it.  At one point, Walt even asks "why should other Arabs believe that the United States is committed to freedom when its money and power are used to deny these rights to millions" of Levantine Arabs.  Well, I think that there are plenty of flaws with American foreign policy.   However, in my opinion, we deserve quite a bit of praise for supporting human rights in the Levant.  We could do better.  But if we take the author's advice, we'll be doing much, much worse.  I do not recommend this book. 
 After Linda (the author) ties up her mare, and it struggles to the point of dropping in exhaustion, the rope cutting off the mare's airway, she ...  "found a small knife in the tack room and began cutting the rope that had subjected my troubled mare to this trauma, one I had set in motion seemingly with the best intentions. For the next week, she could barely walk, and when she was well enough to ride again, she had even less tolerance for the hitching post."  DUH!!!! This passage is found on page 11.  So, it was the rope's fault? And you could not be blamed because you had the "best intentions"? How stupid is this woman? She blindly took the quack advice given to her. Anyone with a modicum of horse sense knows you never tie up a horse like this. EVER.  How could tying up your horse and letting it panic as it tries to escape so it will submit to you be the "best intentions"?  I can't finish this book. Thank goodness this book showed its absurdity early on so I would not be subjected to reading more of it 
 I washed this quilt on a very delicate cycle, brand new, so that I could use it and when I took it out of the washing machine, it looked like it went through a paper shredder.  I am very disappointed.  This was a gift and I am not sure what I am going to tell the person who bought it for us now.  
 I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers.  The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute 
 This is a miserable book.  A few minutes in, it has a description of meat running with blood, then shortly later a detailed description of a botched, brutal slaughter of a baby lamb.  That's when I tossed the book into the rubbish pile.  I'd give it negative stars if that were possible, it certainly doesn't deserve even one star 
 This was a less than stellar sequal to The Women of the Silk but it did finish the story of Pei to some extent.  I found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believabl 
 not worth the money.  Should have read the credits - one star is too a high rating for this terrible imitation of the original film. I   recommend it to no one. 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 If my eleventh grade son had written this book, I would have given it a D-.  When Rashid Khalidi write it, it gets a triple F.  The logic is not there, the facts are wrong.  Can't Palestinians do more than hate Israelis? 
 Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets 
 I saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you!  However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one 
 theres nothing wrong in making thought provoking lyrics but man if this isn't watered down rap or what?.theres some tracks on here don't get me wrong but damn its too comercial for me 
 Absent of any quality.  Throughly disappointing.  All the Naxos Sherlock series is without ANY redeeming valu 
 I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me.  The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.    It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way.  People are smashing through stone walls a lot.   The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.  Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie.  Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.  I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma.   I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy 
 The subtitle of this book is "A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Rich." That's a bold statement. Instead of a 9-step plan from Suzie Orman, here we have a one-step plan. So it goes, just do this one thing and you are golden. It turns out there is more than just one step, but the gist of the book is that you should pay yourself first, i.e. setting up automatic payroll deduction and electronic fund transfers for saving, investing, and debt reduction. I'm all for that, even though that idea is nothing new. All 401k plans work this way. There's not much secret in personal finance. So don't expect a magic wand that fixes everything without any sacrifice.  The book says his plan requires "no budget, no discipline, less than ten dollars a day of investment." If only it were that easy! It still requires commitment and re-prioritization. When you want to buy a plasma TV and you don't have money, do you stop your automatic savings or do you forego that TV? Paying yourself first requires commitment. It means you won't be able to have as many nice dinners as you want or do today. It means you won't have leather seats in your car but settle for regular cloth seats. There's no way around that. Automate however you want. At the end of the day, you have to cut your spending. If your spending doesn't come down, you won't be able to continue on your auto-pilot for too long.  The book also gives the illusion that you don't have to save much in order to retire rich. The "less than ten dollars a day" part is totally misleading. Investing $10 a day at 5% after inflation for 40 years gets you about $18,500 a year in retirement income before tax. Not bad, but I don't think anybody can call it Finish Rich if you retire on $18,500 a year. If someone is not saving any money at all, saving $10 a day is better than nothing and we all have to start somewhere. If you really want to Finish Rich, $10/day is not going to cut it. Later in the book the author said you should save 10-15% of your income for retirement. That's a lot better. Saving and investing $7,500 a year on a $50k income at 5% after inflation for 40 years will generate $38,000 a year in retirement income. But that's 40 years. If you want to retire in 30 years, your investments can only generate $21,000 a year. Don't expect that you will be like Jim and Sue McIntyres in the book, at age 52 having two homes paid off free and clear, two kids in college, and a $1 million investment portfolio. I'm sorry to burst the dream, but saving 15% on $50,000 income for 30 years is not going to get you there. It will get you somewhere, a lot farther than where you otherwise would be, but Finishing Rich will require more sacrifice than that.  This book is more on the inspirational side than on the information side, for example his suggestion on bi-weekly mortgage payments is plain bad advice. You should pay off all high rate credit cards and car loans and contribute the maximum allowed to your 401k and Roth IRA before you even consider paying extra on your mortgage. For people who are spending everything they earn and then some, it motivates people toward saving and investing in their 401k plans and Roth IRAs. That's great, even if the numbers don't necessarily add up. If that gets people started on saving for retirement, more power to David Bach! If you are reading other Personal Finance books or blogs, you are probably already contributing to your 401k and Roth IRA. You are not going to gain much insight from this book. David Bach is living proof that a motivational seminar host can package anything into warm and fuzzy book series, workbooks, audio tapes, and live seminars with heavy marketing. People don't want to hear that saving for retirement requires real sacrifices. This book gives them exactly that.  Final verdict: 2-stars, Fair, skip, you won't miss anything 
 This book might be the worst book I have read in years. Susan Roane has filled 240 pages with more or less obvious information like OAR approach. Observe, Ask a Question, Reveal your Thought. I don't wanna spend much time on reviewing this book, but I'll tell you: If you expect something that analyzes, refers to any scientific papers (or any stuidies at all) or puts any psychological aspects in the mix, then forget this book 
 If you're looking for historical accuracy, you're not going to find it in this movie. First I'll touch on the good parts.  The Native people in the film are generally portrayed well. Some artistic freedom was taken with costuming (especially in regards to the women) however the language, customs, and spirituality are portrayed fairly accurately. Also, I would commend the, "spirit," of the movie. All in all, it tried very hard to show Native people in a very positive light -- and that is good.  However, the movie was filled with absolute nonsense from a historical perspective. First, portraying the Pilgrims as such sympathetic characters almost made me vomit. These are the people who praised God for wiping out the, "heathen devil-worshipers," to make way for their, "city on a hill." If the Pilgrims hadn't been starving and freezing to death, they would've just as soon shot all the Native people to death.  The true Tisquantum (Squanto) kept the dying English alive. He likely didn't do it for peace. He probably did it to save his own skin. Europeans were wreaking havoc with Native populations from Canada to Florida, causing uprisings and wars and pitting tribes against one another. It was profitable for Europeans to see Native tribes kill each other. Tisquantum had no village left, and he faced being captured and assimilated into another tribe, or just killed outright. The Pilgrims had muskets. It was a matter of opportunity. The Pilgrims just happened to settle in the right place at the right time.  The scenes depicting Squanto communicating with animals was way over-the-top. Native spirituality is compelling enough without introducing that nonsense. It was totally unnecessary. It's pure, unadulterated, Disney hoo-ha.  There is much more garbage in this movie, but I think I've said enough.  Please -- I beg of you -- if you watch this movie with your children, PLEASE make sure they know this is NOT a historical drama. It is FICTION. It didn't happen this way. Learn the true story of Tisquantum and the real history behind the, "First Thanksgiving," and teach it to your children 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 then this isn't for you. Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee, this isn't the one to try 
 I can't believe I read the same book as all of these other people.  Here's what I want to know.  How long did it take Ms. Denay to write this garbage?  Between all the pages of quotes and insets on every page oh, and don't forget the the sixteen pages in the back where the "quoter" is bio-ed, she barely wrote a 10th grade level essay.  I'm a mother of 5 kids, the oldest 14 and I never needed anyone to tell me not to wear sweatpants and maybe comb my hair once in while if I want my husband to still find me attractive. No kidding Ms. Denay, I should make time for my husband AND my kids? Gee, I never thought of that one.  How profound. I would also hope every mom out there doesn't need to be told to "dance" with their kid once in while and I don't mean just to music. Celebrating your children should come naturally or you've got bigger problems than Ms. Denay's handbook is gonna be able to solve. I thought I was going to read something smart and edgy.  Boy, was I disappointed. you have to be the most pathetic mom in the world to be inspired by this book! Want to be a "hot mom" save the purchase price of the book and order some pizza for your family.  Oh, and don't forget to wipe the schmutz off of your face and look presentable.  It's amazing how much I learned from this book. In conclusion, tell me somthin' I don't already know 
 Filled with lots of opinion unsubstantiated by facts (although much of it probable true) and very redundant...about five pages in the whole book actually worth reading and that information can be had many places in the financial press.  A waste of my money and time 
 I got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand 
 Some of the articles are well written but others are very repetitious and not rich in analysis.  They are usually very short, and chould have been developed more. @More careful analysis needed.  They also use a lot of  "I's" in their writing.  They emphasize a lot on their own  experience, not what others think.  Not really academically written.   Some  authors just repeat the same thing over and over again, which makes the  whole book dull.  One advantage is that it is easy to read 
 This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.  And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product.  
 This text is absolutely inadequate in the gastrointestinal physiology area for the level it proposes to teach.  They really need to get someone who understands this area to help them out 
 This was a very disappointing product.  Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product.  It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it.  It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood.  There goes the portability of it!  VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
 Very bad.... Nothing good inside. All are below average photos. Don't waste your money 
 The book could be subtitled "Look at Me, I'm a Zen Rebel".  It's annoying and tedious.  Not suprising when someone who's job it is to make you believe you need stuff you don't tries to sell you on his enlightenment.  Better to try "Triumph of the Sparrow: Zen Poems of Shinkichi Takahashi" 
 I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day 
 If you've never read any well written and insightful books on technology adoption (such as Lewis Mumford's "Technics and Civilization") then perhaps parts of "The Change Function" may appear profound.  However if you had, then this text will find you wishing you had spent your time and money elsewhere.    People won't use technology that's hard to use? Profound.  People only learn a new way to drive to work when the old route is under construction? Brilliant.  Coburn goes way out on a limb to predict what technology will succeed...are you ready? Flat screen technology and Blackberries (mobile enterprise email). The man is a psychic.   On top of the lack of anything remotely fresh in this book, reading The Change Function is a bit like reading a version of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations; except the people being quoted are not familiar to you...unless you are one of Pip's blog friends, who receive endless attributions throughout the book.    Please save your time and money. Re-read Telecosm (Gilder) with an eye for how so many actual predictions (not like Coburn's Monday-morning QB stlye) were wrong.    BTW - I predict hybrid cars will be big in the future 
 A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books 
 Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes 
 I leafed through this book in a store and was impressed by the workout.  I carefully analzyed the programme and attempted to do the  routine.  Although I found the workout solid and logical, it was very rigid.  My body recovered at different stages and i found it very confusing to stay on target.  I was often faced with being too sore to do this part of the workout but not the other.  Delaying the sore parts a day would impact future workouts to the point that I could not keep the workout on track.  You would be left with too much or too little to do on a given day because you were monitoring your body's recovery.  After a couple months, I gave up on the book.  If you do not do the workout in the book, it has little reference value 
 I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good.  This was not one of them.  Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley).  The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look".  If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity 
 Kerr's much beloved (so they say), Devarrey series focuses on the plight of Aberwayn with the loss of Rhys and the kidnapping od Rhodry. Strange that I found myself rooting for the bad guys here. Maybe it's the unusual way in which Kerr writes....long flashback sequences, that always end the same way, Brangwen (Jill) is not yet ready to embrace her true calling, and Nevyn must soldier on till the next incarnation. The problem with this idea is twofold, one, the romance between Brangwen and Galrion was never really fleshed out in book one, leaving Nevyn's punishment by the Gods for his supposed transgressions a little baffling. And that leaves us with the great romance between Jill and Rhodry, where if one dies the other would feel the loss...ect. But, Jill was to marry Galrion, and in other incarnations she and Rhodry are mistress and servant, brothers in arms ect so that we don't care about their great love affair, after all it's only another incarnation, one of maybe dozens they have already had. The best part of this book is when Lord Perryn seduces Jill, in this instance I found Jill to be more than just a cookie cutter acolyte waiting to learn her craft and become a master....here she became both victim and heroine...and as such became a more interesting character. The story however, plods on and on, with only flashes that Nevyn has limitations, or that this Brotherhood will become a least a close match for his powers. Readers be warned, there is no map attached to this book, and the many place names get real confusing after a while...so keep one of her other books at hand. With really nowhere to go but the completion of Jill's wyrd, and the eventual passing of the torch to her, Nevyn, the best character here is as hamstrung as the story itself...and there are many, many volumes yet to go 
 "Catholicism frightens me ... enrages me", writes the author. Now if I claimed to be a practicing Catholic, as other reviewers might, I would think twice about selling out my opinions without any substantive argument. C'est la vie, objectionable reviews are duly culled by well-meaning Jewish-leaning editors. The ones that remain look positively tame next to the editorial reviews above. I certainly hope that the author and her slavish fans can some day grow up into mature, responsible people. Chill 
 Now what, .... I have saved all my data in some unknown scrambled format and can't do anything about it. I was hoping for a storage device that would give me the option of recognizing what I saved and being able to change what needs to be changed at a time when I feel it's necessary. Now I have to wait till doomsday arrives when I have to reinstall all my unidentifiable scrambled files? Way to much money for nothing!   
 if your looking for something that you can rock to, like KMFDM, PIG, or slick idiot, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD! Musically it is way different then what i was hoping for. There is a variety of musical styles on here, non of which is good rockin industrial. So if you don't mind different, buy it, you'll like it, just don't expect much otherwise 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat. 
 James Horner has the reputation as a fine composer of film music, but he can also easily be placed in with John Williams, et. al. in the gamut of "film composers who blatantly borrow from classical music composers."  Williams is primo facto enemy no. 1, but Horner has been known to dip into the 19th century music barrel from time to time for ideas.  Alas, the soundtrack to "Willow" is one of these times.  As well as the music works in the film, and I believe does, this reviewer just cannot get over the similarity between the 'Escape fromt the Tavern" theme and the third movement of Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony.  One would hope that he was not "phoning" this score in, but I cannot imagine I'm the only one to make this connection 
 The information is not organized in a user-friendly manner.  I bought this guide and the Lonely Planet, and basically did not use the Rough Guide because it's not differentiated by category 
 This is an atrocious book.  The author's "professional job search" is an excuse to trash career counselors, fat people, and Christians--people that, judging from the prejudicial attitudes expressed in this book--Barbara despises, with a capital D.  Despite her lazy job search and a faked resume--I question her ethics--Ms. Holier-Than-Thou found two jobs.  Wasn't that the whole point? As one reader below notes, she turned them down because they weren't good enough for her. She clearly has her private demons, and "professional level work" may be one of them.    Barbara's book makes me think that she must be extremely insecure.  She doesn't want anyone to think she is less than competent.  Maybe that's why she rejects help, lashes out, criticizes others, and refuses two job offers.  Insecurity.    I wanted her to take one of the two jobs she was offered, or find something good enough for her.  But she chose to do neither.  This is a book about how hard it was for poor old (sniff!) Barbara to find a job.  Brace yourself for boredom and anger.  Maybe she would have been better off in a self-help group. Spare us, Barbara!    
 I remember this movie back in the 70's as being much, much funnier. I bought it. I saw it and I will never watch it again. It is in the give away pil 
 Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them 
 I borrowed a copy of this book from my sister once. Now she thinks it silly above all else, but I, being a second degree Pagan, was frightened at what Mr. Ridenour says in his work, frightened that Biblical Christianity is indeed the right religion after all, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  And that is how he wants his readers to respond.  This is a book that strives to undermine reason, to assault knowledge, and to convert people who otherwise would become better people following a different faith. If a Muslim fundamentalist were writing this book, it would turn out exactly the same way, excepting that everything would be compared to fundamental Islam, not fundamental Christianity. Mark Twain was absolutely right when he noted that "Man is the only animal that has the true religion, several of them." The sooner Mr. Ridenour realizes these things, the better off he will be spiritually.  But this book should be censored. It would be better for the public's spiritual health not to feel threatened by Mr. Ridenour's argument and his tone.  And, besides, he gives Christianity a bad name 
 if you're looking for the basic garage or outbuilding book this is not it....too big , too contemporary.... also it should be called the garage plan sourcebook. as there are no actual plans...just source 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I don't even know where to begin.  Like the reviewer Charlie, I too am wondering about the convent Winner came out of.   Instead of ways to avoid sex, one ought to consider getting married and enjoying sex the way it was meant to be enjoyed.  Parts of the book were just strange. I for one got nothing out of it 
 Don't be fooled. This is a purely pedantic and priggish book about Las Vegas. Not worth your time 
 It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)  The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL "FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004! 
 I will be succint:  This book is absolutley worthless.  Do not buy it unless you want to feel as ripped-off as I do 
 Poor quality little buds. I just bought them for the rubber "earhugger" piece to be used with other phones 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 I thought I might be able to recapture some of the original pleasure of watching the Cavett shows, but I was terribly wrong. In contrast to the wit he seemed when I was a kid, he now seems like a witless dolt. His jokes are not funny, his questions not perceptive, and he constantly steps all over his guests' attempts to utter pointless gibberish. The DVD notes make a fool out of Sly Stone, and I expected the worst, but compared to the rest of the numbskulls, and to Cavett himself, Sly comes off rather sensibly. It's hardly necessary to ridicule Sly for drug use when Cavett has raved about the wonderful effects of his own electroshock treatments. Interviews of semi-literate musicians by a shallow, self-obsessed host do not make for pleasurable viewing 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 I have to agreee whole-heartedly with the negatice reviwes of this book.  Not a great follow-up to the first installment.  Stokes' character is laughable as is the "bad guy".  I got about 100 pages into it and could care less what was going to happen on 101 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Although the writing is competent, the story could have been written as a short story.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting a psychological thriller in the tradition of Spider or Butcher Boy.  I found this to be a simple exercise in an overly long dramatic monologue.  
 I rented the film version of "A Home at the End of the World" shortly after catching the "The Hours" on cable. I was pretty impressed with both. My guess was that "The Hours" had the kind of budget and richness to capture the book, whereas "A Home..." was a small independent film that had more handicaps. I figured the book on which it was based would be a better introduction to Cunningham, because it had a better shot at being stronger than the film. Well, sometimes the film is better....  The film really centers on Bobby and Jonathan. The book includes all of the main characters as narrators and has an overlapping narrative structure. Because of this, the book fleshes out the female characters better and we see why Jonathan's mother was cast with Cissy Spacek rather than someone who seemed Midwestern and why Jonathan's father was so remote. Bobby's character has more sides, although the result is that he is less vivid than Colin Ferrell's portrayal. The three-dimensionality in the book is probably more realistic, but the film version of Bobby captures better that which is important--his odd mix of emotional distance, engagement, adaptability and ambiability. Beyond his sexual orientation, Jonathan doesn't emerge very strongly in either medium.  The book oddly does worse in setting the time and place than the film. I grew-up in the Cleveland of the 60s and 70s and made many trips to New York in the 80s. Neither place fares well in the book. Cleveland was in approaching its nadir--an unhip place beginning a long economic decline, yet also a place with vibrant music scene (that attracted many future "names" for their early tours), racial tension, and the residue of various European ethnic cultures and rivalries---in other words, it had atmosphere and it was a good launching pad to go someplace more "hip". The book protrays a generic place that is more like the inland, second or third string cities of the Midwest--places like Columbus or Fort Wayne that are big on Babbitry and bragging about their chain restaurants. New York also seems oddly unlike itself. The New York of the book's era was filled with menace--crime, fear of crime, grafitti-filled subways, filth, and a general sense of dysfunction, as well as the kind of energy, vitality, and avant garde spirit that have always drawn people to the City. The book could have taken place in the tiny bohemian quarter of Atlanta or some other provincial backwater, for all it matters. The gay world of the book's time also is lacking--it takes place at beginning of the age of AIDS and the end of libertine gay liberation. Yet, talk of AIDS is muted beyond the early denial of its presence and Jonathan has to be most sexless gay man in queer lit. Popular music plays a big role in the book, but Cunningham seems to have drawn a random selection from hits lists of the 70s, rather than combinations of music that fit in time or that would have appealed to a common audience. Although Cunningham grew-up in this era, he clearly participated rather little in the popular culture of it.  The story proceeds like the movie, with the addition of Erich, Jonathan's  bartender "boyfriend" (the relationship is undefined and mysterious to both of them). Toward the end of the book, Erich seems to be more of a plot device than a real person. The other characters take care of him as he convalesces, but with an odd lack of commitment.   Few films or books are made about menage a trois relationships and fewer films ask us to buy Collin Ferrell as a twentysomething virgin. Yet, the book came off as something far less than the film. The odd semi-sexual bond between Bobby and Jonathan was believable in the film but not in the book. Cissy Spacek took a truncated script and a thankless role in the film and communicated more about the mother's story than what we get in the book, despite the greater backstory. The film does better without Erich and without the coyness about Jonathan's HIV status. I wish I could have given the book as many stars as most of the other reviews, but by the time I finished, I just was glad that the story had ended 
    Michael Flatley's feet fly like a racehorse, but he is really a one trick pony. Now, if you like that one trick, you will like this (and every other) cd,and stageshow of his. If you are looking for something new, a progression of creativity, and expression, look elsewhere.    When Riverdance first appeared, I was a fan of the inovative blending of Broadway, traditional Irish step dancing, and new age mysticism. And The talent of all involved is undeniable.    But after other troops appear imitating the idea,and doing so almost as well. You must wonder why this artist deserves the loyalty of consumers buying the same , repackaged material over and over again.     Darwin would say that those things that don't evolve and adapt will become extinct. Unfortunately, it appears to be a slow lumbering death,for the thundering feet of this dinosaur 
 Very poor, low quality 2nd rate models, way below expectation 
 This guy is hyped by DG to gain entracne into Chinese market. Either he does not know the reportoir, or he is faking.  I give minus five, that is -5, for listening experience and -100 for spending money. Stay away from this dude. DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy.  Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless 
 I found the book another rehash of the same theme: customers aren't all the same, so you can't just push advertising at them anymore. Okay, okay, we know that already.   The authors seem enamored with complex and unnecessary terminology, which I found tedious. the book is full of terms like "persuasion architecture," "business topology," "modalities," and "personas," to name a few. I guess the more jargon you can use, the more you can charge. If that is what you are looking for, then it's a great book.  Remember geometry class and all those tedious proofs you had to go through, step by step. I could intuit the answers so had little patience for proofs. That's what this book reminded me of. In all it seemed to me to be an overly complex paint-by-numbers approach. Even so, it just *approaches* the subject but never really gets there. You can identify all the modalities and develop all the personas you want, but without the creavity to turn that information into compelling marketing, it doesn't help anything except the consultants' bottom lines.   I kept expecting the "real meat" of the book to come, but it never did for me. Perhaps it's because I'm already knowledgeable on the subject. With such a clever title, I hoped there might be some nuggets, but I found none. Some good ways to explain some issues to clients, but that's about it.   
 The book is worthless.  It was extremely high level and should have been  titled "configuring windows 2000 server security for dummies".   This book is not for anyone with Security or W2K experience....move one and  don't waste your time or money 
 This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.  However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.  Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use 
 If you learn by doing, this book is not for you. I have recently gone from PSE 2.0 to PSE 5.0 and really needed to learn the new features. When I bought PSE 2.0, I also bought "50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques". It was a wonderful book. It included a CD of photos used by the book, so the reader could start with the original photo and follow the book step-by-step to end up with the final image. The book showed the "before" and "after" and all of the steps in between. That is what I had in mind when I purchased this book. What a letdown. Some of the sample pictures that this book uses are available at their website, but the book does not indicate when to use their picture and specifically which sliders to manipulate and to what value to obtain the final result. So it does little more than explain what each of the features do. You can sit on your couch and read it. No `real-world' applications. Don't waste your money on this one 
 Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about over Penman.  This book was underwhelming in a number of catergories.    For example, the main character Justin de Quincy is two-dimensional and unrealistic.  After spending over 300 pages with this character, I feel I know very little about him, and what I do know is somewhat of a contradiction.  Whilst de Quincy is loyal to his queen, he has no loyality to the woman that carries his child.  Not only does de Quincy cheat on the pregnant woman, he doesn't even think twice about it.  Meanwhile, his sense of duty to his queen and stedfast loyality to her are constantly apparent throughout the story.  The point is, it is very hard to believe a character who is a loyal professional, but doesn't have the slightest bit of regret by living an amoral personal life.    The second issue I have with this novel is the mystery itself.  'Dragon's Lair' has so much potential in this arena, but falls flat time and time again.  The basic premise of trying to find the queen's ransom is appealing, but the way in which the crime unfolds is anti-climatic.  Moreover, the murder in this book does not occur until after page 200 of a 320 page book!    Dialogue is another major issue here.  When murder finally occurs it announced by a character declairing 'there's been murder done!' - for me, that was a laugh out loud moment.  Do people really talk that way?  de Quincy's lover constantly says silly things like 'goodbye lover!' and 'thank you lover'.  Again, people don't talk that way, and I found it very annoying having to read dialogue that was continuously unrealistic.   Lastly, although this book is historical in nature, there was hardly anything historical about this book.  Although the politics of the age affect the events of this story, that alone did not bring the middle ages alive in this story.  Penman resorted to cheap tricks such as having over half the book take place in taverns in an attempt to create time and place.     In short, lack of detail, flat characters, bad dialogue, and no real mystery to solve made this book a huge disapointment 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 The author has used an inherently intriguing aspect of the field of linguistics -- the oxymoron -- and has written an awful book about it.  While the examples are all fine (though some do not technically belong), it it the author's own writing in betwixt the quotes that is unbearable.  I expect better prose from my 5th grader.  Not worth the time 
  Even without going outside the covers of The Liberty Incident, a conclusive case can be made for the proposition that this book was written in defense of the official Israeli position. If one goes outside the book to verify facts, the result is that the reader is unable to verify almost none of the facts.  Within the book, the author appears to make a conscious effort to obfuscate contrary facts by constantly digressing into wholly irrelevant subjects before returning to the subject under consideration.  For True Believers, this book is exactly what you are looking for. For everyone else, it is a complete waste of time 
 I had to read this book for my college history class, and I have to say I couldn't even get through the entire thing.  I love reading, and I'm enthralled with Ancient Egyptian history, so it was not as though I was going into it not even knowing the content.  I already knew much about the man known as Ramesses II, his wives and children, and much of what he had accomplished in Egypt during his reign, including Abu Simbel, Karnak and the Ramesseum (his mortuary temple), but this book just drug on and on.  I knew names, so that never confused me, but I think for people (especially in my class) who had to read this book and are not familiar with many of the previous reigning Egyptian pharaohs or their names, including pronunciation, it can be an extremely confusing read.  Tyldesley goes into too much detail of other pharaohs, using their names much too often, and as I said, for people who do not know Egypt, it can be extremely hard to follow.  Even I, being an Egypt lover, would get confused from time to time as to whom exactly she was talking about.  I would think that she was describing Ramesses at one point, but when I would read it over again, I would find that she was describing Seti or Amenhotep or Ramesses I.  I thought this book was going to be a piece of cake, considering it was less than 207 pages, I am a fast reader (I read Anne Rice books and get done with them in a couple of weeks, if they're long... 500+ pages), and also because, as I said before, I already have a decent amount of knowledge in Ancient Egyptian history so I thought I would enjoy it, but I found that it was a very slow read for me, and it became dull after the first chapter.  As I said, I had to get this book for my college history class, but even being an Egypt lover, I might have seen it in a bookstore and bought it just because it deals with the most fascinating civilization our world has ever known (in my opinion), but I even regret buying it for required reading.  I had also checked out Tyldesley's biography of Queen Hatshepsut from the library for a project in the same class, and even from the little bit that I read of that, I can tell that it is her style of writing, not just the Ramesses book, that I do not like.  Overall I found Ramesses to be a waste of money 
 If you're looking for he skill and talent of the likes of Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya, don't, I repeat-don't look here. While having some interesting elements, East Wind and Prayer are the only Asian albums I have purchased that have woefully dissapointed me. I love eclectic blends of Asian music combined with true talent. Neither East Wind nor Prayer appeal to me as anything close to enjoyable and aren't even in the same category as Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya. Save your $$ unless you enjoy Hip/Hop/Fusion/Asian/Ornamental blends not altogether well executed 
 This was ABSOLUTELY the worst movie I have ever seen!! Its so slow I started dozing off throughout the movie. You have no idea what is going on in the movie! Which some plots/directors/actors can pull off but this one at the end leaves you feeling like "What in the world??" You were hoping for some kind of clarity or grand ending where everything ties in but leaves you feeling like this was the biggest waste of my time and movie. There was no action what so ever, there was no climax, it wasn't scary at all and not thrilling....I really hate this movie... 
 This book is not really about creative people.  Instead, it's about a host of left-wing causes such as environmentalism, new age consciousness and feminism.  So, it's really a book about left-wing politics.  Also, to talk about this phenomenon as "new" is a bit of a misnomer.  For 100 years, intellectuals such as Djilas have talked about the "new class" and its excessive influence over public life.  Perhaps the current dominance of the political left over culture industries is inadequate for the authors, such that they would prefer a one-party dictatorship.  However, this would be hard for them to do.  If there is in fact a new development in recent years, it is the rise of new media such as the internet which have (in part) broken the one-party monopoly of the left-wing media.  Incidentally, at 370 pages the book is way too long and tedious.  Also, the research is typically poor--e.g. the unsupported chart on p. 211 that claims convergence of social and consciousness movements over the last 40 years--whereas the same converged left-wing bunch has been lobbying for this whole panoply of issues for decades.  Another example is the facile comparison between biological evolution and the life cycle of civilizations on p. 248. 
 I recently bought this item after reading the review for this book. I found this to be a mistake. I am an engineer by trade, and I found myself reading old school books so I could understand what this book was talking  about.  This book covers a wide variety of information and is difficult to  read.  This is not a book for the layman.... 
 These dishes look very nice on your table, but they have many problems. After about a year, my plates started cracking, directly above the ridge on the bottom.  Same with the bowls.   I have never been able to use them in the microwave because the item becomes very hot while the food is lukewarm. If they bump each other while running the dishwasher, they chip.  At least, when I put them in they are ok, but they are chipped when I take them out 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 ... I was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1... and of course i did buy it right a way.... then i was shocked when i started to read it.... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools Reference guide.... and actually a lot, lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well, i lost my money.. 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 My order arrived on time, the product was not as I expected. In my oppinion people shouldn't be allowed to use brand names like "Ray-Ban" if the product they sell is not that brand in particular. I guessed it by the price, but still, I thought, maybe was some crazy clearance, or who knows why. The package got here in excellent conditions. The seller offered a full refund, but I kept them to remind me of my mistake... So, the product's description is confusing and tricky... I am not happy with my purchase, but I hope I learned a lesson: "nobody sells $100 bills for $20" 
 There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...    
 After Tuesday, no more lettuce. Never again.  I can still see that lady's eyes.. 
 These cuts sound like re-recordings of 78's. I love Bix. There is no one better. To think that his recordings sounded so good with the limited technology of the time. I have Columbia 33 rpm Bix LP's from the 60's that have more clarity and less noise than these CD's. Even though I've allmost worn them out they still sound much much better than these offerings.I bought these CD's for 20 bucks at Tower records and I will never listen to them again.I give a Trillion-Billion stars to Bix's playing but this reissue's quality deserves none.But ...hey! Bix Lives!!!! 
 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 Other reviews were right, The first disc was great the second froze up halfway thru the Son of Frankenstein... the disc was loose when I rcv'd it. and is useless junk 
 Man, do I feel foolish. Usually, because I read so many books, I check them out of the library and then buy the ones I love so I can re-read them whenever I want. Well, I didn't do that this time -- mostly because I loved _Bread Alone_ so much that I couldn't wait to read it and I am so disappointed.  To me, this book reads like a jumbled mix of everything that was edited out of the first book. The pace is frustratingly slow and not much gets resolved. For example: the whole divorce issue, which was core in the first book, peters out as if the author is tired of discussing it.   As more of a minor but irritating point: not one person is happy in the entire book. Every employee has a personal crisis (none of which are resolved or moved forward) and the book ends very abruptly.  So, I'm ticked that I bought -- and read -- what amounts to the author's cast-off notes from _Bread Alone_. I kept hoping the story would get better but it never did. My mistake was not sticking to the "library strategy" 
 I read this book years ago when it was first published.  Mr. Sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of Iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence.  Some of the people Sick listened to were shown in the Iran-Contra hearings to be con artists who also took in Ollie North and Bill Casey.  These con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear.  One guy claimed to have been in Special Forces and was an eyewitness to one of VP-candidate Bush's flights to meet with Iranians.  It turns out that he was not in Special Forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the US Army.  In addition, he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time.  The phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work.  By the time I finished this book, I actually felt sorry for Sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers.  He clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true.  This book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe.  Subsequent investigations by a Democratically dominated Congress proved that there was no October surprise 
 This is a fascinating concept, and a marketable one as well, in light of America's current infatuation with the Edifice Complex.  Considering the author's scholarly credentials, SEX AND REAL ESTATE should have been a absorbing book.  "Should have" is the pivotal phrase here.  No question that Garber's body of knowledge is vast--she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis.  Maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader.  While I have no doubt but that this fact is true, the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble.  Anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed 
 a coffee table book come to life, ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting; you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid-20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it. 
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 Reading this book felt like being stuck next to a new parent on a long plane trip.  Either you're bored because you don't have kids, or you're bored because it is never your turn to talk about YOUR kid, or you are so kid-oriented and passive that you simply LOVE to hear all about the mundane ordinary pleasures that someone else gets from THEIR kid.  If you are in the latter category, or you are perhaps a single mom in recovery and born again in Christ, you will enjoy this book.  Otherwise, skip it and go spend some time with your real-life friends who have kids.  They need the company, and the baby stories are all pretty much the same.  Lamott's diary style offers 'reality' but little art 
 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUE HENRY?  THIS BOOK IS SUCH A LET DOWN; I ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD SOMEONE ELSE WRITE IT -- THE STORY IS FLAT AND THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES ARE CONFUSING.  SORRY TO SAY THAT I REALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS EVEN THOUGH I WANTED TO 
 
 With great anticipation and relish i awaited this accumulation of the works of probably one of the greatest playwrites of the 20th century. Having seen a short promotional film of the project, my eagerness was picqued.But, alas, flash, star-worship and diminished expectations rule once again in this travesty. Having actually not even been able to sit through the Endgame of this set, and having also seen the foolish, punk-flash version of Breath, and the unsympathetic and misunderstood, braindead interpretation of Not I, i am so appalled i nearly whipped this weighty and overly expensive set, frisbee-like,out the window. It never ceases to amaze how so much star power can do so much damage. Remember the Broadway travesty of Godot a few years ago with Robin Williams? So, Engame is a beautiful performance. all the Gaelic colloquial nuance of Beckett's language,perfectly understood and delivered in a heightened naturalism that is a joy to behold. The only problem is, one can NOT behold it because of the hack direction. Done in obsessively Television Direction School multi-camera work, anytime a charecter speaks or moves he is held in extreme talking-head close-up. next actor speaks, close up for him, then back to the other actor and so on and so on until the stomach of the viewer churns from this sea-sick demntia of camera close-ups,reaction shots, two shots and flashing long shots. So you don't have a play, or a film, you end up with a Television show of utter convention and utter unwatchability. i suggest people stay away from this possibly well-intentioned but decadent and unwatchable and expensive lump of Beckett Meets Hollywood by way of London. 
 We're huge Monk fans, but how could they tear-out the Spanish subtitles for Season 4?  This is an outrage and an insult. We're two hugely disappointed fans.  Tony, make it right, please 
 TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I READ ALL NORA ROBERTS BOOKS. SPELLBOUND IS NOT ONLY THE SHORTEST BOOK (I READ IT IN UNDER AN HOUR) OF HERS THAT I HAVE EVER READ, IT ALSO WASN'T TYPICAL OF HER USUAL WONDERFUL WRITING.  I ESPECIALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE THEME OF THE STORY 
 I purchased this book for my 8 yr. old son at our local school's book fair. Beautiful design, loads of information, the name "scholastic" on the cover. . . seemed perfect.  Imagine my dismay when I came home and got a chance to actually read some of the entries--notably George W. Bush.  Is David Rubel a member of Moveon.org? Of the DNC? Was he Howard Dean's speechwriter?   This author was COMPLETELY biased and it is definitely NOT an "encyclopedia"-- despite its claim to the contrary.  Encyclopedias are supposed to be unbiased. Children's books, especially, are not supposed to reek of bias.  David Rubel makes it clear that GWB is reviled--deservedly so--by everyone.  His entry on Bush clearly shows us his own personal views. He believes that only religious Christians support Bush, that Bush divided this country, that Bush only sees one side of every issue, and that he has angered the country by siding against stem cell research, pulling out of Kyoto, and the International Criminal Court. There's much more. As a matter of fact, there isn't ONE positive comment attributed to Bush, and there is a whole lot of negative "spin".  Scholastic ought to be ashamed of themselves for passing this off as an encyclopedia and might want to consider repackaging this book as "The Liberals Take on our US Presidents and Their Times".    Yes, there is clearly bias regarding some of the other entries, as well. But, the Bush entry is clearly the absolute worst.  I'm just saddened to know that, unfortunately, many children will find this book in their school's library and use it as reference material 
 Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique 
 this is really the most boring book i have ever read. i read the whole thing, waiting in vain for something good to happen, and while i was waiting, in vain, the book ended. that was it. the last page. no climax, no excitment. i could say that something good did happen, the book ended, but with a name like "the black album", you might expect something more ingriguing. maybe something having to do with, and this is a stretch....a black album. maybe i missed something, but the title and the fact that it did end were the 2 best things about this book. that, and i bought it either used, or on clearance. 
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 I thourougly enjoyed the movie, but these cuts remind you singularly forgettable the music sound track is (with the exception of one or two tunes such as "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish."   Save your money for the DVD, or better yet, look at the BBC video of the original TV production 
 I'm currently working through this book now as it's the required text for my General Chemistry course(s).  I have to say that I've had a harder time reading (and understanding) this text than usual.  I would not begin to recommend this book for general study, but let's face it, the only reason you're likely to buy this book is because it's required.  So here's how to use it:  Plan to read only one or two sections (4-5 pages per Section) in a study session.  Read it, work through the solved problems, skip to the problems covering that topic at the back of the chapter and see how well you do.  Buy the solutions manual - if you write out all your work (and you should, will particularly help if you forget how to solve something and your professor gives an open book/note exam), looking over the worked solutions will help.  Write down questions on specific problems and parts of the text/chapter you didn't understand.  Ask a tutor or the instructor.  The text is a hard read, but you -can- get through it. If I can do it, so can you. 
 My objection to this type of book is does nothing but create divides.  For example he lists one religion as a cult that currently is the fourth leading religion in the United States.  The pace it is setting it will be a world religion within a 100 years.  Not bad for a cult.  Just to set the record straight the dictionary defines a cult as a 1.System of religious worship and ritual.2.Devoted attachment to a person or principle3. a sect.  Under that definition every organized religion is a cult.  That would include Evangelical Christians as they espouse Bible and Being Saved.  
 My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED. 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 Fischer's attempts to analyze the influence of regional British folkways in colonial America holds much promise. Sadly, he uses, however, a simplistic and often contradictory interpretive methodology.     Much of his information on such vague topics as "freedom" ways is anctedotal. His maps of regional origins for colonists tend to contradict his findings. A case in point is his analysis of the so-called Cavalier society of Virginia. His map indicates a substantial Welsh component to the servant population. The Welsh, like the Irish and the Scots, are either ignored altogether or given cursory attention in the creation of a Tuckahoe [i.e. Virginian] identity. Admittedly, the English did dominate Virginia numerically, the contributions of the latter, however, particularly in the Northern Neck cannot be underestimated. The contribution of Northern English, the primary creators of Fischer's fourth folkway, to the Chesapeake population is also an issue that raises problems for Fischer's analysis as does the contribution of West Countrymen to New England.        In his analysis of backcountry folkways he relies heavily on McWhiney's "Cracker Culture," a particularly problematic book, and McDonald and McWhiney's Celtic theory of Southern culture and the so-called Highland zone theory of British history. Fischer ignores the contribution of low country white immigrants from Virginia and Pennsylvania Quakers to the the formation of Appalachian culture, not to mention the Germans. The Germans, in particular, may have contributed to the pastoral agricultural traditions of the Southern Appalachians. Finally, the role of African Americans in the formation of Southern society is never adequately explored.      Also, some of the information he employs in presenting his case about the so-called North Britons in the Backcountry is drawn from William Byrd's History of the Dividing Line. The individuals encountered by Byrd were infact drawn from Culture Number 2. Because Byrd's expedition through the Southside of Virginia pre-dated the later arrival of Scots-Irish and other PA settlers in places like Lunenberg or Mecklenberg county.      As a native of the Shenandoah Valley, and a product of cultures number 2 and 4, I personally found this premise fascinating. The English, because of their numbers and historical position in American culture, tend to be ignored as an ethnic group. So in this regard, Fischer's premise is sound, in the exploration of the ethno-cultural contributions of English folk cultures to American regionalism. Fischer's introductory descriptions of the environments encountered by the colonists is another example of promise not kept, when he downplays the role of creolization and adaptation to the new environment. But the broad generalizations Fischer employs detracts from the final product.      I was pleasantly surprised by Fischer's second book "Bound Away." For individuals interested in the process, in particular, by which Englishmen became Virginians I would recommend: 1. Alan Kulikoff's article "The Colonial Chesapeake: Seedbed of Antebellum Southern Culture?'"Journal of Southern History, 45 (1979), 513-40.  2. Alan Kulikoff's "Tobacco and Slaves" (1986). 3. Terry Jordon-Bychkov, "The Upland South: The Making of an American Folk Region and Landscape." I have problems with Jordan-Bychkov's Finnish contribution theory and the number of Upper Souther "mestizos" that the author posits. But the author maintains the traditional 3-part theory of John C. Campbell about Appalachian origins, namely: "Scots-Irish," Virginian/Carolinian [i.e. lowland whites] and Swiss-German.  4.Elizabeth A. Perkins and John Dabney Shane, "Border Life: Experience and Memory in the Revolutionary Ohio Valley" A fascinating account of one of the first frontiers where individuals from the different "regions," in particular cultures number 2 and 4 came together.  On the positive side I would recommend his analysis of child-rearing techniques. In particular his analysis of the so-called "will bending" as practised in Virginia. According to Fischer Virginians raised their sons to be both independent, assertive males, yet at the same time kept them economically and emotionally bound to their fathers. In this world daughters were taught to be submissive. Yet, as Fischer shows, Virginian daughters did not always conform to this social paradigm and with the sons this created an emotional paradox that had strong social implications. In this one example it is possible to see the way in which Fischer weaves together Anthropological and Historical methodology seamlessly.  In general the book is very readable and Fischer's arguments, whether you agree with them or not, are not hard to discern.   
 A totally contrived and badly written book.  I found it hard to believe that this was written be a professional writer.  Based on the television series, which is actually interesting and fun to watch, this book suffers by comparison.  No character development whatsoever, stilted dialogue, stock characters.  Don't bother with this knock-off of Kathy Reich's wonderful series 
 It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.  I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.  If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage 
 Read the biography by Mary Lovell, Straight On Till Morning.  Beryl Markham was a remarkable woman, albeit not really enculturated to her "Britishness," due to upbringing etc...but this running with the boys and learning to hunt was the root of her disaffection with life in England, and probably the root of her relationships.  She did what a lot of women ddn't even know one could.  And no one taught us in school that she was the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane...how judgemental is that?!  A fascinating life all the way.    
 If you are not into the family bed and other theories of Dr. Sears, this is not the book for you. This book didn't do anything for me. There are other approaches that seem more interesting, for example the ones described  by Dr. William A.H. Sammons. Dr. Sears and his wife views are certainly not  for everybody 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 I've read most books about Scott Peterson, and they were all pretty interesting and informative......This book was loaned to me, I did not spend a dime on it, nor would I.  Dalton makes many claims (occult, etc) with nothing to back it up. If they were investigators, couldn't they have tracked down  all of these "supposed" leads ???? A partial license plate number should be enough....many "supposed" witnesses don't have names...the ones that do never testified....what's that about??  If they were credible, don't you think a suppeana would have been issued ???? Especially by the defense????  I can see why he was fired from the defense team.... Anyway, that aside, the writing is terrible, nothing is consistent....suffice it to say----you've been warned. 
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 This textbook is extremely difficult to follow and doesn't flow very well.  I had a difficult time trying to understand the concepts the author was trying to make without having to read it several times 
 didnt like this album much. holiday was really good, but the rest of this album annoyed me 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 Carly's book was "ok". She cries alot, triumphs, and blames many around her. This one is definitely skippable 
 I have read all the books in this series (except for Pride, which oddly has not been released yet). It it difficult to imagine that such a small book on such an interesting subject could be so completely tedious. It rarely deals with the actual subject of greed, but is more a reference to the 7 Deadly Sins as a whole. The author has chosen to use really, really big words, poor punctuation, and a myriad of endnotes to address this subject. Between the poor writing, the sloppiness of the intellectual examination on this topic and those pesky endnotes which require the endurance of a marathon runner to flip back and forth to, this book is like getting a hamburger without the meat, served by a sneering waiter 
 This comic is so stupid. When you boil it down, it's NOTHING but " White people do this, and black people do THIS" jokes with "Bush is stupid!" thrown into the mix. This is like an officially licensed webcomic. Not worth the money, or time to read it. And despite it's OCCAISIONAL message against racism, the jokes are usually racist. People who will enjoy this book are those who are too lazy to read a real boo 
 The previous review  stated "Nixon refused to acknowledge African-Americans were over-represented in Vietnam. Today, this fact is a given." For many years I thought so too, until I saw the official statistics:  88.4% of the men who actually served in Vietnam were Caucasian: 10.6% (275,000) were African-American; 1% belonged to other races   86.3% of the men who died in Vietnam were Caucasian (includes Hispanics); 12.5% (7,241) were African-American; 1.2% belonged to other races   170,000 Hispanics served in Vietnam: 3,070 (5.2% of total) died there   70% of enlisted men killed were of Northwest European descent   86.8% of the men who were killed as a result of hostile action were Caucasian; 12.1% (5,711) were African-American; 1.1% belonged to other races   14.6% (1,530) of non-combat deaths were among African-Americans   34% of African-Americans who enlisted volunteered for the combat arms   Overall, African-Americans suffered 12.5% of the deaths in Vietnam at a time when the percentage of African-Americans of military age was 13.5% of the total population  Sources: Department of Defense casualty records Labor Department Department of Veterans' Affairs National Personnel Records 
 This should have been titled, "1001 Ways Other People Took Initiative, But Aren't Applicable To What You Do". Bob Nelson's latest in the series is little more than a non-stop string of industry stories and reader comments solicited from the web. This book does not aid in taking initiative because the "examples" are provided without comment or insight into how to apply this more generally; it's far too specific to be of use to anyone else.  What remains, including comments from professionals and researchers, has some value but is insignificant for the size of the book. The insights Nelson provides are distinctly unoriginal and will be well known to anyone who's ever read another book on empowerment or efficiency 
 I bought my light timer from Target. when I got it I thought "Hey, this oughtta be a good one..." seeing as it's made by Timex, I figured it would be a good buy.  I found out it was a piece of [...] I would set the time just as it said on the back instructions, I had everything set correctly. When the day ran to 5PM, I expected it to turn on, but it didn't. I pulled out my couch and looked behind it to find that the dial AM/PM buttons on the timer had went all the way around with the ticker and pulled themselves next to eachother and the time had been reset. No matter how many times I fixed it, over and over again it would repeat the same process. I was VERY annoied. so... on my 23rd attempt at setting it correctly, I CAREFULLY read the instructions on the back of the timer, set it, making sure it was correct, and pluged it in once more. five o'clock rolls around and nothing happens. When it turned to 5:30 the light timer turned on.  I had the timer set to 5PM turn on time and 2AM turn off time.  the timer turned off at 11PM. That was the one and ONLY time it ALMOST did something correctly.  Today, frustrated with the timer, I tried setting it again. Well, it's broke now. I twisted it the wrong way on purpose, putting the horrible item out of it's misery.  I wouldn't reccomend this timer to anyone. 
 In the 1960's facing the cruel conditions of institutionalization and coercive psychiatry, writers such as R.D. Laing, Ken Kesey and Thomas Szasz commented on real oppression but took a swerve in the opposite direction. As a person with mental illness, I cannot agree with what Thomas Szasz is saying. Yes medication has horrific side effects. Yes coercion is wrong.  Yes some people are diagnosed with a mental illness who have psychological problems (but in another book he is opposed to talk therapy as well, what isn't this guy opposed to?), yes some people are given medication who could do without it, yes there are new diagnoses that are not credible (road rage) but mental illness does exist. Denying mental illness and then saying the insanity defense should be eliminated because of course people did it according to their own volition (according to Szasz's reasoning) is a classic extreme libertarian viewpoint, stating firmly what is wrong but failing to come up with humanitarian alternatives. Read any book by Judi Chamberlin (a real life consumer/survivor) or track down the movie Hurry Tommorow (about the horrific conditions in an institution from the point of view of the "patients") instead of this dated, academic, dully written excercise in philosophy that detracts from the people it is supposedly championing 
 I bought this movie because it got such great reviews.  What were they thinking?!  This movie is terrible.  I was expecting a nice heart-warming "chick-flick."  I was very disappointed.  This movie is extremely BORING.  It moves so slowly!  The whole thing just feels like it's dragging.  Boring, boring.  I kept hoping it would get better.  It never did.  Even the ending was lousy.  You can tell this was a LOW-BUDGET film.  Apparently they couldn't afford to film a wedding scene, or even Bella's funeral!  How pathetic.  Don't bother watching or buying this.  It's a waste of time 
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 The Internet doesn't allow one to write faster; it simply sends the message faster. It is another stage in the development of commerce, not a new medium of communication. Opportunists are so happy to have something new to perch on, but beware: you've got to entertain to get away with making a living making something out of nothing. This doesn't 
 sounds like a wonderfull book but here almost 1 year later i still havent gotten the book,  a response from amazon, or a response from the shipper 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 If Zero Stars had been an option, that would have been my rating. I am currently on my THIRD, yes THIRD return of this tank (luckily I got it from a Petstore, otherwise I would not be able to afford the shipping for all of the returns).  Thank God I filled out my warranty card!  On all 3 tanks, the filter STOPPED WORKING, despite my WEEKLY cleanings of the tank, filter and magnetic spinner (as well as changing the filter cartridge as suggested, if not sooner).  I will NEVER buy a Marineland Tank again 
 This is a tiring story about a woman whos husband left her for a younger better looking woman.  She has been collecting alimony for thirty years now and is still complaining about it like she was the only woman in the World to lose a husband.  The half of the book that doesn't carp on her failed marriage(s) talks about her draggging a group of children around the World in an attempt to get World leaders to meet with her.  The sad thing is that this synopsis makes the book seem more interesting than it is.    What might have been interesting would be some contrition, insights, or growth.  Instead this is a stale and bitter tale- the millionth story about a poor little rich girl which is hard to identify with or feel sorry for 
 When we last left the Next Generation crew, Picard saved Data in an Errol Flynn kind of way against the Queen Borg.   Star Trek year: 2375.   We sure are missing the original Star Trek Enterprise crew of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc by now.   Worf who is now assisting Deep Space Nine boards the Enterprise for a visit.  Picard (Patrick Stewart) certainly has his hands full tonight with an elegant dinner for Regent Cuzar.  LaForge (Levar Burton) has an urgent message for Picard at the same time and Picard is trying to memorize the foreign language for greeting Regent Cuzar so as not to insult the Regent.   Admiral Doughtery (Anthony Zerbe) would like to tell Picard that Data (Brent Spiner) has been a naughty robot and will not obey Starfleet protocol. He is holding the Brair patch hostage, which is a population of 600 people.   Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) is the Son'a ship captain.  he enjoys partaking in a quick facial surgery procedure.  (Don't we all wish we could).  Ru'afo informs Picard, Data has turned dangerously violent and has done damage to the ship.  Data must be destroyed.  Picard has 12 hours to save data or Picard will terminate the android himself.   Also in the cast: Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Donna Murphy, Gregg Henry, Michael Horton, McKenzie Westmore (NBC serial, Passions) is credited as a Ba'ku villager.    Does the Brair Patch have Cabbage Patch dolls too?  Sorry I coudn't resist.  Easter Egg: Disc 2 Special Features, click Star Trek Universe, click down to main menu, but do not press.  Use "right" button instead.  Middle octagon will turn blue.  Press "enter". Tom Morello will talk on location about playing "Sona".   Disc 2 also includes 6 deleted scenes and the Alternate Ending.   One deleted scene includes Max Grodench playing a Trill ensign.  He was "Rom" in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine tv series (1993-1999).    The next voyage is STAR TREK: NEMESIS (2002)  Update: J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof (ABC Network's LOST) will produce and direct STAR TREK XI.  Rumor is it will be a prequel about young James T. Kirk in the Starfleet Academy and about Spock.  It will be released Xmas 2008. 
 Have you ever read a great book and then had been very disappointed with the sequel? That's exactly what will happen if you read Gary Paulsen's series of books starting out with Hatchet. All of his books are great until you read Brian's Return. Brian, the kid who was lost in the Northern Canadian Woods for the whole fall and winter,  is having trouble in high school. His life was chanced ever since his small plane crash into the woods. Now, he's confused because he doesn't understand why some people live the way they do. For example, his old friends always wanting to ride there bikes or play video games at the mall. He gets in a fight with another teenager in his school. The police make him get a little help from an old blind man that helps teenagers with there problems. Brian tells him why he got in a fight, and why he's so different. He thinks Brian should take a visit back to the woods. Of course, he does, but once he goes there isn't really an ending. I didn't like this book because when Brian goes back to the woods, there's no conflict or problem like there is in almost every story. Also, the story focuses on very stupid things like Brian loving tea and Shakespeare' s plays. This book will be disappointing if you read Gary Paulsen's other books, but boring and confusing if you don't read the other books. I wouldn't recommend reading this book for fun 
 I bought this movie because I love to see an old tale tespun and retold. If it is done well there is nothing better to read or watch. This movie is not a retelling of "Beauty and the Beast" as its title and premise would indicate. I own several versions of "Beauty and the Beast" on DVD and in print. And after reading the reviews here I was really looking forward to adding this movie to my collection and I was excited to have the chance to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be great! BUT IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I was prepared for the horses and I was prepared for the nudity and the eroticism. I was not prepared for the filmmaker's mangling of "Beauty and the Beast".  That is what the blurb on the box suggests. But instead of getting the Beauty and the Beast message of the redeeming power of love, you get a half-hearted sermon against bestiality. I didn't know that was such a problem in this world. I mean I have never had the urge and I don't know of anyone who has. There have been no reports on the news about people sexually assaulting livestock that I have heard. I am sure I would have heard something if such was the case. There is no excuse for what Borowczyk has done here. The movie starts out slow, I can forgive that, I have an attention span (too many people don't.) The story starts to pick up momentum and promise when the beast appears. Then the story heads for the cliff and unhesitatingly dives off! I saw the kernel of a good movie here. WHAT HAPPENED? Do yourself a favor. Skip this one 
 This is not the worst book I've ever read, but it is very close!  It had potential to be a good read, but lacked in many key areas.  The characters were fairly interesting and decently developed individually, but the  outcome of all their interaction was not develped nearly enough.  The  entanglment of the characters had good plot potential, but ended up being  VERY anticlimactic.  I felt like the book was unfinished and probably  needed at least another hundred pages or so to round out the characters and  their situations.  It even felt as if it was published exactly as the first  draft was written, without any content editing, rewriting or further plot  development.  Every Day is Mother's Day is a book that had promise, but  fell quite short of it's potential 
 This watch stinks.  Crappy manual, the band is so big it could fit around my leg, and when I received it, IT DIDN'T WORK.  Now I have to pay extra to fix the band AND to get it working.  So much for what I thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch. I would've given it no stars if I could. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID - AVOID THIS WATCH 
 For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger 
 The record shows Archie Manning, the  Elder of his unfortunate football family was the worst QB in Pro Football  history! His 28-72-1 record and losing (not winning) % is the worst in NFL hi- story. Not that this family is disfunction- al or anything. Peyton Manning is one of the better push-button NFL QBs today, if only he calls his plays once in a while. But he still is horrid in the playoffs. True, no QB got to 33,000+ yds., faster in Pro Football history (that includes the better CFL). Good 'ole Archie Mann- ing was one of the most loved by the  Football Establishment who made all  sorts of excuses why the Saints couldn't  win and Manning is the main reason! Back- up Bobby Scott, who later fizzles in Pro season number 12 in the USFL, was better, as evidenced by his 10-9-1 record. In  fact when he left (then Coach) O.A. 'Bum' Phillips Saints (Dec. 1982) he was the winningest QB in Saints history (%wise)! Don't give me any of that bull about the Saints not having the talent to win! They had superb RBs like Chuck Muncie, Tony Gal- braith, DBs like Tommy Myers, Terry Schmidt, Johnny Fuller, OLm Emanual Z-Man Zanders (not the lead singer for Cheap Trick!). Manning was so horrid one of the first thing Phillips did upon coming aboard with (then) John Mecom's Saints was to get rid of Archie and Viola! The Saints started winning! Ditto for Eli of the New York Football Giants, the worst Pro starting QB since, well...Archie! And how about the piece of work Olivia his mom? She tells him to not play in San Diego! Oh, great food, good weather, but don't go there! Good instead to a nuclear swamp waste like the New Jersey Meadowlands where poor Bobby Scott had to go to! Archie and Eli are made for each other. And will Peyton ever win an AFC Championship let alone a Super Bowl? As they say in 'Joisee' - Fahgedaboutdit!!!!!! 
 If you would like this item to actually arrive then get it somewhere else. I've been waiting since late January 
 I thought the plot was ok and I personally like Mina but I had trouble getting through the book because it is full of typos. Very dissapointing quality, editing wise 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 Sir Leycester Coltman was Head of the Foreign Office's Latin America Department, then Ambassador to Cuba (1991-94), then to Colombia (1994-98). But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.   This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.   Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.  He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.  Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.   He warned, "Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head."  
 Maybe I'm just not old enough to appreciate this book fully, but I found it to be a boring read. I forced myself to finish it, thinking I would get something out of it, but again, I mostly found it to be dull. The other thing is ---although I don't think this was the intent of the author --- I felt a little bad about my appearance and for the next two days after reading this book, I found myself dwelling on how I would age. If you are on the fence about your looks, do yourself a favor and don't read this book. But if you're thinking about getting plastic surgery perhaps you would get something out of it. If I could I would give it 2.5 stars because I'm right in the middle, I was creeped out and bored but others might learn something about the state of the art and also how society views cosmetic surgery in 2006 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 Ballard makes several keen insights in this book (many of them startlingly prescient).  However, digging those nuggets of clarity out of the surrounding mess is difficult and often unrewarding work.  The repetetive and disjointed nature of the narrative quickly leads to confusion--confusion about the characters, their motives, and the surrounding events.  And perhaps that was intentional, but it doesn't make for a satisfying read.  "The Assasination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race" was one of the few bright spots in the narrative, but not quite bright enough for me to consider this book as anything more than a failed experiment 
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 I too bought these after not finding spindles of the Verbatim DL. A few work, but only a very few. I have an NEC recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these. The machine is a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, so this is not a resource issue. Sigh 
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 I bought this book for my sewing class; however, I don't like it because it doesn't have as much substance as the "Fitting & Pattern Alterations" book.  In addition, it is over-priced.  I like chapters 2 and 3 best out of the whole book.  There is a typo on page 3, bullet #4.  Most of the clothing sketches are dated; I've hardly seen anyone who dresses in those styles that were illustrated in the book. I personally don't believe that anyone can wear any style because each person has a different figure shape, height and weight.  As for the style tip, I'd rather pick up a good how to dress fashion book 
 I expected to really enjoy this book, but was disappointed.  Some of the stories/essays were very good, but some of them were poorly written and/or could have done with some serious editing. It might have been better if some of them had been omitted: the book would probably have been half as long, but the overall quality would have been significantly improved.  I was also disappointed by the way the book was laid out.  It seemed jumbled and poorly conceived.  Photos, illustrations and cartoons/comics were seemingly thrown in randomly, with little context or relation to the surrounding content. The graphic content of the book was good, but the layout just did not display it to full advantage.  The idea behind this book was a good one, but the execution could have been a little bit better 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 Awesome movies, but way too expensive for the product itself.     First, I bought it at a reduced priced, since it was left sitting on a shelve collecting dust for a few years in the store.  They dropped the price from a initial $200 Can (around $150 U.S.), to $149 Can (around $110 U.S.), and that was the cheapest price I could find it in my city and by far.  A few of the stores told me that their cost was around $149 Can, so it was able to buy it at around cost.  Considering that, it was a bargain, so I got lucky to start with.    Now the movies, they are awesome, and after watching them all in two days, I felt sad, sad at Hollywood and the current level of movie making, after tasting a piece of history, with movies that are deep, funny, either deals with issues (Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress) or don't (Yojimbo and Sanjuro), they are all movie gems.  But we can also be realistic here, seven Samurai in my opinion is the real champion in this set, it has everything, it's epic, yet personal, it's deep, yet sometime funny, but always powerful and superb.    Now to the quality of the disk, that where it's hard to tell, these are old movies.   But something struck me as odd, Seven Samurai (7S), was done around 10 yrs before Yojimbo and Sanjuro but looks and sound better, obviously, they cleaned it out a little before putting it to DVD, but then, if Yojimbo and Sanjuro where made 10 yrs later, someone should expect at least a equal quality, if not better then the 7S, but it's not the case, especially Yojimbo is painful to watch, the sound track has a loud background hiss for at least half of the movie, scratches as big as a straw that last a full min multiple times, the contrast and brightness is out of wack in half the scenes, it's a painful experience, you tell yourself how great the movie is, but is it ever ugly to watch.    So far I would give it 4 stars, why then I give it 2?    It's down to price vs quality and extras. No extras what so ever beside the theater trailer of each movie, and a commentary track for 7S, then nothing.  So Criterion in my mind had two choice, drop the price to 1/3 to 1/2 of what it is now, or pick a better original copy to bring on DVD, clean it, and add extras, selling it to the same price it is now, but they did neither.  They used for Yojimbo, a terribly copy, add nothing, and charge full Criterion price, BAD !!! So in the end, one fell like being robbed by Ronins.  In my case, I wanted to see those movies, and own 7S and this box set was the only way to go about doing this, and in the end, I praise the movie, the acting, the story, the camera work, everything, except Criterion DVD who brought those movies it North America, they dropped the ball on this one.    So 0 stars for Criterion and there DVD product (in this case) and 4 stars for the movie themselves so my end review is 2 stars 
 Certainly the first page had me tempted to throw the book into the nearest recycle bin! Only trash begins with 'The girl sat mesmerized by fear in the big chair. Please does that interest you in the character? Oh and fear lit her face, excuse me, fear never lights up a face, it drains it of color, makes it ridged, stretches the skin taut against fragile bones. Has this writer ever seen true fear on someone's face? The antagonist calls her a silly child, then launches into a moronic monologue. How corny and melodramatic. All these offenses to the storyteller's art in less than a page! Did Norton truly edit,look or even glance at that first limp opener? I've read better lines in a first grade primer! If I could do so with out causing copyright infringement problems, I would take every page and rewrite the entire thing. Unbelievable what tripe is published now. Please tell me, in all seriousness, it was just a matter of wanting the royalties from the use of the famous name on the cover. For using a challenging fantasy world created by that well known writer. I could forgive that. I can not if anyone truly thought there was even a hint that this other individual could write anything more engaging than a toilet roll wrapper. An award winner? It must have been a very low turn out of talent that week. I will not pick up another book by this 'other' writer again. I've read the works of great writers and fair, but this was inexcusable 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Poems in this book make no sense and are hard to read . the rest of it is ok 
 While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent.  PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available.  Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to  Sokal 1996).  Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement.  
 I cannot justify simply giving this album such a poor review without a history lesson, at least as I see it from my perspective, especially given that I have traditionally enjoyed VNV Nation's music among my favorites.  VNV Nation used to have this elusive, captivating quality that set their music apart from cut-and-copy EBM.  I really don't know how to describe it; I think I once called it "conceptual continuity" when talking with a friend.  VNV's older albums, like "Advance and Follow" and "Praise the Fallen," were alive with creativity, originality and potency, easily making them the forerunners in quality EBM in the mid-to-late 1990s.  I daresay that VNV's first three albums were better than Front 242's "Up Evil" and "Off," making them basically the new heirs to 242's old position, which was only solidified when 242's last album was a mishmash of experimentation and hard trance (although it was undeniably brilliant, it was a definite genre shift).  Fast forward to "Futureperfect."  This was an album of higher highs and lower lows than any of VNV Nation's previous releases -- the bright spots were practically blinding, especially on tracks like "Electronaut."  Simultaneously, there were songs that were just outright bad -- "Liebestod" and "Holding On" were respectively out of place and of poor quality in general.  Some of the other songs, like "Epicentre," were toss-ups.  The tour supporting the release of their Live DVD "Pastperfect" was astounding.  After seeing them live and watching the DVD afterwards, I had high hopes for the next release, "Matter + Form."  Those hopes were dashed by the album's complete lack of focus, increasing amounts of formulaic music ("Entropy" could be on the soundtrack of any generic sci-fi shooter and not feel out of place in the least), and in general a sharp drop-off in quality.  I was so excited that beyond purchasing the album I even paid separately for the "Chrome" digital download before the release, and when I got the album itself I was immensely disappointed -- apart from maybe 3 or 4 good songs, the rest of the album was either boring or just unpleasant; I'd expect that kind of quality from some corporate rock band, not from any respectable electronic act.  However, I have known bands to occasionally try an experimentation with a new album only to return to form later on, so I decided not to abandon my hopes for the band and give them another shot.  I own all of VNV Nation's albums, several t-shirts, the Pastperfect DVD, and have seen them in concert, yet they will not receive another dollar of my money, and "Judgement" is the reason for this.  Here is my breakdown of the album:  1. "Prelude" - Synthesized orchestrals.  Sounds cheesy.  Unfortunately, while most VNV Nation albums feature an introduction that I skip, this one is about four times as long as the rest of them, and about sixteen times as long as it should be. 2. "The Farthest Star" - It has a good beat.  The lyrics aren't particularly catchy, it's not really fast or really slow -- I guess I could tolerate it as background music, but not much else. 3. "Testament" - I'll admit, this song is kinda catchy...but not in the way that I would like.  It's catchy like Apoptygma Berzerk used to be catchy -- you want it to get out of your head; you're not happy that it's there.  Ronan can't sing very well, and that's part of the appeal of the older albums; it's more speaking and less singing. 4. "Descent" - This probably has some of my favorite music on the album.  The lyrics, again, aren't memorable in the least, but the background music feels like something that I wish they would explore in a more prolonged fashion.  At least Ronan is speaking in this song. 5. "Momentum" - This is my other favorite music on the album; it's fast, mostly instrumental, and then Ronan begins yammering stupid phrases that vaguely evoke images of movement.  For some reason, that ruins it for me. 6. "Nemesis" - Billed as the hardest-hitting song on the album, it features aggressive but boring lyrics over an aggressive but uptempo (and annoying) melody.  Not enough bass to really be angry.  Suffers from the "Entropy" problem -- sounds like it belongs in a video game soundtrack. 7. "Secluded Spaces" - Quiet ballad.  'Nuff said.  Its only saving grace is that its not quite as strained as "Colours of Rain" from "Matter +  Form." 8. "Illusion" - Ballad again?!  Ronan, you charlatan!  Honestly, this is horrible.  It's a forced, cheesy attempt at a pop song. 9. "Carry You" - By this point, I had realized that VNV Nation was starting to get too involved with the poppish sounds.  I'd put the song here about on the level of Phil Collins or "Adult Contemporary" artists in terms of quality, if any of that ilk decided to start making electronic music. 10. "As It Fades" - An unremarkable outro full of synth voices.  Boring.  Given that, I feel that this album lacked everything that I used to like about VNV Nation -- it's not coherent, it's not solemn, it's not even that interesting.  Even bad bands can be so bad that they stand out; "Judgement" is doomed for the bargain bin and anonymity in a sea of bland, soulless "futurepop."  If you're an EBM fan who wants to listen to something much, much better, pick up Covenant's "Skyshaper" -- it's a much better listen, much more entertaining, much more creative, and overall a much better release in the vein of traditional EBM 
 While I am glad that Ms. Olsen found the courage to speak out about the effects of severe child abuse, I found this book to be one woman's meandering tyraid against practically everyone and everything in her life, past and present.  It was difficult to follow and depressing...and I also have DID.  I did not find it the least bit inspiring or encouraging for fellow multiples.  Rather, I found it to be written in an almost self-pitying and egocentric manner. This very well could have been a message of personal testimony coupled with inspiration and encouragement.  However, the book is filled with one-sided rants that are very difficult to follow. If you are a multiple, do not look to this book for any hope or encouragement.  
 I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand "BLUR" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 Construction quality of the mount seems good, but it is not universal out of the box.  Despite being listed as compatible with my Sharp Aquos LC-37GD4U on the manufacturer's website, it does not ship with compatible screws to attach to the television.  The directions list incorrect screws that are too fat, while the ones that actually do fit into the TV are too short or too long.  I'd recommend trying something else rather than relying on this product's questionable compatibility info and directions 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I think this book is of, literally, only academic interest.  The author's premise:  capitalism will only be "safe" when protected by (Ta Da!!) -- more government regulation!  Only an academic (or a socialist) could come to this conclusion!  The fundamental premise of this book is that the danger to Capitalism is exclusively from "crony" Capitalists.  This is surely tantamount to blaming the victim for the crime.  The authors take tremendous pains to footnote a variety of statements, and then make a totally unsubstantiated claim of price-fixing against modern business by dredging up an ancient Adam Smith quote!  They point to the correlation between market regulations and higher stock valuations, mistaking it for causation.  Not one single time do they even mention the danger posed to capitalism by the MSM, socialist NGO's, lawyers, or the tangle of local, state, and federal regulations.  Only twice do they mention, in passing, the arguments of libertarians.  We are not a politically powerful party, but our opinions on capitalism surely must deserve, at the least, a vigorous rebuttal.  And finally, the recommendations are ad-hoc -- there is no flow of evidence or argument to support them.  Indeed, the conclusions are, in typical academic fashion, sadly naive.  An example is their belief that property taxes are somehow less onerous than income taxes.  This is a position in opposition to the authors' defense of property rights.  Indeed, Texas just passed a law to begin taxing business income because the previous system, based solely on business property, imposed no tax burden on doctors, lawyers, accountants, actors, authors, college professors engaged in sideline businesses, etc.  Little wonder that "old line" businesses were moving overseas or dying out -- they were supporting the parasites, doubly.  The reader is engaged only on the occasions (and by accident?) when the authors reveal insights derived from their experiences with other cultures, or when they review certain lesser-known historical facts.  In conclusion, I was disappointed in this "apology" for capitalism.  To give the authors credit, I would say that it must be very difficult to write a book espousing capitalism and still expect to get or keep tenure at a private, U. S. university, even one with Hayek and Friedman in the pedigree. 
 Not Amazon's fault, but Everlast's.  Even the box promises 2 10-pound weights, but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights.  This is not a bargain, but fairly expensive.  Quality is just ok.  Not flimsy or dangerous, but not what I wanted, either 
 I will always remember this book as one that put me to sleep quickly.  All they ever do is sit around in "the dry".  The mother goes through amazing mood swings too.  One minute she is tired, the next angry, and the next sad.  And what grandmother and mother in their right mind let a 14 year old girl drive a car around the desert?!  The book has no ending either and is extremely anti-climactic.  I hated this book and everyone that i know also despised it.  I strongly recommend that no one who wants to read something half way engaging read this book!!!!!!!!!!! 
 LOL!  Christ!  What in God's name was Patterson thinking?  I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors.  I fell in love with John Sandford's "Prey" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.   Boy!  What a disappointment and what a bad first impression!  The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week.  Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men.  Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense.  She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music.  She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly.  While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him.  The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will.  I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable.  It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her.  AT ALL.  Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?  
 Seems like WB method is nothing new - testimony - dispute - advocacy.  Sounds like Hegel's - thesis -antithesis - synthesis ? WB like Purdue and others see the collapse of history as a way of understanding ancient  Israel,but if all we have left are words,who would want to trust a god who  talks but doesn't do anything  
   If you want a book about how to gaze at your crotch with a mirror, or advice to smell and taste your body secretions, (I KID YOU NOT!!!) this book is for you.  If you want a serious book about Witchcraft, go somewhere else.  This book is going in the trash bin 
 This is an important document for those who will someday write a serious non-polemical history of the McIntyre / IHM conflict. As such it deserves more than one star.  Antia Caspary (Mother Humiliata) lead the IHM nuns during their confrontation with Los Angeles Cardinal McIntire over nuns wearing religious garb, living in community, and their terms of service in the diocesan schools of Los Angeles. This conflict lead to the sisters presenting demands unacceptable to the bishop and his request that they leave the schools of his diocese.  Caspary's book gives her version of the conflict -- as is the role of a memoir.  The world it reveals gives one pause, it is a Manichean dystopia of pure evil and pure good.  McIntyre and the "male hierarchy" are corrupt wicked men with no redeeming qualities. The sisters who sided with Caspary are without any stain, the only real Christians, flawed only by perhaps occasional fearfulness in following her lead.  Sadly, there are glaring omissions that leave the reader misinformed or uninformed: there is nothing about the role of the famous Maslow-Rogers sensitivity sessions that played such a large role in polarizing the congregation and fostering the self-assertive and uncompromising tone that characterized (as is clear in the book) the nuns confrontations with the bishop. Missing too are the 50 nuns that reestablished the IHMs in spite of the powerful influence of group think. Missing again is anything kind of context, such as what actually happened to other sisters' congregations that adopted the IHM model (polarization and then extinction mostly).  To read this memoir is to step back into the late 1960s, when every Catholic nun and priest was absolutely certain that they know exactly what Vatican II meant (because they had read Xavier Rynne, if not the council documents) and so was empowered to tell everyone else what to do.  Her apologia reveals remarkable similarity of attitude between poor old-fashioned Irish pastor McIntyre and the "up-to-date sister" Anita.  Both were intolerant of those who disagreed and dismissive of other's views. Both were self-righteous (Anita, as is obvious from this book, and McIntyre, if we can trust her characture of him) and incapable of self-criticism. And it seems one of them still is: even though McIntyre's successor has apologized to the Caspary's Immaculate Heart Commuity (see p. 200) for his mishandling of the confrontation, Anita has no apologies for anyone.  She has always been right and always will be.  "It is better to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven" --Milto 
 About ninety percent of LaVey's stories were massive lies. And this book fairs no better.Read a good book on Wicca instead. The COS still reels in the Christian lemmings 
 The camera worked fine; however, after six months, it stopped working.  I took it to a Pentax authorized repairer and Pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism.  My use was in no way abusive.  I had a previous Canon Powershot S200 that lasted forever with the same usage, until I gave it away.  I guess I should have stayed with Canon.  I bought the Pentax for its size and lightweight, but what good is that if it doesn't last!  Don't get the Pentax and expect long term use out of it 
 I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.     I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.  I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.      I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase.  
 I am a junior in high school and for the past three days our history class has watched this film. I respected its point and purpose, but I must say it was one of the most uneventful and unexciting films I have ever seen. It never grabs your attention and starts to get repetitive. Unless you plan on a nap, I don't recommend this film 
 The idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful. I have it, have pictures on it, but never show it to anyone. Trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous. Easier to show a few pictures in my wallet 
 I really wanted to like this book, and I did for about the first half. Towards the end the story just became too unbelievable. It seemed as though the characters were fully modern individuals who just happened to be wearing period clothing. The so called spies were as inconspicuous as an elephant in a china shop. The very end up of the book was really the last straw for me, it was incredibly cheesy and predictable, and worst of all entirely implausible.   The dual storyline of the modern Eloise had potential, but never went anywhere and was therefore unnecessary and didn't flow with the "historical" (I use the term loosely in regards to this book) storyline. 
 The Junie B. Jones series represents thoughtful storytelling replete with the sorts of syntactic and semantic errors that all thoughtful parents try to stamp out of their children's discourse conventions. For example, my multilingual daughter, a second grader in an international school in Japan, incessantly mixes Korean, Japanese and English grammars and meanings, not to mention reproducing the very colloquial forms of casual spoken English I'm always encouraging her to readjust in agreement with more standardized forms.  The typical difficulties that young native speakers of English have in moving, say, from the comparative to the superlative or in adjusting tense forms in regular and irregular verbs are codified throughout this series. Those who might object to this critique would also have to defend why errors such as those referenced here occur not only in the dialogues among the characters, but also in the expository portions of the stories. The author makes no effort to encourage her young readers to see the differences between colloquial forms and the more widely accepted standardized forms.  Thanks to Ms. Park's efforts, young children honing their language skills now have an opportunity to model the varieties that society generally deplores. Though her stories are delightfully cute, her methods do not further the kinds of knowledge that the larger society will come to expect from informed citizens. If her editor hasn't yet been dismissed, I would encourage Ms. Park to reflect a bit more on her approach to educational texts. 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
   I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns,  historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price.  Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity.  This book was fluffy & dull 
 While I was reading this book I brought it into work one day and a co-worker (an avid Mets fan) asked me what the book was about.  I explained it breaks down baseball strategies and ideologies.  He said it sounded kind of tedious.  I replied it was at times, but at the time I was still working my way through it.  In fact, this book is very tedious.  Felber lost me when he said that Grady Little faced a very difficult decision in the 2003 ALCS when he went to the mound to talk with Pedro Martinez.  He discusses how many times a tiring ace pitcher can be a better choice than a fresh reliever and gives some examples.  He completely ignored the fact that Martinez's OPS against jumps over 300 points after 100 pitches.    "The Book on The Book", as previously mentioned in Brian A. Powell's review, is an extremely dry read.  I also noticed two errors in the book: Misspelling Sidney Ponson's first name "Sydney" and referring to the umpire monitoring device Questec as "Questrec."  All in all, not worth a read 
 I've never written a review, but I just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot, and you're killing Hip-Hop. Stop killing my music 
 This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK 
 I've used gas wine preservers for many years with good results. In my opinion, it's the best way to preserve an opened bottle of wine.Private Reserve is a good product except that the last can I bought had only 22 two second bursts in it. They advertise 120 uses and 600 seperate sprays. I don't know if someone tampered with only this bottle or whether it's the norm but beware that you may run out of the gas sooner than later 
 I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar.  A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors.  I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels.  From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description 
 While Dr. Grandin's poignant unraveling of the mysteries of autism deserves the accolades it has received, her perspectives on animals are deeply tainted by her research into "humane" slaughter techniques, which ultimately have an economic rather than a purely scientific rationale. After all, the meat industry cares not one iota about whether animals are treated humanely or not, only whether they can be "disassembled" as quickly and efficiently as possible. Thus, while Grandin's work may indeed make the treatment of farm animals more humane when they reach their brutal demise, it nevertheless facilitates the expansion of an industry that is anything but humane, bringing ever greater numbers of animals under the sway of its remorseless logic of bloodthirsty death. History does not judge the petty functionaries of the Final Solution, the ones who devised more efficient means of killing human beings, to be heroes; nor should history judge Temple Grandin to be a savior of animals. If her concern for animals goes as deep as she claims it does, she should turn the wealth she garners from the meat industry against its practices, donating all of her meat industry earnings to animal rights causes. Ultimately that is the only way she can begin to free herself of the moral stain of responsibility for the brutal death of innocent creatures 
 I selected Time to Hunt after reading the thrilling reviews I read here. Boy, was I in for a thrilling disappointment. Though I  forced myself to finish reading Time To Hunt; I found the story to be flat out dull, boring, if not moronic in the descriptions used for the characters. I found nothing interesting, nor thrilling about Time to Hunt, it was just a complete of my reading pleasure 
 "One who doesn not believe in himself believes in God"  The burden of proof for God's existence falls on those who believe the unsubstantiated claim - this book answers nothing 
 No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education 
  "Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack I went out for a ride and I never went back"  yeah that's impressive... sorry to all his fan's, but I've hated this guy ever since the first time I heard those lyrics... jeez wot wuz that? 25 years?   even worse, the no talent shmuck won't go away...  tell ya what Bruce... don't catch on fire near me...  
 "The Hospital" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character.  The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller.  The medical profession can be lampooned but don't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film 
 Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.  Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again 
 Perhaps I was distracted when I heard these short stories, but they seemed to lack substance.  The characters seemed like passing shadows - I never knew them well enough to have any solid emotional attachment.  The stories  were all very short, and most felt incomplete.  If you are just starting  with Hemingway, try something else first.  If you like his style, I'm sure  you'll love this collection 
 The content is about as non-existent as the waistlines on those cartoon supermodels of the day. Maybe if you profiteers glued together a few more decades worth of content, it might be worth the price of the postage 
 Was very disappointed to realize that on my Tivo (series 3, but I don't think it matters) I got the 4:3 version.  NOT the widescreen version.    So of course it displays "windowboxed" instead of full screen.  Yeah, i can ZOOM the tv display but this degrades even further the image quality.  Not very pretty in the end.  Is this going to be the case for all Tivo downloads?  
 Despite liking a couple of his movies, I've never been a fan of Preston Sturges, and a second viewing of Unfaithfully Yours did nothing to change that. With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly `sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clichés clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband). Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise.  But the same could be said for much of the film. The idea of having the execution and resolution of Harrison's fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts (Rossini for murder, Wagner for mournful forgiveness, Tchaikovsky for suicide) is inspired, but it results in scenes that feel forced, as if at the mercy of a galley slave master's drumbeat. That the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn't help, as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half.  There are, however, two saving graces. One is the scene in private detective Edgar Kennedy's office, where Harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss. The scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays, but there's heart and humanity there that's lacking in too much of the rest of the film. But the film's genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal, one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies, not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life, character and human soul behind it. The loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise. 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 this is the worst scarface record to date weak beats,the homies suck.what happened to the original homies from the old rap-a-lot days.get the first my homies but dont buy this crap 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 As per usual, any woman who entertains an independent thought---one not handed down to her by the male establishment---is immediately suspect. It's not women who are making the world worse---it's the idiots currently in charge of the government, starting with the president and vice-president and continuing through Rove and DeLay and a herd of congressmen. I'm sorry that the conservatives think women should stay home and raise families and not poke their heads out of the kitchen or nursery. I'm sorry they believe gutsy women are the cause of all the ills in the universe. I feel sorry for them that they'll never experience the satisfaction that comes from being their own person, beholden to no one, because they have a paying job and a degree of independence. When the world comes to value "women's work" and makes raising kids, cleaning house and fixing meals a well-paid endeavor, I might think that women would be better off in the home. Until then, I'm not buying it. Viva to those Women Who Make The World Worse! To those who would turn back the hands of time to the 1800s when women were chattel, Raspberries by the score.   People like Kate O'Beirne scare me no end 
 Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it 
 Heinz Edelmann, the designer of the 'The Beatles Yellow Submarine' film, suggested a brief group statement from a core group of co-creators of the film regarding Al Brodax's rendering of Yellow Submarine history in his new book, Up Periscope Yellow.  The statement is as follows:  "We do not consider Up Periscope Yellow by Al Brodax to be either a fair or an accurate book.  We would also like to protest on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, like the late George Dunning.  As far as the truth can be reconstructed about how the Yellow Submarine film was made, Dr. Bob Hieronimus did it in his book, Inside The Yellow Submarine."  Signers to this statement as of August 26, 2004 are: Heinz Edelmann, Art Director Bob Balser, Animation Director Jack Stokes, Animation Director Charlie Jenkins, Special Sequences director Jack Mendelsohn, one of the Screenplay writers Lee Minoff, original story and one of the Screenplay writers Roger McGough, uncredited Screenplay writer Max Wilk, author of the novelized version of Yellow Submarine  In addition, several co-creators sent their own personally worded statements.  Sir George Martin, Musical Director, said: "I am completely sympathetic to the points that [Edelmann] make[s] about 'Yellow Submarine'.  My experience on the film happily was not the same as Heinz Edelmann or the marvelous people at TVC.  My main liaison was with George Dunning who I found to be inspirational.  I am convinced that George's genius was the principal reason for the enormous success of the film, and he made it into the icon that it became."  John Coates, Production Supervisor, and head of TV Cartoons and Norman Kauffman, Assistant to Animation Director, said as a quote from TVC, "Al Brodax's book is part pure fiction, but at 78 his memory is obviously no longer reliable."  Heinz Edelmann, Art Director, added: "Part of this book is pure fiction, and we are not really amused by all of this.  It is connected only in the most tenuous sense to the reality of the production."  Bob Balser, Animation Director added: "Hooray!  All we can say is that You Are So Right!!!  And thank you for defending us all."   Other animators and artists are expected to be added soon 
 I was very disappointed in this book, but it's not terrible.  If 2.5 stars were an option, I would have chosen it, but I couldn't justify rounding up.  The reviewer who wrote "Two years and this is it?" hit the nail on the head.  I've read Michael Holley's column before and liked it, so I'm surprised he couldn't derive more insight out of his tenure as a fly on the wall in Foxborough.  The book is an easy read and has some good anecdotes, particularly about the departures of Bill Parcells and Drew Bledsoe.  There are some good stories about Belichik (I loved the unprintable comment Belichik made to Tom Jackson after the Super Bowl).  But I expected a little more analysis about what really sets Belichik and the Patriots apart.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed.  This book contained the startling insights that Belichik is very smart, works very hard, and expects the same of his players and coaches.  I could get that from reading any random column by Bob Ryan or Nick Cafardo, and they don't need two-year sabbaticals to figure it out.  The book isn't very well-written either.  It reads like it needed one more draft before publication.  There were times when I had to re-read a paragraph to figure out to whom pronouns were referring, which shows some lazy writing and editing.  Overall, it's not awful but it sure could, and should, have been better 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 Kaniut repeats the same story 200-300 times. A man or woman bumps  into a bear. The bear tears the man or woman to pieces. You get all the gross details about their injuries. They speculate about what went wrong. To me, this is like reading a book about 300 car accidents. There's an accident. You get to read clinical descriptions about the injuries people suffer. The survivors speculate about what went wrong. Just as people in auto accidents tend to blame the other driver, the people in Kaniut's bear tales tend to blame the bear for the accident. As a rule, the people injured by bears in Alaska Bear Tales don't know the first thing about bears, so you, the reader, get bombarded with inaccurate, biased information about bears. All the negative comments about bears add up; this book portrays bears as monsters or demons.  
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I give it two stars for holding my attention to the end. But after the ending, I just felt let down by the movie: it didn't make sense and it wasn't even likeable. 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 "Execution" was as interesting as this one is useless. Don't buy. it is only blablabla! As always in movies, sequels are not as good as the original. However, I highly recommend their first book "Execution: the discipline of getting things done".  
 From Raising Arizona to ... this?  Actually, I was raised with the good advice that "if you don't have anything nice to say about someone or something then don't say anything at all" - advice which I must admit I haven't followed with all that much regularity.    But in the case of Dr. Kitei's ... memoir, I will try to make an exception.  Currently, there are two books dealing with the fascinating events known as the Phoenix lights.  Neither of them satisfactorily document this series of UFO sightings with sufficient detail or descriptive rigor. However, Mr. Hamilton's The Phoenix Lights Mystery is the superior effort and the only one worth reading.   I say this without any animosity towards Lynne Kitei.  Dr. Kitei certainly put a lot of herself into the writing of this book. Unfortunately, way too much to make it interesting for a reader who is primarily curious about discovering whatever it was that did happen in and around Phoenix.    
 "Cursed" is the most pathetic werewolf movie I've seen since "An American Werewolf in Paris".  The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling.  The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience.  This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is "cool", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for "Cursed".  Well, at least it's not as bad as "An American Werewolf in Paris", but that sure as hell isn't saying much.  
 I was assigned this book as preparation for an A.P. English class, and I was incredibly disappointed with it. Although it features some stirring stories of bravery and compassion (hence the two stars), every word of it is poured over with syrup and then carelessly vomited onto the page. Only about half of the words in this book are necessary at all to the context of the stories it tells; the rest are flag-waving literary masturbation. Consider sentences like these:  "Millions of men and women were involved in this tumultous journey through adversity and achievement, despair and triumph. Certainly there were those who failed to measure up, but taken as a whole this generation did have a 'rendezvous with destiny' that went well beyond the outsized expectations of President Roosevelt when he first issued that call to duty in 1936."  Yes, I get it, Grandma and Grandpa were great! Now please, sir, learn how to structure a sentence! Most of the rest of the book is mindlessly self-indulgent treacle in this repetitive vein. How this man got a book deal is comprehensible to me only because I know how famous Brokaw is, but how any sadly misinformed American bought this book is more than beyond me. Please, if you respect yourself as a human being, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 The hyperbole won't seem appropriate to most people, but for me this was the single most un-enjoyable movie I've ever seen, ever. Every aspect of it was painful.   First, the production values: this movie is just ugly. I guess the biological computers are supposed to be a novel or deep concept, but it's just disgusting and really very poor looking. At times I thought they just rooted through the medical examiner's dumpster to gather props. I understand that you can't really have nice props in a low-budget movie, but with the setting and technology so central to the plot you think they could've paid for a decent production designer. Everyone says this is not a "special effects" movie and that the ideas behind it are what counts, but plenty of low budget movies didn't look this bad and were able to convey something new.  The acting: just one thing in a sea of annoyances here was Jude Law's accent. It's terrible, and he lets his native one slip several times. It's distracting and sloppy. The dialogue was just bad overall, so I blame the writer for most of this.  This movie is not "misunderstood." It's an objectively bad movie. It's unentertaining, boring, and scrabbling for a significance that only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors will care about and dogmatize. A lot of reviews said it was better to see it as a black comedy, but this movie is only unintentionally funny, if at all. I'd give it zero stars if I could, as I'm trying to warn people away from this turd 
 The party of hate just don't get it. Their obligation to preserve, protect, and defend this nation takes a backseat to their personal and political pursuits.... they foolishly and relentlessly attack and undermine the very policies and institutions that have made our country a beacon of liberty and prosperity. They've wasted decades vehemently slandering conservatives as "extreme" and "dangerous"-conservatives who make it their life-long mission to stand up for the rule of law, a growing economy, small government, and a strong "@$$ whipping" military... This author still dosn't see (because he's blinded by HATE,) the true danger-or what we need to do about them... I already know what needs to be done to protect the future of this country, for my children, my children's children, and yes, you libs'... You may not want to admit it but since September 11, 2001, it was clear to the world: AMERICA IS AT WAR... so get out of the way and AT LEAST let the military protect us from your stupid interferences and terrorist who want to harm us... you are doing more harm than good and it is clear (crystal) that we have not been attacked since 9/11 thanks to our troops... (Do you think you can go about your days if the war was here, right now? Think about that one.) Quit trying to tie the President's hands with pointless, pathetic, political arguments. It's a lot of talk, but you ain't sayin' nothin' 
 This cd was garbage the only song i liked was street lights and that;s just because the chorus was ok. i bought this cd because the source gave it 4 out of 5 mics. it was just garbage. after i bought it i gave it to my brother and he did not like it eithe 
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 This is a "goody-goody" Ronald Reagan propaganda style film. By that I mean that it tries to portray the US as the good guys being hit by the bad ones. It doesn't say what dirty role the US CIA had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis Islam, how it set up, equipped and nurtured not only Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, but a whole bunch of other loathsome Islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe - like the Islamic Brotherhood and the Taliban for instance: all just to defeat the USSR, and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions, to fuel the greedy American consumerist lifestyle which US citizens take so much for granted. I am not a "conspiracy theorist"; these people are usually an absurd breed, going off at the other extreme tangent. I live in Peshawar, the hotbed of CIA mischief in the 1980s and 90s (and even now), and the area where I live - the University Town - housed all the actors on this stage: the US officials and spies, their clubs, the Afghan "Mujahideen" leaders' houses, etc. etc... I grew up seeing all this going on literally next door, and so would like to apprise my American friends of the unpleasant truth. The National Geographic and the Reader's Digest magazines are two long established icons of US media culture that have served as the unofficial (and therefore hard to suspect) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous US propaganda drives... Never trust their political commentaries, although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice.. 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 Stupid reviews are written by stupid people, and the reviewer Steve Morse is indeed stupid.  Five stars for Judas Priest??  Is he on crystal meth?  Somebody please tie both his hands so that he may never type another review again 
 Some time in the future, historians will look back on the 2nd half of the 20th Century and wonder what spurred an otherwise enlightened society to lap up dreck like _Against Our Will_ as though it actually had any merit.   It is difficult to imagine that the author actually intended to enlighten anyone with this bombastic, stilted, sophomoric garbage. The Feminazis who will read this are already convinced that men are the root of all evil. Open-minded women with a shred of intelligence and critical thinking will recognize the arguments as spurious, the vocabulary as inflammatory and the "evidence" contrived to support pre-determined points. I can only conclude that the author intended to provoke and titillate, much like Jose Canseco's recent tell-all.  The quality of research that went into this book rivals that of an Oliver Stone film or a 9/11 conspiracy film. Apart from being an excellent example of poor journalism, the main value of this book is that it will help fill up the "men are pigs" section of your library.  Save your money for horoscope readings or something else more credible 
 Claiming to have recovered what the church has lost since the days of Augustine, Gregory Boyd proposes an alternate view to spiritual warfare that looks at our struggles through lenses that deny the sovereignty of God.  Readers should be alarmed when a modern theologian writes off nearly 1500 years of orthodox thinking to formulate his new ideas.  Rejecting the traditional view that God is unchanging through time and that God knows the future (see page 49), Boyd's book offers little hope when we find ourselves in the battles.  For example, in speaking of Job he talks about how God was "surprised" at what occurred (page 147).  Despite claims of having a high view of Scripture, Boyd's treatment of the text shows otherwise.  He speaks of Isaiah "reworking the cultural stories" to create his biblical accounts (159).  Boyd goes on to claim that much of the Old Testament conceptions of Satan are merely the reworking of pagan myths.  If all Scripture is really God breathed (see 2 Timothy 3:16), I personally struggle to see how such words are adaptations of pagan myths.    In light of the dismissal of orthodox understandings on spiritual warfare, God, and the Bible, what does a reader take away from God at War?  The reader can only come away with a sense that there is a theological dualism where the opposing forces of God and Satan are battling for an undecided outcome (a view that is in clear contrast to the decisive victory of God seen in Revelation).  As a result, the book presents little more than the idea behind the Star Wars movies - You have the force and dark side competing without a clear sense of who will ultimately win and without a god being in control of all things.  Such a conclusion is a natural outcome of Boyd's belief.  If you are not familiar with Boyd, he is a prominent open-theist, an individual who believes that God does not know the future.    Not all is bad in this book.  Boyd does make a strong case for the necessity of prayer.  He also recognizes the reality of spiritual warfare and the demonic, something many evangelical Christians ignore.  However, such truths are overshadowed by the misconstrued notions as God as not knowing the future, parts of Scripture resulting from pagan myths, and a theology of warfare that more resembles a Hollywood movie than the God of the Bible.  In light of these problems it is hard to recommend God at War to you.  As an alternative, let me suggest Chuck Lawless' books Spiritual Warfare (from Lifeway Publishers) and Discipled Warriors (from Kregal Publications).  Both recognize the reality of warfare but do so with biblical support and in a way that glorifies God and helps us live for His glory 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket... 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 While "1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work" was an interesting read at first but I eventually put it down for several weeks before forcing myself to continute.  While some stories can give at least a hint of an idea if not an actual suggestion on how to step up on the job, 98% of this book seems redundant and lacking. If you're looking for, as on reviewer said, "Chicken Soup for the Employee's Soul" you've found it. If you are looking for something to guide you into being a better employee and coworker, move on 
 I have read this book through and through, and I have read the brief review pannning the book and the response by the author, Eugene Taylor. I had two reactions: First, I found the author's "rebuttal" rather  spooky. It was a mean-spirited response, not at all polite or -- dare I say  -- spiritually enlightened, although the author hints at his own ability to  see into the great beyond and to know more than the rest of us who are not  blessed with such . . . experiences. He is apparently thin-skinned, and  perhaps, after I read this book, I now see that he has reason to be. Which  brings me to my second point, my review of the book: I found myself in  total agreement with the reviewer from Lincoln, Mass. I'm sorry to say  this, but the book is boring. And repetitive. And offers a thesis that is  not very original at all. I have read many books on the history of New Age  spirituality, and this is just so-so 
 I really wanted to like this album, I really did. I love "Come Clean" and I was in anticipation of this, but when I got it I couldn't believe how bland and uncreative it was. It sounds like it was thrown together in ten minutes. The only reason i give it two stars is for the songs "Away From Me" and "Sydney" that's it. The rest of this CD is awful. This band can do much better than this. I am, however still a fan, I just the hope the next album (If there ever is one) shows me a little more 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 I was disappointed to learn this card won't work with Windows Vista.  I bought the router + card together in hopes of getting broader coverage even though it isn't fully standards-compliant ("Pre-N").  I contacted support about the issue and they sent me instructions that didn't work out.  Might be a good product for WindowsXP, but for my purposes I rate it 1 star 
 This is not the book which I wanted to order.....this is the cram footnotes, which incidentally is also the title,Cram101 Textbook Outlines. Nowhere in the ad does it mention this.  I was had 
 Yes, indeed! The booklet included is nice and glossy. Thanks! And the two documentaries added this time around are nice too. Thanks again! But what about the film itself? Has that been given the deluxe treatment as well? Sad answer: Definitely NOT! As a matter of fact, this new "re-master" looks much worse than the previous DVD. That one was a very fuzzy non-anamorphic mess, but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy. In fact, when I put the old one in the zoom mode, there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever. And the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition. But worst of all, is that the new DVD is cropped on all four sides! There is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc, especially on top of the frame! So much for a Deluxe Edition! Shame on you, Sony/MGM-UA! Fans of this film - myself included - will have to keep the old DVD, and get this new one for the extras and the booklet. (The 2 stars above are for those inclusions alone.) This is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
 I saw Gogol Bordello on the Vans Warped tour and was really impressed.  They had a great live show so I rushed off and bought this CD.  When I first got it I was completly disapointed to hear this blend of disco-hip-hop-gypsy music.  I wanted the more punk influenced music they had at their live show.  But after a while this CD grew on me and I don't completly hate it 
 I checked this book out from my local library because Dadaism was mentioned in my Design class, and it sounded interesting.  I wanted to learn more about it.  I found this book to be very confusing and not very  informative at all.  It seems that they wrote this so abstract on purpose  (which they may have).  Although the final essay, lecture on dada, was  informative and the essay was, on poetry, was very good.  I'd recommend  this book just for those two lampistries 
 One of the fun aspects of reading serial mystery series is that there are actually two things that you follow as the reader. The first is the murder mystery that is the point of the story and that you try to match wits with the detective and try to identify the perpetrator - i.e. the "whodunit" aspect. The second is that you get involved with the repetitive characters and follow their lives and developments.  The Joe Grey mysteries are no different in this respect in that early on in the series we learned about Joe's and Dulcie's remarkable abilities and we see them exercise these in every volume as they solve the various crimes that are committed in and around Molena Point.  In Cat to the Dogs, we have essentially only half of a book. Oh, I do not mean that you only read 100 pages instead of 200! No, what I mean is that you only get to read the soap opera aspects and there is no mystery!  The book starts with the murder and the reader knows that Joe Grey knows within the first five pages that there was a murder and that it was committed by a man. By the end of the first chapter you already know who the murdere was although his full name is not revealed until later on in the book.   The author tries to compensate for this by throwing in one more murder and two attempted murders as well as several other crimes, but all the mystery of "whodunit" is completely and utterly missing.  So, if you want to know more about Clyde, Charlie, Wilma, Max Harper and the rest of the gang; if you want to read the volume that introduces Kit to the mix, then this is one you want to read. If, on the other hand, you do not have the background on the base characters and their locations, and do not care to read more about these remarkable critters, then you can safely leave this one behind. 
 All i know is that if anyone says anything about Ashkenazi Jews, they are demonized as hatemongers and anti-semitic.  look up the word anti semitic, and one discovers that arabs are also " semitic"  only people who are from the tribe of judah are jews ( different story) and the turkish europeans who converted to the religion are not remotely connected to ancient israel.  also zionism is distinctly different from Judaism,   ie, trotsky baruch perle wolfiwitz etc, and needs to be stopped   sorry ford was right 
 [Joshua 6:23,21]Joshua said to the people of Israel, "The Lord has given you the city of the all silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the Lord: They shall come into the treasury of the Lord. The people utterly DESTROYED ALL THAT WAS IN THE CITY, BOTH MAN AND WOMAN,YOUNG AND OLD, AND OX AND SHEEP, AND ASS, WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD.   Deuteronomy 17:3-5 "And he should go and worship other gods and bow down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, .....and you must stone such one with stones and such one must die."   Romans 1:20-32 ....32. "Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."   Numbers 31: And the Lord said unto Moses, "Avenge the children of the Mid'-an'ites.. They warred against the Mid'-i-an'ites, as the Lord commanded Moses, and they slay all the males. And they took all women as captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. Moses said, "HAVE YOU SAVED ALL THE WOMEN ALIVE? NOW KILL EVERY MALE AMONG THE LITTLE ONES, AND KILL EVERY WOMAN that has known a man by lying with him, but all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves."   [Quran-60:8-9] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable towards them. GOD loves the equitable. GOD enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others to banish you. You shall not befriend them. Those who befriend them are the transgressors. 
 This book is way out of date. The good thing about it is that we can read it and look back at how much things have changed since 1983 when it was published.  Another good thing about it is that we can look back and see how much things stay the same.  The same battles are happening today, but it does seem that, all in all, Cal's Moral Majority is more on the defensive now, whereas the so-called secular humanists seem to have gained ground in 20 years.

 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 Leslie Downer is a cultural tourist who set out to "play geisha"-- as seen in her cheezy author's photographs, being servile to a Japanese gentleman-- an insult to a profession of exquisite grace and artistry that requires YEARS of intensive training!  Both the author's information and her perspective on it are highly suspect!  She has a remarkable degree of thinly veiled disrespect for the culture she sets out to study, continually complaining about the rudeness of the Japanese when she's the person who approaches them rudely in the first place, with a condescending view of geisha!  She also goes to great length to try to convince the reader of her expertise, and how little scholarship has been done on the subject-- and cites well-respected works by others in her bibliography, ones that far surpass her understanding of the subject.  Case in point: Jodi Cobb's photo-journalistic opus GEISHA. It intimately captures the world and mood of a realm Downer tries to describe without ever realy experiencing-- and without the arrogant self-insert 
 Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!  
 If you want to feel good about your bigotry against Gay Americans, read this book. This book does nothing to help you understand Gay Americans or why they deserve to be treated -- in all respects -- with the same kind of dignity and love you would hope for yourself 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 Charlie Sheen,who is now on CBS' hit comedy "Two and a Half Men",once played the reborn alien form of Sherilynn Fenn's boyfriend in this '80s cheese-fest.Unlike his character on the sitcom,he can incinerate bad guys with his eyes--and wear a really bizarre leather outfit.I found the reborn boyfriend/alien wraith concept confusing,maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense in the first place.  Randy Quaid,before playing the rancher in "Brokeback Mountain",plays a cop who wonders what's going on.Who expects local cops to understand the supernatural?  There are wonderfully strange '80s hairdos,'80s music--it's a cheesy sci fi/teen angst space epic.How many of those exist?It's "The Breakfast Club" meets "Alien." Be prepared to be amused 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 I was hoping this would be the ideal soother for my son's room, but the thing made a grinding mechanical noise once I put the batteries in. I returned it the next day. I would not recommend this product, nor would I purchase anything from this company again. The toy appears to be cheaply made, and the grinding mechanical noise told me that they probably used sub standard parts, I began to worry that this thing might even catch fire if I kept it in my house 
 I originally read this book for a class in college, but was unable to  finish it due to deadlines.  With more time on my hands, I picked up the  book recently and attempted to read through it.  I found the book had a  great deal of history, including names, dates, and facts that are difficult  to find elsewhere.  However, the book was very difficult to read due to the  style.  It was very long and monotonous and I found myself getting very  bored with it at times.  Lewis should have written with a style that  engaged the reader more since many of the interesting facts were lost in  the endlessly long discussions about each black writer.  Also, the book  included many of the writers in the Harlem Rennaissance, but it barely  talked about Harlem at all.  Many of the writers during the Harlem  Rennaissance did not even live in Harlem.  It seemed to be more of a  history about African Americans in the literary world at that time.  I  picked up the book because I wanted to read about Harlem -- not the Harlem  Rennaissance.  I wanted to read about the everyday residents of Harlem.   Overall, the book had some interesting facts, but it is a very boring read  and very difficult to sift through.  If you ever got bored reading your  history textbooks, I would not recommend this book since it is written in  the same style 
 I have spent a lot of time with the Renovare Spiritual Formation Bible over the past two months.  I am disappointed. I bought the Bible primarily because of my appreciation of Richard Foster's previous works, especially The Celebration of Discipline. I had never spent much time with a NRSV translation before, and this translation is my main disappointment with the Renovare Bible.  The National Council of Churches' energetic attempt to completely remove gender-related words and language in the NRSV has given this translation a strong "politically correct", rather than "inspirationally correct", tenor. I have had to conclude that the NRSV translation is basically dishonest with respect to the original inspirations of the Greek and Hebrew.     So, I found myself using my favorite translation, the ESV, with the Renovare's Spiritual Discipline Index and Suggested Ways to Use (the Renovare Bible) for Spiritual Formation.  That works, but I would just as soon have the Index, Suggested Ways, along with the generally good Introduction and With-God sections, as stand-alone material. The online downloadable guide (at Renovare's website), "Studies in the With-God Life. Exploring the Renovare Spiritual Formation Bible" by Jan Johnston is also useful - you can still pursue the subject of spiritual formation by substituting another translation and eliminating the NRSV.   As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is a distinct flavor of ecumenism and pantheism in many of the introductions and profiles done by the 51 contributors.   
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 If he would have done any research at all, he would have found that no one ever "ordered" the library at Alexandria to be sacked. It caught fire during a naval battle quite by accident. Its unfortunatly true because nothing or at least very little made it out.  No narative I have ever read or heard of has ever claims otherwise. Ceasar was not the type to either sack or torch a library 
 This extremely expurgated version sells for about a dollar a minute! So if you think a 15 minute (estimate) feature is worth the price, by all means, buy this. If not, save yourself the heartbreak I suffered 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)  For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her  into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!  Stupidity not worthy of further commentary 
 I was tricked into buying this Soundtrack because the label that keeps it sealed had "Ghost in the Shell Soundtrack."  The problem is that nonoe of the music from the "Stand Alone Complex" series is on it.  Most of the music is cheap techno, none of the good stuff from the series.  The songs are thankfully short, but only one is even worth listening to.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM 
 This book fails so miserably compared to the first one I am shocked.  I don't know what was going on in the author's head, but seeing the supposed "Gods" act like fools and idiots just made the whole world seem unbelievably shallow  .  Whenever you read about Takhisis, you knew "HERE IS POWER" but these little godlings are pretty bad.  It is like that David Eddings book that is about the Gods and treats them as regular characters that we are supposed to empathize with.  This book just fails.  The plight of the main character (NOT MINA) is pretty lame, and yea the kender is interesting but call him Tasslehoff and I wouldn't know the difference.    
 I'm new to PHP and MySQL, but a programmer for over 3 decades. I'm customizing some PHP code, using code examples for ideas. When I (a) see something I want to understand better or (b) want to find the PHP analog for basic functions, I naturally turn to the index to try to find the information I need. However, I found the index very disappointing because of what it doesn't have. For example, simple and basic keywords are not in the index: "comment", "logical operator", "and", "or", etc. I'm going to have order a different book as a PHP reference 
 I read this to help with pain.  As we all know, for "pain go to a chiropracter for help". Well, this got me interested in the scientific evidence to support chiropractic care.  The support is not there - basically a faith based treatment for pain, which will work 30% of the time, as good as a sugar pill.  There is no scientific evidence to support this book. Nothing helped my pain, so I'll look elsewhere.  Sorry I couldn't be positive 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language 
 This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.  Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!  I downgraded back to Irritator 10 
   I never recieved this item.  If you could look into it for me  I would like to have it thoug 
 ...it probably is.  This is a valueless book with a title designed to sell.  I got this from the library and read the first section then listened to the CD per the instructions.  I don't think it hypnotized me, nor do I think it helped me quit in any way.   I've since found some good books on dealing with the nicotine addiction like the disease it is.  It's not a question of will power, or hypnotizing your mind to not want to smoke.  It's an extremely strong addiction that will take months to recover from.  Once you accept that - it's a lot easier.  
  I didn't get this order, did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf. number and when the credit was given.   
 As the previous reviewer stated, it is the same dog coat over and over and it is not even that good of a design.  The same can be said for the baby clothes too. I'm glad I got it used and cheap.  The toys are cute, but the rest of the book isn't good at all 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 this book basically has nothing you cant find online, get a better book that tells you more about the college itself,  like college prowler, and then look up the film program information onlin 
 As a graduate student specializing in religion I found this book wanting. If you're looking for a "soft" approach to finding spirituality in popular culture, then this book may be for you. Despite the autho'rs credentials this minimally researched book acts more as a stepping stone to creative thinking about identifying basic Buddhist concepts in fantasy writing than a serious attempt at scholarly inquiry. Often the connections are weak, but I commend Roy for his attempt because the field definitely needs more books that attend to Buddhist themes in popular culture. Instead, I would refer readers to the "Philosophy and XX" series that looks at specific movies/books such as The Matrix, The Lord of the Ring trilogy or The Simpsons 
 Let me start by explaining the title of my review: being an Indian (settled in India, not outside) I am incessantly perplexed by the plethora or completely rubbish books from India which the West just can't seem to get enough of. Books which say nothing about India, and are not about it. Just books set in India, which throw in some curry and some local language, and somehow thus make people fall all over themselves in an attempt to praise the book. My gut revolts against such partisanship, and this is one of those books which is a perfect example of this rubbish trend, and hence is going to get such deserving treatment at my hands.  But let me start by going back a bit in time and giving credit where it's due: after reading his first two books, I came to the very early conclusion that Vikram Chandra was the narrator's Narrator, a storyteller of uncommon brilliance, a weaver of magic tales. On the flip side, like most other Chandra fans, I too was frustrated by his ability to end every one of his stories in the worst all of all possible ways; but I loved his craft nonetheless. I had almost convinced myself that with his next book, I'd stop about 10% before the end of the book, and with Sacred Games, that promise turned out to be very easy to fulfill - I managed to put the book down without dying of guilt about halfway through itself.  Sacred Games is a book about nothing: there are no characters who feel real, it is not about the protagonists' environment, it doesn't rotate around or shed new light on any events, and it doesn't deal with any objects of fascination. Nothing. Nil. Zilch. Nada. A lot of people have talked about this as another of the, if not the definitive Bombay book, but having lived there myself, I can vouch for the fact that this book doesn't even begin to capture an iota of the character or the essence of Bombay. (If you really want to read about the city, read "Shantaram" - now that's a book!) In fact, I think one of the lowest points of the book is how it fails to create any context - the events of this book could almost have happened anywhere, at almost any point in time. (And no, that does not make it timeless - just outright insipid.) Simple mechanisms like linkages to some real-life events would have given the reader something to hold on to - but no, Mr. Chandra refuses to give any straws to the drowning. Reviewers have gone ga-ga over it's portrayal of the Bombay Mafia, but there is nothing said here which is even remotely new, and there isn't the slightest different twist to it. Dons, corrupt policemen, actors, dancing girls, slums, and smuggling - everything has been told, and told much better.   A stunningly stupid highlight of this book is the copious usage of local language without any glossary to help the readers understand what the terms mean. I have almost been a local there, and though I understood most of the local or slang language, there were terms which bewildered even me. I understand that Mr. Chandra believes that this deliberate omission of explanations draws you into the story, but when there are 10 or more such words per page, it will leave a lot of readers more irritated than intrigued.  Overall, I would strongly recommend avoiding this book. The Indians because there is nothing here that you don't know or can't read about in a better written book, and the rest because this is not about India -it's just a forced nowhere story. Save your money and your time. Go buy or read something else. 
 I immediately found the page design of this book disturbing. There are blurbs and comments all over the margins, and bits of story and anecdotes without any explanation. It is a real ADD kind of lay out, and made the book as a whole rather difficult to read. The book could have benefitted from a real editor. Going forward, there were a wide assortment of assertions in the book which were plain old opinion- there is not a lot of support for some of the declarations about learning, supplements, and even what FAS is.  It appeared that the author often attributed to FAS behaviors which have every appearance of actually being manifestations of BiPolar.  The various interventions the family experiemented with seemed spur of the moment, and not terribly effective. It is also concerning that the family has encouraged the child to become a sort of poster child for FAS, with what impact on her privacy?  I can only hope that there are better resources out there for families who need solid, science based and effective interventions for kids with fetal alcohol effects 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 While a potentially interesting topic, the authors bored me.  The consistantly repeat themselves.  I don't know how many times I was told we know the furture because our authors have studied the past!  The science was burdened with pseudo-short stories of past and future Earths which often turned out to be directly related to our authors.  I felt the actual scientific content here presented could have been presented in a quarter of the pages much more clearly.  After reading it in two nights I am left with a feeling of a mind numbed through repeated mental bludgeoning 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 This book was not what I expected.  I was looking for travel tips for traveling with my 1 year old child.  I found page after page of anecdotes of other parents taking their kids to zoos around the world.  If you are looking tips on what to bring/ how to travel I would recommend Rick Steve's "Europe through the Back Door."  His traveling with kids section is much more pratical 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 This movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor.  Are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny?  Sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society.  I'm not a stiff when it comes to humor, but I trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with Fox.  Fox Network is a base for right-wing Republican stupidity.  This movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities.  I think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of American humor have gone.  Hurray for the 1st amendments and others our Four Fathers came up with, I think they were brillant men.  I am all for Free-Speech but I believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public.  This film definitely over stepped its boundaries.  For all those people who loved this movie...why are there sooooo many (around 180) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago!?!?!  I thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto...Just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents 
 This toaster was not up to snuff for a variety of reasons. It did not toast bread evenly; the toast was dark on top but virtually untoasted on the bottom. Secondly, it had a bagel feature which left the bagels very light when bagels should be very dark. Despite these deficiencies, the product did have one redeeming feature. The handle that allowed one to lift the toast out of the toaster to varying heights was very handy and unique compared to many other toasters. 
 This author is just in it for the money, very poor book 
 I don't like the stones. they are overrated and don't make good music. I only like their 2 good songs in start me up, and shattered and that's it. other than that, don't buy any other rolling stones cd who are terrible. Thanks 
 Did not like this film at all and felt it was a big dissappointment. 
 I am actually returning this book because I couldn't stand it anymore.  It skips around so much I actually looked to see if my copy was missing pages.  The Tiny One was one of my favorites, but this style of writing is not working for this book.  
 I found this book to be very disappointing. For one thing, it is very generic, offering no real, specific advice that you couldn't have thought of yourself. But my main problem with it is that it is all over the place; for example, the chapter on "Selecting the Right Mortgage" is three chapters after the chapter on "Making the Offer to Buy" and two chapters after the one on "Learning from Disclosures on a Home Inspection." Sure, as long as you know the order in which you should read this book (Chapters 1, 4, 3, 11, 12, 2, 7, 6, 13, 5, 8, 15, 17, 14, 16), it's not too confusing. But why bother with the maze? Go ahead and spend the extra $6 on "Home Buying for Dummies," which I found to be a thousand times better than "Buy Your First Home. 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more 
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 We all have bad days, but what was Robin Cook thinking in allowing this book to be published?  It is full of errors, and the plot just doesn't come together.  The ending is not plausible. If you decide to read it, check it out from the library, don't spend your money!  Sorry,  Mr. Cook, it's not up to your usual standards 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 I just got these dvd's today and none of them work I have 2 memorex dvd drive witl the firmwere up to date a 2.4 and 16X and the 2.4 burn error and the 16x burns, but the disk never reads I have tryed all speed be got no results I already wasted 5 out of 100 dvdr and I know none of them will work. 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it.  It was terrible!  Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.  
 I bought this book looking for something that would tell me things I didn't know about Disney (I've been to WDW countless times and love everything Disney).  And while there were things I didn't know presented in the book, they weren't things that I found terribly interesting.  What you get on each page of this book is a brief statement of fact...like #48's "A former test car from Test Track can be seen in the ride's gift shop at the exit" or #89's "Africa is represented by the fictional village of Harambe."  After this you get a paragraph (i.e. not alot) on the statement.  For #89, you're told about the real village in Kenya that Harambe is based on.  There is then a 'furthermore' section which may/may not be related to the info on the page.  For example #89's furthermore section is on technology that can't be displayed and the authors talk about a 'makeshift insulator' which is really a Coca-Cola bottle.  This is supposed to be 'a nod to both the inventiveness of African towns and the longtime sponsorhip of Disney parks by the Coco-cola company.'  If that isn't a stretch I don't know what is.  As another reviewer said, there's little meat to this book and perhaps that's what didn't hold my interest.  The one paragraph of info really did not give alot of info and the furthermore sections were hit or miss about pertaining directly to what was on the page.  I read through the book once and put it away as I don't think it's a good reference 
 This is anything but a "historical inquiry" into the New Testament accounts of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is at best "historical speculation," and Lï¿½demann's conclusions are little more than assertions based on his arbitrary, atomistic textual critical methodology and anti-supernatural presuppositions.  To Lï¿½demann, development from one gospel to the next is evidence of distortion. This is apparent in his discussion of the tradition of Joseph of Arimethea. Lï¿½demann is quite troubled that each of the gospels portrays Joseph in increasingly glowing terms. Although one could interpret this development as simply the progressive inclusion of more information, Lï¿½demann arbitrarily declares these accounts suspect as a result.   Lï¿½demann also dismisses any positive reconstruction of the ending of the gospel of Mark, yet insists on a negative reconstruction of the resurrection chapters in John's gospel. He admits that Mark's gospel ends with a preposition in the Greek, yet insists that we must consider the text as it has come to us without speculating on a lost ending. Since he holds to Markan priority, he argues that the earliest tradition, therefore, records no resurrection appearances.   Yet Lï¿½demann is certain that we must not accept the received text of John chapter 20. He asserts that verse 11 does not chronologically connect with verses 1-10 and, therefore, declares verses 14-18 the imaginative insertion of the author, exhibiting a surprising bias against the nature of ancient biography and its often characteristically non-chronological nature. Furthermore, he insists that verses 19-23 contradict verses 24-28, since verses 19-23 do not mention that any of the disciples were missing when Jesus appeared to them, yet 24-28 declare that Thomas was missing. But verses 19-23 make no mention of the number of disciples present when Jesus appears. So how does the information in the succeeding passage constitute a contradiction? This is additional information, not contradictory information. Nonetheless, Lï¿½demann declares these passages unhistorical. Such arbitrary textual vivisection is characteristic of Lï¿½demann's method, and his arbitrary acceptance of Mark and rejection of John further reveal his bias.  Another example of Lï¿½demann's "historical" method appears in his discussion of the Sabbath Day meeting between the Jewish leaders and Pilate recorded in Matthew 27: 62-66. He considers the account of this meeting between "strict followers of the Jewish law" and the gentile Pilate as "incredible" and therefore historically "nil." Lï¿½demann does not tell us just which Sabbath law the Jewish leaders were breaking as a result of this meeting. Furthermore, the Sadducee's among this group had already proven themselves to be purely politically motivated. As for the Pharisee's among them, they had already been party to the arrest and condemnation of an innocent man by means of a bribe to an inside informer and an illegal trial in the middle of the night. At what point had these lawless co-conspirators suddenly become pristine law-abiders? Apparently, Lï¿½demann can easily accept that the New Testament writers had personal agendas in fabricating imaginative resurrection stories, but cannot fathom sinister chicanery among the Jewish leaders.   Finally, we come to Lï¿½demann's explanation of the resurrection appearances themselves. Leaning on the theories of modern depth psychology, Lï¿½demann psychoanalyzes the apostle Paul in order to explain his reported encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus. According to Lï¿½demann, Paul had a "Christ complex" emerging from his conflict between the alleged harshness of the Jewish law and the attractiveness of Christ's message of grace. This conflict supposedly came to a head when Paul had a purely subjective "vision" of Christ that resolved this conflict and changed his life. Furthermore, Lï¿½demann asserts that this "vision" represents the pattern of all the other recorded appearances of Jesus, although these appearances allegedly were more the result of the disciples' wishful thinking and the need to resolve their "guilt-complex" that resulted from deserting their master.    In response, we must first ask why, prior to Paul's conversion, there is no evidence in the text that he was unhappy with his life. He describes himself as one progressing in his Judaism and zealous for the Law. It appears that Paul was a quite well-adjusted, anti-Christian bigot. Secondly, we must ask what "wishes" the earlier disciples had that would have motivated such a "vision." There was no anticipation among them that their deceased Master would appear again, nor was there any place in their theology for a dead Messiah. Finally, Lï¿½demann fails to tell us how the experience of subjective visions translated into the disciples' unanimous proclamation that Jesus had risen bodily from the dead. There is no precedent in the Old Testament or Second Temple Jewish literature for such an interpretation of visions. Furthermore, Second Temple Judaism would seem to preclude such an understanding of visions, even if objective. "Resurrection" was understood by first century believing Jews to mean a physical event in space and time. So even if we grant that Paul saw a heavenly Christ, we are not compelled to believe that this was the experience of all the other disciples, nor are we compelled to believe that the Christ Paul saw was not embodied.*    In the end, Lï¿½demann's theory is based on historical and psychological speculation that find no support in the text. His is just another attempt to come up with a naturalistic explanation of the resurrection at any cost, since, to Lï¿½demann, a supernatural explanation, even if it remains the best explanation, is simply a priori unacceptable.  * For an exanded treatment of some of the thoughts in this paragraph, I recommend the book Jesus Resurrection, Fact or Figment: A Debate Between William Lane Craig and Gerd Lï¿½demann, ed. Paul Copan and Ronald K. Tacelli (Downers Grove, IL: Intervarsity Press, 2000).   
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 I have a bad record of choosing books from the Airport Bookstores. I have made some really attrocious choices. This one is not that bad, but I could not recommend it to anyone. If I would have read the inside flap I would have realised that Michael White was the "Science Editor of British GQ Magazine" --- I did not know that anyone who read GQ would be even interested in Science, but if they are, there taste would be light to the point of idiocy, like this book.   The title is inane enough. It lured me in like a sucker... I was interested in reading the counterpoint of what would be two personalities --- the Pope and Bruno. But the Pope does not even really appear in the book.  The main problem is twofold:  1) Lack of any discernable organisation. The book is a mess. It is hard to put together any discernable record of the like of Bruno after I read this --- was he in Frankfurt first and then Paris? Maybe it was the other way around?   This means that White mixes everything up, chronology, main themes and the roles of people in the book. Ideas are not at all well developed. There is a sometimes peurile feeling about his writing style: when an idea is developed a little he switches to other things --- one feels that he is writing at times for the attention span of a 12- yr-old reader.  2) Weak development of themes inside the book. Scholastic ossification of the ideas of the Catholic Church is a great topic, but White's starts with a description of how Aristotle was always wrong on everything... and vaguely brushes him off as an almost personal hindrance to development of ideas. Such comic-book interpretations really show a lack of mastery of his subject.  White intimates a tremendous importance for the hermetic tradition, although he keeps this significantly nebulous (something that a reader of GQ or Omni might be interested in). As usual his work verges towards veneration for mysticism.   At the end of the day he should have marshalled his forces with more discipline and spent the time on making this into a serious work that it should be, and as Bruno deserves. It appears that he merely cranked this one out. He will pay for this as readers such as I will never buy another of his books.   Back to the Thompson Twins Mr. White!    
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
 In spite of trying, I could not complete the 'Bitter Fruit'!   This is a story of a black middle-class family in post-apartheid South Africa. After years of struggle and deprivation they now enjoy material comforts, but events from the brutal past give them no peace of mind. The story of Silas family’s struggles to come to terms with the past, even as prosperity and equality beckons, is used as a metaphor for the dilemma in present-day South Africa.  While the Truth and Reconciliation Committee works to heal the society from the indignities of the apartheid-era, individuals must still confront their demons from the past in private.   In this story, Silas and his wife see their lives turned upside-down when he runs into a white policeman who raped her a long time ago. It is fertile territory for Mr. Dargor with his social activist background, but the result falls short 
 How sad that so many people have been fooled by a troubled woman who herself is being fooled by the demon spirits of the so-called New Age movement.  Satan transformed himself into an angel of light, bringing the forbidden fruit of knowledge.  How little things have changed since then. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This deck is odd, to each his own, I suppose. Firstly, swords and wands are transposed, with swords representing fire and wands representing air. This would be OK to work with, except the card meaning are not representative of the elements....the meanings of the swords are still equated with knowledge, intellect, thought, justice and truth...but are now associated with fire, rather than air. The wands cards represent creativity, action, movement, enthusiasm, and career....but are classed under the element of air....this is rather confusing to new readers who are used to the Rider-Waite associations.  The hierophant as elephant?? Surely that must be a joke.  I just can't take this deck seriously. I'd call it more bizarre than inspired. 
 I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny 
 Essentially, this book is in the same league as Michael D. Evans' "Showdown with Nuclear Iran": biased, bigoted and on many accounts, baseless. First they sold us Iraq with the claims that the then leader was a kakistocrat. Now, the same people are pushing for a war with Iran, claiming yet again that that country's present leader is worse than Lucifer. Timmerman is so hypocritical in trying to be 'fair' to his subject, it's laughable. There are better books on this subject and you can safely skip this slanted creed 
 i don't know to whom this book the author wrote. If you are a beginner, you must be confuse read it but if you are not a beginner again u won't get nothing from this book.There is no tip or trick. Trade for a living far better than this boo 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I read this to understand what had tipped an acquaintance over the edge. This attempts to guide lost souls towards a new way of thinking, but in fact provides justification for alienating those you know/love in the event that they dont see the light in the way that you do. The last third of the book is a poorly disguised manifesto for Mr Redfield's chosen 'church' of thought, and he is guilty of promising assistance, but is in fact providing a reason for self destructive people to alienate themselves further. He has claimed in the past this is merely a novel, but only those weak enough to be taken in by the book are fooled by this, shame on you, you have ruined more lives than you have saved 
 I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.   Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I didn't think needed to be reiterated.  A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down.  I was looking for more than that.  The advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation, how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process. There is false logic in some of the parental mistakes.  An example is always attributing "hovering parents" to ego issues, that a parent "needs to be needed".  Some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger.  False assumptions leads to false conclusions.   I gave this  2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense.  But it isn't helping my family.  
 Half way through I'm wondering if I want to finish this turkey.  And that's disappointing.  I really did like Stepsister.  I also believe Wicked is a stand alone work of art!  I recommend it to anyone I meet.  I love Mr. Maguire's twists on classic fairy tales.  I hope he's not being forced by the "powers that be" (publishing companies) to crank them out quicker than he is comfortable doing.  I'm sure it took a long time for him to create Wicked and fill in all those gaps and answer all those questions!  No stone was left unturned.  Perhaps he even had some of the questions already answered in his mind for "confessions'" Cinderella and Stepsister?  It just doesn't seem that Mirror Mirror is as well put together and researched as the others.  Therefore, it seems a little disjointed --- lacking in flow.  It also seemed like an awful lot of writing just for the sake of meeting a minimum word count.  I do hope Mr. Maguire has more time (or whatever else he needs ) in order to produce another Wicked.  Perhaps we, as readers, should also coinsider Wicked as a singualar work of art by this artist and not compare everything he writes against that benchmark?  Just an idea 
 Loftus is a witness for the defense for parents accused of abuse by adult children.  There is well established research which defines two types of memory.  Trauma memory is quite different than the memory that Loftus discusses here.  Dismissing repression as invalid, Loftus overlooks concrete evidence of dissociation, repression and later remembrance of traumatic abuse. An abused child can't deal with the trauma and they cope by shutting down (dissociating) and then forgetting (repression). This is survival for children. As adults in safe environments, those children are faced with what their subconscious always has remembered. These repressed memories are not always exact and precise, but they are corroborated in some cases. As an abused child, I know about repression. Its a coping device. We repress by drinking and drugging. People have developed post-traumatic stress disorder from abuse they don't "remember" the specifics of.  Loftus has her slant and she's entitled to it. There are always opposite sides of any fence

 I suppose it isn't fair to compare this version of The Great Gatsby to the 1974 version, which is one of my all-time favorite films, especially since the original soundtrack is once again intact. But this later version, even on it's own merit is absolutely awful and I found it almost painful to watch. It has a low budget look and though I am a fan of both Toby Stephens and Mira Sovino, I feel they are miscast. It has none of the outstanding production values (script, casting, set and costume design, cinemetography and soundtrack to name but a few) of it's predecessor. The entire cast of the '74 version is superb, but I must single out Sam Waterston, who is such a fine actor. After seeing him in the role of Nick Carraway, I can't imagine anyone else playing that role, as is the case with the rest of the cast and their respective roles, even the minor ones.  One scene I did want to specifically mention in the later version, mostly because it really sums up the contrast of the two films, was the scene where Myrtle is hit by Gatsby's car. I found it to be completely tastless and graphic. We then see her laid out in all her misshapen grotesqueness. Whereas the other film was able to recreate the scene perfectly in my mind's eye through hearing witnesses and Gatsby later relating the incident to Nick. We only see her covered with a blanket, as in the book.  I would only recommend watching this if you want to see the difference between great and mediocre film making. Seeing this made me long for the other version, which I promptly ordered. I would have given this new version "no stars" if they had that rating as I didn't find it entertaining, but a dreadful bore. If you're looking to purchase this, I would strongly recommend buying the 1974 version instead. And at $5.97 it is well worth the money 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 So much of 'Eternity Road' is ridiculous and contrived (beginning with the premise!) that it becomes annoying. Once I start reading a book, I like to finish it. In this case, I had a hard time not chucking the book at the wall or throwing it in the garbage with disgust. It may still end up in the trash. I suppose if it were recycled, it wouldn't be able to poison the environment. There has only been one other author that has been able to evoke such a negative response on my part, no matter how poorly written the material.   Starting with the concept of the novel, why would a group of scholars rate a work of fiction so highly? When the world has been largely destroyed, information on how to rebuild or some explanation of what happened should be far more important. The novel also doesn't adequately explain how the people of the world learn about Mark Twain's stories or why they would be so impressed by it compared with anything by any other author. I should mention that I received this book as a gift. I have not read 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'. There is at least one point in 'Eternity Road' that makes an allusion to Mark Twain's book that I could not understand.   Every time a character died (you didn't think they'd all survive, did you?), I was left with mixed emotions. Yeah! One less imbecile! On the other hand, the absurdity of how they get killed off is frustrating. For instance, one character dies in an explosion. Apparently, it's normal for methane gas to build up in random rooms even though there is no source. Only certain rooms have ventilation systems for AC and heating. It seems, in the future, there are no building codes to handle these kind of issues. There is no believability in the situation that McDevitt creates.   Compare this with Harry Harrison who writes in one series about an individual who'd just learned how to use Arabic numerals to aim a trebuchet. The character's forces miss on the first attack. The enemy artillery also misses. It's a race to see which side can reload and aim for the second attack. After some hasty computations, the good guys fire again and destroy the enemy's trebuchet. How could their aim improve so much when they can't include factors such as drag, adjustments for having a different piece of ammunition and such? Harrison explains it as 'the errors canceled out'. I've never been around a trebuchet, only seen them on TV or read about them in books. But, that sounds like a good reason to me! The credibility is high and I don't get distracted and start thinking too hard about how likely that is to happen. On the other hand, most every one should have some experience with rooms that were too cold or too hot because there was no airflow.   This continues in other ways as well. McDevitt is trying to combine the world that we know now with a future world that exists only in his imagination. To show how the world has changed, he creates new words to describe items that we would readily recognize. The way that he goes about this simply doesn't work. For instance, highways are still called highways. Cars are called hojjies. McDevitt gives no meaningful description of the hojjies, so there's no way to tell if they are like the cars of today or if they were hovercraft or used some other form of locomotion. Likewise, one character plays a 'walloon'. The only description of a walloon that we ever get is that it's a stringed instrument. What color is it? How many strings? How is it played? We can only guess. If the character instead played a banjo, an image of it would be conjured in our heads without the need for a description. This lack of attention to details is irritating.   At some point, I read 'A Talent for War', also by Jack McDevitt. From what I remember, that was a fine enough novel. I can't say that all of McDevitt's material is trash. However, I'd recommend picking up almost any other book than this one. 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 I thought that this would be a good book to help me prepare for the phase 1 testing and what else is to come.  Most of the recomendations are just common sense and all of the information was redily available on the internet for free 
 I couldn't read this book.  I skimmed it, but I couldn't read it.  It was disjointed and disappointing.  I don't think it adequately portrayed the situation.  Also, I don't mind reading religious material, but I like to know it's religious material before I buy it.  
 I had this pot for about two months, using it once a week, when one handle, then another, cracked.  The sides are too hot.  It spits out the sides of the lids.  Food burns to a crust on the sides.  I have had larger, older, Rival pots last for years.  Lately, I don't know why they just feel cheap.  I also had the bottom of the matching 5 quart size suddenly unravel while I was carrying a crock full of meatballs from the kitchen to the dining room and the crock fell to the ground with the heating element exposed.  Always used pot holders, always filled up food to over halfway.  Did all as expected, but the screws unravel or broke inside between the layers of the aluminum sides.  Can't buy replacement parts easily.  Can't reach a person at the Rival website 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 I usually try to give everything I read a break, but this book was nothing new or exciting. It had a couple of briefly funny spots, but other than that, it was kinda blah. Maybe it would've been more exciting had I not read the Nanny Diaries a couple of years ago. This book did, however, give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they're nothing more than an accessory for their parents 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 Well, it's a tribute to capitalism I suppose that here we have the 8th, and not final, CD in a series that only about 3% of those who hear it don't hate.  So, who exactly is the market for this stuff?  Is is all just parents who think they are buying one thing and end up getting something else?  With each new CD there is a new crop of moms with three-year-olds just discovering music, and somehow these moms get suckered into buying this?  Why do the used copies of this cost more than a buck?  Anyway, my wife borrowed this at the library and I woke up this morning to this cra...uh...stuff playing on my three-year-old's CD player (usually reserved for Beach Boys and Barney tunes).  It sounded different from what he usually listens to so I listened to a few songs while I was waking up over my morning coffee.  Talk about creepy!  All these angst driven songs about stuff my little guy has no concept of and hopefully some stuff he never will.  What parent would buy this CD for a child knowing what's on it?   Anyway, I reserve my right as a parent to let my child have a childhood.  He can wait until his teenage years to be a rebel and listen to music I hate, and even then I'll draw a line somewhere.  I just didn't want to deal with this stuff during the present decade.   
 The English-Speaking world has badly needed a wide-ranging history of Christianity that focuses on the lives of ordinary Christians. Unfortunately, this need still goes unmet.  The contributors to the first two volumes of this series (the only ones I've looked at so far) often have mastered an impressive amount of factual material about earliest Christianity, mined from a variety of literary and non-literary sources. Unfortunately, they interpret this mass of data through the distorting lens of a couple of highly questionable theories - theories which they accept without examination, or even question. The result is that little of what they say about the topic is reliable or useful.  The older of these unquestioned theories is the famous 'Bauer Hypothesis', developed by the German historian Walter Bauer way back in the early 19th century.  Bauer argued that originally there were a multiplicity of competing "Christianities" - no one more correct or authentic than any other - and that it wasn't until after several centuries of struggle that what we know as "orthodox Christianity" finally triumphed, and then attempted to destroy all trace of its vanquished rivals.  This theory has become almost unquestioned "orthodoxy" (forgive the pun) in most academic circles, but few scholars have bothered to make a serious examination of its assumptions to see if they fits the facts.  Some scholars have, however, and one of them is the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who wrote an essay called "Does It Make Sense to Speak of pre-Nicene Orthodoxy" as his contribution to 'The Making of Orthodoxy: Essays in Honor of Henry Chadwick'. He seriously undermines Bauer's assumptions and makes a convincing case for a profound and intentional unity in faith and practice in earliest Christianity. I recommend you check it out.  The second theory governing this series is much more recent, but no more scrutinized. This is "Foucauldianism" - developed by late 20th century French deconstructionists, particularly Michel Foucault. It was Foucault's belief that all discourse (religious, political, philosophic, whatever) has one purpose - to help one person/group to exercise power and control over another.  Applying this attitude to Christianity, for example, has obvious results.  One will look at any theological statement about the Trinity, Christ, salvation or ascetical practice and wonder, "Who is trying to control and manipulate whom by teaching this."  For most of the contributing scholars, this plays out in perceived issues of class and gender. The Church fathers, who have been revered for centuries as teachers of Christian truth, are now seen as 'The Elite' who created "discourses" to maintain their power and exercise "discipline" on the masses. The masses, for their part, may have pretended to go along, but (these historians assure us) they were always creating "subversive interpretations" of the Elite's discourses, in an effort to undermine power structures and liberate themselves. As you can tell, this sort of rhetoric gets awefully tiresome after a while.  It is obvious to me that it will be impossible to make a fair or useful evaluation of orthodox Christian faith and life when all the evidence is selected and distorted so as to fit agendas such as these. I'm still waiting for that good social history of early Christianity.      
 I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!  The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.  The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.  What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket 
 This book is sponsored by the American Council for Cultural Policy and is an excellent illustration that this organization is completely devoid of ethics. The various articles in the volume detail how the 'innocent' art and antiquities dealer and collector could and should be protected by U.S. law, all the while defaming the rights and plight of Native Americans, victims of Nazi appropriations, and countries suffering from massive art market-driven looting, to name only a few. Property laws figure heavily in these debates, but naturally the question of how stolen or looted art and antiquities become the 'property' of collectors and dealers is answered in such ways as to show the dealers and collectors as the true victims of both the thefts and the judicial systems. Although the book is claimed as a balanced discussion of the many complex issues surrounding the ownership of cultural property, it is clearly in the corner of the wealthy dealers and collectors (and their lawyers). 
 pretty raw outlook in the life of Basquiat I'm an avid fan so i have no regrets having this 
 This book could have been written by any party affiliate decrying the state of the media in favor for the other party.We all know about the use of statistics and anecdotal evidence and the authors hate-mongering against Conservatives leads little credibility to use of such devices. If you're a Democratic (or someone who writes reviews and says I'm a Conservative, but...) this book is going to help you account for the tremendous beatings you've taken in the polls and your increasing loss of popularity across the nation. If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.  In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting 
 What can I say? It's not a Radio Shack 160" boom antenna. However, this antenna would probably work better if you nail it up on your roof 
 My Tv started to have sound problems and I sent off an email to Olevia. No response. Then tried calling support - had to leave a message.  Days later after no response I called and transferred to sales - helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back - NO LUCK with call back  3 weeks go by and now I am getting rather ticked at the no response. So rewrote email again - no response.  Called tech support and left my number - no response.  Again called sales and got another person. Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.  The support issue is really bad. My recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the TV.  Oh, and Good Luck!!! 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 What a beautiful hunk of toaster. But alas, all style, no functionality. First the lever which helps lift up the bread stripped its gears (approximately 3 months into use), then the inside heating elements ceased to function (4 months into use), and finally we tossed the unit when it began to smell like burning wires.  Incredibly disappointed with T-Fal service - they do not stand behind this product.  
 Does D.S. know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended. I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.  Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.  I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire 
 I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this film, because it lost my full attention past the opening scene.  After five minutes, my significant other was asleep.  Always a bad sign, he'll watch anything.  The movie is about the last two months of Van Gogh's life, and it feels like the viewer is watching each day pass by; each scene draws out innocuous, tedious details, e.g., a scene Van Gogh examined by his physician sucks up a good ten minutes of the time; physician chats with his cook, his son, yada, yada; Van Gogh undresses; cook snaps green beans; physician walks back into the room; more small talk; silence.  There's lots of scenes of people tending to their personal hygiene, eating dinner, and making small talk.  In subtitle.  This is just an example of the pace of the entire movie, and this sucker is l-o-n-g.  It's like watching the last of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, only infinitely less interesting.  If you feel you absolutely must watch this film, plug it in your DVD player, grab a good book, your cell phone, and your laptop so you can net surf.  This film just Will. Not. End. Ever 
 I hate to say this about such an amazing show, but unless you can find it for $19.95 or less, do not buy it.  This season does not have an out-takes feature.    No comedy on TV should release a DVD without a bloopers reel.  Scrubs has always been known for the best bloopers.  It's why many of us shell out $25-$30 for the season as soon as it hits the shelves.  Interviews with the cast and crew are only valuable to the cast and crew, and deleted scenes are useful to remind the writers that you care about them.  But the audience wants to be entertained with more than what we can see on Comedy Central in a few months.  Seriously, the show is in syndication now, and the value of the actual episodes goes way south after that.  Give me more to make me laugh 
 I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER 
 I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating 
 This magazine recently (April 05) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time.  Number 1 was the sing-along scene from MAGNOLIA.  Other moments in the top 10 included the credits from AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of Eugene Levy's quotes from AMERICAN PIE.  Keep in mind, these are the 100 greatest movie moments of ALL TIME.  This mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of FHM stretched out to full-issue length.  Utter trash 
 I read all three Conversations with God books and enjoyed each of them. I think there is much of God in the words.   Unfortunately, as Walsch has continued writing, each of his books has more of Neale and less of God in them. Book one was very clearly inspired by spirit, book two was somewhat spirit inspired and book three is mostly Neale Donald Walsch's ego pretending to write inspired words. Tis a pity. Success can be challenging.  However Mr Walsch did inadvertently provide a massive amount of entertainment in the form of the Amazon reviews that Christians have written. They can all be summed up as "The Book Wars".   Basically. "My special book is the word of God and your book was written by the devil."  Jews, Mormons, Christians, Muslims, Scientologists, etc, etc, all have their special book. Each says that God wrote one book and one book only and that all the other books are blasphemous.  Silly but entertaining 
 Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!  I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book 
 Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned the mess that passes for the plot and writing; ultimately this is a parody of a hoax and so good for a laugh in places but offers little to sustain interest. By far the best part of the whole experience comes from the audiotape edition: hearing Burt Reynolds pause each time before pronouncing "Booger" with great relish is an absolute treat 
 I might have expected "nothing much" from a sister whose life had not connected much with Anna Nicole Smith.  I didn't really want a lot of autobiography of Donna Hogan and pictures of herself and her friends, but I got it.  I do hope that the government agency that oversees disability pensions reads the part about Donald Hogan 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 The first Dr. Sears book I read was "The Baby Book", which I found helpful and somewhat insightful as many other parents that are gentle in raising their children. But I became very turned off by this book and the entire Dr. Sears following that has thousands of parents looking to him as the guru of child care. This book, like all the others in the "Sears library" of books is a carbon copy of his other books and reiterates the same beliefs. He uses this book as a medium to promote his attachment parenting beliefs and uses the title "the successful child" to make parents believe that his parenting beliefs are the rule rather than the exception. Yes, I know that Dr. Sears has eight kids and is a well renowned pediatrician, but that doesn't make him the authority on parenting and child development and other issues that he has written books on including family nutrition, pregnancy, and childbirth, and to suggest so would make his books utterly self-congratulatory other than proven techniques that work across the board. I hope the parents of his patients don't feel that they have to conform to his beliefs in terms of how they choose to raise their children. It is good to take what is useful to you as a parent from various sources such as this book; but I refuse to see Dr. Sears as an authority on my child's development and on my role as a parent just because he has written dozens of books that are regurgitations of each other. As a parent, you must learn to think for yourself as well as seek out information from other sources 
 I was first angry after reading Mr. Flynn's book but now all I feel is pity for him and those that gave it a glowing review.  The thing is they just DON'T get it.  They don't get Christmas.  At it's core Christmas may be a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus.  But at its deeper core...if one actually takes the time and effort to search it out, one finds the true origins of our Christmas holiday.  The origins in the pagan Roman Winter solstice celebration of Saturnalia.  A celebration that including feasting, gift-giving, and much revelry.  In other words, a celebration on unlike the way most Americans celebrate it.  Christmas can be a quiet day of religious reflection if you want, or a season of fun...a season of enjoying Frosty and Rudolph and the Grinch on TV, of wathcing decorating shows (without a hint of relgious symbolism) on HGTV or DIY, it can be jumping in the car and drving around the neighborhood at hight looking at houses decked out in lights.  Having parties with friends you haven't seen in a long time, baking sugar cookies and Gingerbread houses.  All without the religious trappings that Mr. Flynn seems to fear.  No one expects EVERYONE to celebrate Christmas.  And so what are we to do?  Cancel Christmas because 18% of the U.S. is not ?Christian?  Heck, my Arab neighbors put up Christmas lights.  Almost every ethnic group has some kind of celebration of light and music.  Does seeing Rudolph and Santa Claus on TV really impose our religious beliefs on people?  No.  Mr. Flynn is a stinker of the highest degree...he's a party pooper.  He's one who can't live with the belief that the majority rules.  Whether you celebrate Christmas as a day...or a season that starts when the Halloween decorations come down, Christmas is the one time of the year when people seem a little nicer...when people who don't give to charity all year reach in the their pocket for a dollar and give it to the Salvation Army.  These are dark times we live in filled with war and threats..and for a few weeks out of the year Christmas helps us put aside those worries.  People who feel threatened by Christmas' commercialism or relgion just don't get it and never will.  What a shame...what a pity.. 
 I love to read autobiographies and the like, and Bunny Tales was my most recent read.  The grammatical errors were numerous, but I was able to work past them and focus on content.  The stories of the parties and sexual escapades I have read before - no surprise there.  As for Hefner, he can live anyway he chooses; don't knock it if you are going to live it. He doesn't owe these girls anything, yet St. James comes across as selfish and superficial and most of all, ungrateful.  Bless her heart; St. James is conflicted and insecure, about herself and her choices.  To me, this book is a chance for her to justify her actions and validate her existence.  I found her opinions petty and sad...and I think she caught herself while writing and, to preserve her facade, would try to redeem previous statements with the positive. As the adage goes - that which you find disturbing in another's (perceived) character defects has nothing to do with them, but is a mirror to identify your own.  I can only wish her luck and hope that this book brings some closure for her so she can move on. 
 Do not purchase this ebook!  You can't print it.  AND it uses some sort .NET internet validation that stopped working on the laptop I downloaded it on.  So, I CAN'T print it and I CAN'T read it.  For GOD'S SAKE SOMEBODY TELL ME  - WHAT GOOD IS THIS LOAD OF E-BOOK!  Unreal.  Absolutely unreal 
 Mr Bennet says nothing every other right wing looney has been sceeching for a decade! The Gays will destroy us! Divorce will ruin us! The Liberals are taking this country to H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! The Founding Fathers Mr Bennet is so fond of were Radicals, aka Liberals, not Reactionaries, aka Conservatives. Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Paine were the people who started this country,they believed in the rights of the accused, seperation of powers, division of church and state. The conservatives went back to England!! Please Mr Bennet, go back to England: The England of 1777, where your prejudices and narrow mindedness can find a happier home than here in this awful, liberal, radical, wonderful country!!! 
 I thought this was something I would use and enjoy. After just a few uses I can't be bothered with it. Most of the words I tried to looked up were not there. It may be of use to a gradeschooler, but anyone with a higher reading level would get nothing but a bookmark and I would rather use a paperclip 
 If you need a photo essay of beautiful models masturbating with dildoes, then this is your book. Some quite strange-looking dildoes too. This little tome could have been really so much better. In the introduction, the photographer notes that he only asked the models to be "insolent and indecent" in their poses. His instruction was indeed heeded. My own taste in photographic figure studies is "artistic nudes" who reflect some class, so this one goes back to Amazon. To each their own 
 Ooh this is so innovative! Cr a p py wi g g e r music that sounds like EVERY FU C KING THING OUT THERE!!! This loser is the biggest wi g g e r since Fred Durst and Eminem! I mean come on how could this get a 3.5 average?! Stuff by D4L, Chingy, and 50 Cent get low averages so why can't this?! "Ms. New Booty" has to be the most unoriginal song out there and the beat in "Heat it Up" is super annoying. This guys voice just sounds so tired and bored! This is music for stupid people and no one else. If you're smart you would listen to a band like Queensryche or Dream Theater that rocks, not this sh i t 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
 A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history.  What on earth do his personal likes and dislikes have to do with anything?  This book is written with an almost flippant, name-dropping tone that detracts from the subject matter.  After all, he is talking about Hollywood, not a subject which lacks in flashy self-promotion.  I came away from it less than impressed 
 Very disapointing book, very little in the way of in depth design research. More of a novelty item, coffee table book than a useful referance guide. Like so many design books, a great concept that does not deliver 
 Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman.  I watched this as a teenager and despite the "striptease" this has to be one of her worst.  Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time.  If you like Fonda, try Klute.  She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess.      
 This book of Bettelheim's makes me particularly mad because as a teenager I read it to see if I wanted to attend that place. And it sounded so lovely that I thought, oh this is the place for me to get better.  Too bad, Betttelheim didn't mention his use of physical abuse and shaming. Too bad, he didn't mention that the O.S. was really an abusive cult and that his successor was completely brainwashed by him. 
 She writes well but I find most of the commentary, ironically...rather infantile 
 Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls" 
 The Eastern Front was a giant massacre. The Eastern Front story is about cold-blooded Nazi Killers, commanders who sacrificed all their human instinct to the Gods of War, ordinary soldiers who became flesh-eating beasts in pursuit of conquest.  Hitler wanted the annihilation of Russian Jews, Bolsheviks, as well as the  destruction and subjugation of the whole Slavic "race" (see Germany in the Second World War, Institute for Military History; World at Arms, Gerhand Weinberg; Hitler, Ian Kershaw).  Nazi intention were not kept secret from rank and file soldiers. On the contrary, these intentions were constantly drummed into German Soldiers like Biderman (Hitler's Army, Bartov; Ordinary Men, Browning; The Wehrmacht, Wette and Lucas-Schneider)  Maybe we ought to keep Nazi war aims in mind when praising German soldier's heroism on the Eastern Front in Forgotten Soldier; Guy Sajer; Hitler moves East Paul Carrell, or Lost Victories; Von Manstein.   Biderman portrays himself as a humble, introverted, pragmatic young soldier.  He was obedient.  He saluted and he did what his superiors told him to do.  He was proud, brave, and devoted to his men, ......etc.  He didn't think about anything more complicated than his Pak gun.  He wasn't involved in  politics,  etc. Coming from German soldiers, Biderman's portrayal of himself is similar to most of the German first-person writers. He's more believable than Manstein because Biderman was not responsible for any important decisions in the 132nd division.  Its easy to view the document as sneaky self-justification.   After all, the text was supposedly written for 132nd division survivors -- men who need to validate their service to the Nazi State, who need to rehabilitate their personal character.    Awful events took place in Russia during  Biderman's  War.  Millions of Russian soldiers killed and wounded. Millions of innocent civilians killed.  Jews were murdered in the millions by Commandos and order police. Apparently Biderman did not understand any of it. Unlike Voss, writing in Black Edelweiss, Biderman refuses to engage any of these implications. According to Biderman he was the last barrier against Bolshevism in Europe.       What did Biderman really do out there in the Crimea and Leningrad? Can we believe him when he writes that he treated civilians correctly? After all, he requisitioned their houses and liberated their hidden food, burned their towns, killed their sons. Did Biderman really rescue the lost cow for the old couple?  Is it true that Biderman never had to shoot even one unruly civilian or a guerilla?  He didn't kill even one commissar?   He never saw any Germans kill captured Ivans -- even though Ivan was constantly massacring captured Germans? Was the 132nd division really the best-behaved division in the German Army? Surely Biderman kicked a prisoner, at least once.  In a larger sense, does Biderman realize that the 132nd division perpetrated one of the biggest crimes in History by tearing up Russia? No. Biderman dodges these questions in his sanitized version of Russia.  He has not admitted to his sins and he has not been forgiven. He ought to return to the Crimea and apologize to the civilians 
 My mother asked me to buy this book for her, and she has not slept since and I wish I read it first. She is upset because bird flu is a worrying possibility, yes, but also because this book writes about it in a way that is designed to make you think, o dear what if the neighbors infect me? how would i save myself, if other people were suffering? It is a bad state of mind, to think of your self when the whole community is badly sick. This book remind me of those men who go to remote deserts and dig fallout shelters and hide there with guns and canned soup. It sounds too excited about the possibility of everybody else dying and being horribly dangerous to you like a zombie film, even though it is written by doctors who should be wise and not selling to people's selfishness and fear. My mother keeps crying in the night and she needs comfort and shame on them 
 This woman put 23,000 people out of work. Poor thing, she got fired, received a huge severance and a book deal. Now all she can think about is herself and how bad they did her. I fell asleep reading it. 
 This albums sucks so bad. There is only one true reviw on the page the one that says this ablums gay is right this album is gay. G-Unit is way better then ja rule or murder inc. He needs to stop saying s**t like whats his name no one care what his name is. There is usually one song i like on ja rules albums, this time it is wonderful ft. R. Kelly & Ashnti. This song is pretty good Kelly does outstanding, not much Ashanti but he uses her too much, needs to get another r&b female (he can't). Ja Rule does a little better then usual on this song. Overall this album is 1/10 
 For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested.  I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling.  When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, "I didn't think of that one."  The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters.  The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained.  There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended.  It left me wanting to know more.... 
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.   By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it 
 VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God.  This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere.  This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book.  Stick to the earlier stuff 
 The book is about leading a company, not about the law of attraction. Although it may be a fine book for entrepreneurs, it is not a book on philosophy 
 This book is what it would be like if McDonald's wrote his biography for him. It's poorly written. Canseco glosses over many issues, where more detail would be welcome. Some parts of the book are difficult to believe. For example, his first wife to be as fiancee didn't know he played baseball for a living and assumed he was a drug dealer but still wanted to marry him. In addition, her father was one of his Little League coaches. Yet, she claims not to know he was a ball player. Please.     He's arrogant and self-serving, naming names of people who did him no harm. Example, Walt Weiss running an old lady off the road and getting away with it.     It's your basic crybaby trash. 
 This book was deplorable. It was obvious Dr. McPherson started out with some preconcieved ideas of what he wanted to prove with this book, and then he proceeded to force the data to meet his theories. In addition, the logic he used was overtly flawed. This was one of the worst Civil War books I've ever read. What a waste from a really good author 
 Though I respected Allan Bloom's translation and introduction to Rousseau's "Emile", "The Closing of the American Mind" shows his inadequacy as a social theorist as well as an academic.  The worthy, though somewhat obvious, point here is Bloom's recognition of America's movement away from intellectualism.  Ironically, this work filled with tenuous arguements makes a case that intellectuals (if one considers Bloom this) have very little to offer (and may be incapable of understanding) society. His comments on music, culture, and race are embarrassingly naive and insipid.  One of the more glaring deficiencies here was the treatment of German philosophy; I don't know that there is a notable scholar who has more misunderstood Nietzsche than Bloom.  He should stick to translating French and leave interpretation up to more worthy critics.    
 I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?! 
 Sent flowers to my father's girlfriend in Florida for her birthday.  Flowers were left on the porch to die in the hot Florida sun.  My father tried to contact them and nobody responded.  I sent an e-mail that I am still waiting to see if they are going to do the right thing by either sending new flowers or giving my credit card a refund. I learned a lesson... stick to a name brand florist 
 The book is far short of original text, not interesting enough to hold attention.  I would not recommend it 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 I'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as "listenable" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the "Club Mix" of "Turn It Around."  But if we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about "club music" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic. It's just missing on Turn it Around.  I wholeheartedly recommend Believe, but I'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used. 
 This recording is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place 
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 We know strollers!!  This is our 5th stroller over 4 kids.  We decided to try a dually.  Pros: Plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds.  "Cute"  CONS: We're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller.  In our opinion the added expense shouldn't equal just an extra seat, but better design and higher quality.  1)  While the dimensions are listed in the description, the relative size to every day objects are not discussed.  Objects, like say, doors.  This stroller won't fit through 90% of the doors in the world.  You basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on Parking it in the garage next to your suburban.  The doorway must be a 3'0 door (36  inches wide).  That's usually only your front door.    Forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller. 2)  The straps are awful.  Again, our 4th stroller.  Worse one of all.  Incredibly, incredibly difficult to use.  I'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are.  Despite having tightened them up as tight as possible, the two year old was out in under 10 minutes (once she decided to be out). 3)  Impossible to allow the children to sit up.  Again, adjusting the straps to the utmost, the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep.  Perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps? 4)  Hand brake is setup for the left hand.  Appears to be reversible if you want to work on it. 5)  Hood can not be lowered to cover front of children.  If say, you are walking into the sun (morn or evening), the kids are completely exposed.  Conclusion: Very frustrating buy.  Wouldn't recommend it at all 
 One thing this book proves is Schiller can't write his way out of a paper bag (if indeed he even wrote it at all.)  Describing itself as non-fiction presented in the form of a novel, it fails miserably on both counts. Instead it's quite transparently a quickie translation of a television script into a junk book.  And junk is no exaggeration as I found this so-called book remaindered for five bucks at an overstock store.   Check out the helpful Amazon stats on this work and you'll find the writing is at the level of a 7th grader with the absolute minimum of multi-syllable words.   The case of Robert Hannsen is absolutely fascinating, but this "book" definitely is not 
 After reading this book I came up with a better title for it: "Web sites for dummies".  But then again, should web dummies really read this book ?  The content of this book is made of a series of advices about organizing your web space. Most good advices in this book are already available (for free) on the W3 markup validator (validator.w3.org) or on some other W3 Consortium page (w3.org).  Other advices are just worthless, like this little jewel: "[...] sound effects can be used as an extra dimension in the user interface [...] the progress of a file download could be indicated by the sound of water pouring into a glass".  Surely that will clarify it all! Should a flushing sound be played as well ?  I don't see how such a sound could actually give information about the progress of a download.  People really serious about designing user interfaces should try one of Jef Raskin's books, like "The Humane Interface" (ISBN: 0201379376) which introduces quantification techniques of a user's pain when manipulating an interface 
 I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it 
 I bought this book a week after becoming engaged; I have not opened it since. It is outdated and offers no real life suggestions on how to plan a wedding. I have since created my own wedding planner. I've gotten some great planning advice and suggestions from Bride magazines and friends. I would advise anyone against purchasing this book. Maybe there are other planning books that are useful, but I wouldn't take the chance of wasting my money, again 
 This magazine is another part of the Murdoch empire.  Its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative.   It was  founded by William Kristol, John Podhoretz and Fred Barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals.  When conservativism was a living movement, it was best  characterized as a collection of independent voices who  while they respected each other didn't always agree with each other.  Now, following the Murdoch formula, its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the  payroll.  The price of being on the payroll is of course  not rocking the boat.  Reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber.  Its strange that there is so much "conservative" media today, but that most policy decisions don't get debated or even discussed among conservatives. They seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals.  And for god's sake, no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking  about how america needs more god this or god that.  If your going to be religious, at least find someone who is sincere. And no more articles on the greatness of family  by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else.     
 When my husband and I decided to start a family, we agreed that we would be happy with either gender, but we both preferred to have a girl.  I had read the book 2 years prior, and decided to read it again before we attempted to conceive.  I began charting my cycles as instructed, and even purchased expensive ovulation test kits to make sure our timing was right.  After 4 months of calculated attempts, I found out I was pregnant.  We were sure it was a girl, since we followed the instructions from the book EXACTLY.  Well my ultrasound was last week, and we discovered we're having a boy!  After seeing his little body wiggling around on the screen, we quickly realized that this baby is the love of our lives, and that the gender never really mattered.  Mother nature knows best!    
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, "WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN". I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE "CREW" WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE 
 The best way I can convey my opinion of Glen Phillips' new record is to say that I really want to hear songs from "Winter Pays for Summer" when Toad the Wet Sprocket come to town this summer.Normally it would be anathema to suggest Toad omit any of their classics but I need to hear some of these tracks performed live with Todd,Randy and Dean.The lyrics, the melody, and the instrumentation are flawless and will no doubt demand many repeat listens.It is just wonderful to take a chance on a CD and realize it is a bona fide gem 
 I used to really enjoy Mary Higgins Clark's books, but I get the feeling that the more successful she becomes, the more she's just phoning it in. This story was irritating on several levels, not the least of which was the author's trademark formulaicism that's becoming almost comical (the protagonist is beautiful and wealthy, ludicrous coincidences pile up until everyone but the reader believes she's guilty, etc.) I saw the ending coming a mile away, which you will too if you've read more than two of her books. And MHC's subtle bourgeoisie attitude is a bit offensive (when a villain is relaxing at home, you know he's a bad guy because his chair is made of "imitation leather," while the innocent main character has lovely European antiques distributed throughout her home.) Finally, MHC's characters are supposed to be young and modern-day, but not one of them speaks like today's young adults. This author's total inability to capture authentic language or everyday slang makes my suspension of disbelief even more difficult. More than one character uses the word "quarrel," more than one time each. How many native New Jerseyites in the year 2006 would ever just casually drop that word instead of "argue" or "fight"? Because of this tendency to inadvertently use language that was probably commonplace when MHC herself was young, conversations between the characters sound stilted and almost amusing.   Overall, I can't say I recommend this book even as a beach read. If you're looking for a fast, fluffy but satisfying mystery, turn to her old work first (better ones that come to mind are "A Cry in the Night" and "Let Me Call You Sweetheart.") The things "No Place Like Home" feels it can get away with are, by the end, just too ridiculous to accept 
 I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
 Suitable for making your car windows rattle.  Will flash you back to the mid 90's with funky bass breaks.  A few heart pounders that are fun if you are flying.    Not as heavy as DJ Irene or Bad Boy Bill, not even close to the mastery of Aprhodite. DJ Icey has done better with essential mixes although I'd skip his Disco Rodeo the release party was a BOMB!  
 We are "training" and really were looking for a useful aid.  It didn't work for us, allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated.  We will continue to use it with our younger child, IN HOPES of avoiding a diaper "leak through" accident. 
 The leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an SD card to stick onto it.  I have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but I decided not to chance it. I am surprised that Canon cautions against placing the camera in Strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature!  Although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse.  The neck strap is OK, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera.  The battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money 
 At this point in their career, it's very obvious that the Alan Parsons Project was trying to update their sound for the mid 1980s, digital synthesizers (DX-7, for example) and drum machines. Unfortunately they were really beginning to play it safe, in fact too safe. Most of it sounds like anonymous pop. What progressive was left over on their previous release, Ammonia Avenue (like the title track) is pretty much gone here. Even the instrumental "Hawkeye" isn't much to write home about, in my book. Of course, by this time, the band had no more hits. You don't find a single song on this album that gets regular radio airplay. It's plain to see that the album sounds quite stale and they've ran out of fresh ideas. I Robot, on the other hand, is the sound of the Alan Parsons Project with fresh ideas and much better music. They weren't playing it safe in '77 and I like that very much. So if you're a diehard fan of the APP, of course, Vulture Culture will be part of your collection, but if you thought they started losing their freshness after their first three to five albums, skip this one 
 I can't recommend watching this movie. Maybe if you like the pain and have never seen some of the older movies that now famous stars have done. It's really no that entertaining, believe me 
 My mother got me books every Christmas when I was growing up to encourage me to read more. She got me this novel 1 year because of the title (I'm the baby of our family) but I just didn't get it? The story was just odd but to each its own. 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them 
 This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 As a long time mathematics tutor and teacher I know this book very well. I don't think the material is presented or explained in a way that is especially helpful for young people. As a tutor I have to constantly reintroduce the topic and/or try to stay ahead of the student's class. Beyond that, the students are asked to do only the simplest of proofs. Additionally, a new topic will be introduced and then no problems appear in the exercise portion of the section to help the student test and practice his or her understanding of the newly introduced topic (and of course, those problems invariably will show up on the chapter exam and the final).   Moreover, I think the book just fails the kids. It seems to omit certain standard concepts by being "accessible" and undemanding of even the most minor critical thinking skills. I believe that both of these shortcomings will leave the student unprepared for the challenging problems on standardized tests and on college entrance exams. Not to mention any sort of subsequent advanced work in high school and college.  Another thing about the Larson book is that the answers to many of the problems are so arithmetically peculiar that the student has no feeling that maybe they actually got the right answer. Good problems reassure the student that they are on the right track. Also, once a new concept or definition is introduced it is never repeated.  Overall, I think that the more capable students will be shortchanged and misled into thinking that they know more than they actually do and the less capable student might pass geometry but will perform poorly on college entrance exams and be unable to successfully progress in mathematics if they need to do so.  
 I was really excited to receive this book... however, I've had a difficult time enjoying reading it.  The run-on sentences, poor grammer, and loose sentence structure are so distracting, that as a reader, you loose interest.  I spent more time editing in my mind, then pulling together what the author was saying.  Rather long-winded, I kept having the feeling of "let's get to the point."  On a positive note, there are some fun pictures and the author does string together some interesting concepts.  Personally, I just couldn't get past the writing.  Summary - although interesting, don't expect concise writing 
 The first part of the book is unbearably slow,  the gender differences of boys and girls are painstakingly boiled down into a litany of "boys excel at..., girls excel at.  The list that everybody has heard, sports and spatial tasks = boys,   penmanship, language skills = girls.   The saving grace of this book is that in the 2nd part the author mentions what should actually be done.   Michael Gurian, author/ educator, also has a few pilot projects being run in the state of Missouri. The results sound encouraging.  He encourages teachers to start catering to the needs of both genders in the class. He stresses that to do this teachers will need training.  As for parents the usual "be a concerned and supportive parent" is always added.  I was generally unimpressed with the book, no real blockbusters. The real world results of his pilot education programs were to me the issue that maybe the author was onto something. Hopefully if it is as good as its portrayed this method will gain some notoriety. 
 I've owned and used this machine for over a year.  Sometimes the coffee is really good but sometimes it comes out really weak.  If you don't set the carafe in just right, the pause-and-serve feature stops the coffee from flowing into the carafe and it overflows the filter instead.  The result is coffee all over the counter, floor, etc.  It has ruined my wood floor!!!  I am always careful when I put the carafe in, but it happened anyway.  Last night I brewed a pot of coffee and it came out tasting terrible.  I'm done with this coffee maker, buying a new one today..maybe the braun 
 an avid reader, writer, and traveller, i believe religiously in the value of a good guide book. if i were to judge all travel guides based on my experience with Frommers Cuba i would be an atheist. Every major point proved to be the complete contrary. my guess is that the previous revue was written by someone from frommers. honestly, this book did not ruin my vacation, but if i had not realized from the beginning how wrong the information was, it would have completely destroyed my time in cuba 
 I have read all of the books up until this one, and this one is definitely the worst so far.  In fact, it makes me wonder whether I will continue to read the series.  The book is misnamed.  The Ionian mission is only the last fourth of the book.  The first three-fourths is a very boring description of two battles that came close to happening but never did.  The Ionian mission itself is fairly confusing with all of the personal names and place names bandied about.  Jack Aubrey, as in most of the other books, is burdened with an extremely difficult mission.  He must decide who to support in some kind of three-way civil war.  He makes the wrong choice, but then is called away to fight another party who has seized some British vessels.  Talk about deus ex machina!  There is nothing of much interest that happens in this book.  Stephen Maturin doesn't really do anything interesting in the espionage line, and Professor Graham is a bore.  The final battle scene is as predictable as most of the others--Jack Aubrey wins against all odds because he is a good captain.  I recommend skipping this one if you are reading through the series.  I would bet that Patrick O'Brian did not spend very much time writing this.  In fact, it seemed like bits and pieces patched together to form a "novel. 
 I love Postal Service. So i picked this cd up after reading all of the great reviews. DULL. sorry folks. there is maybe 2 or 3 decent "songs"...but the rest of the cd is just 5 minutes of a syth "warming-up" here and there. oh well 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 This guy thinks collectors want to see his own creations of what rare prototypes are. What a complete waste of time. Collectors want to see the real thing. Most of the "rare" prototypes in this book are fakes that Santelmo forgets to tell the reader. This book would be useful if you are interested in conterfeit items 
 Despite buying four copies of 'Call to Action' for my development team, reading it through twice and making copious notes - I can't recommend that you read it.  It's not that it's bad - it's just not that good and I have to believe there are better books out there.  'Call to Action' describes itself as 'both a step-by-step, how-to manual and a treatise on the true nature of conversion'.  In my opinion, it fails to deliver on either count.  There's no doubt the authors know what they're talking about but, ironically, in a book dedicated to the process of communication, they fail to communicate either a cohesive overview or a detailed 'how-to' of the subject.  There's a facade of structure and some whizzy acronyms like 'AIDAS' and 'MAP' but very little flesh is laid on those sketchy bones.  The introduction identifies the main cause of the problem - the book started life as a collection of disparate web articles interspersed by 'top-tips' from marketers 'in the trenches'.  The articles themselves give the sense of having been shoe-horned into a structure simply for the sake of it.  The 'top-tips', more often than not, are completely irrelevant to the theme of the article they're paired with.  As a reader looking for greater understanding of the subject and some concrete next-steps, this discordant content yields as much confusion as clarity.  On top of this, the numerous typos, misquotes, repeated quotes and printing errors confirm that insufficient care has been taken in the preparation of this book.  It hasn't even been professionally proof-read, let alone purposefully written.  So how come I purchased four copies?  The first half of the book does contain some exciting ideas such as developing content based on the persona of the visitor and planning precise conversion scenarios from the home page to the conversion point for each type of visitor.  The second half of the book is mostly padding and pointless repetition of the ideas in the first half.  I purchased the other copies of the book after reading the first half and expecting the second half to follow in a similar vein.  All things taken into consideration, the book reads like a series of adverts for the authors' consulting services rather than as a 'how-to' or a treatise on the subject.  Other authors quoted in this book are:  Roy H. Williams, Jared Spool, Tamara Adlin and Jim Sterne, and I'll be checking out their writings in my continued search for genuine 'how-to' content.  The Eisenbergs could have made this book more effective and much simpler.  They chose not to write for their audience and, to my mind, that makes them guilty of the same sin they condemn online marketers of - focusing on themselves instead of on their customers.  The Eisenbergs make the point that content created for offline advertising rarely translates directly to the web.  This book is proof that the reverse is also true 
 Aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in Same old song and Dance, Seasons of wither, and Janies got a gun. Rest of the songs just stink explosively. Avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band, steven tyler screams, he can't sing at all??? this is music for drug addicts 
 I love Bruce Campbell's work; even have the whole Brisco County, Jr. set, but this movie was a big disappointment . .  
 In the opening chapter, Dr. Lovett introduces the major theme of his book; "This book has been written that you might gain an understanding of the manifestation and presence of the powerful Holy Spirit.  This will be accomplished through the study of an obscure and seemingly insignificant implement known as a rod."     Dr. Lovett interprets the Old Testament motif of "the rod" to be an archetype of the Holy Spirit of God.   Dr. Lovett's position concerning the present day work of the Holy Spirit is that it is misunderstood by modern believers and that this misunderstanding stems primarily form a misunderstanding of the rod motif of scripture.  In his opening chapter Dr. Lovett goes to assert that it is because of a lack of understanding of the very real present work of the Holy Spirit that has led to the rise of liberalism in mainstream Christianity.  He admonishes the reader to embrace the presence and work of the Holy Spirit in their lives and churches. As is the case throughout this book, Dr. Lovett's style in this chapter is heavily sermonic, giving little supporting documentation or evidence for his claims.  In one instance Dr. Lovett goes on a rather didactic rant concerning an unstated position taken by some unstated churches early in the annals of church history which led to the unspecified effects of the indeterminate doctrine "known as liberalism."     The author goes on, in the same protracted paragraph, to write, "These churches have degenerated into mere social clubs and religious organizations that are empty and void of any spiritual blessings from God."     Who are the churches of whom the author speaks in such negative terms?  What evidence does he propose to support his claim that they are "devoid of any spiritual blessings from God?"    Chapter 2: In the second chapter, Dr. Lovett begins to lay the theological groundwork of his "doctrine of the rod."  He points out that the rod is mentioned over 250 times in the Holy Scriptures.  He informs the reader of the early text which has been translated as "rod" in English.  The Hebrew word mettah has been translated from the Old Testament as rod, staff, shaft, or branch.  The Greek word rhabdos can be translated as staff or staves.  The same Greek word is used for rod and signifies a piece of tree limb used as a support or a weapon.  Dr. Lovett gives this information to lay the foundation for his further declarations concerning the relationship with the biblical rod motif and the Holy Spirit.  He tells of the story found in Genesis chapter 38 when the patriarch Judah gave his staff to his daughter-in-law Tamar as a sign of his promise to return.  She was to keep the staff, along with some other valuable articles, as a sign that he would return to her with a lamb from the flock.    Dr. Lovett then writes, "Likewise, we Christians have a promise form the Lord that he will return just as He promised," drawing a parallel between this story and the promise of Christ found in Ephesians 1:13-14.  "In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest (guarantee) of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."   Dr. Lovett places particular emphasis on the similarity he perceives between the staff of Judah as a sign of his promise to his daughter-in-law Tamar and the Holy Spirit's role is the process of sanctification when He secures the believer's eternal inheritance.     As is the case with the other examples that the author uses to support his claim that there is a close relationship between the rod motif of the Old Testament and the revealed Holy Spirit of the New, the connection between Old Testament passages and New Testament passages is strained to fit into the mold of the author's thesis.  The connections are not obvious and for the most part they are strained.  Chapter 3: In the third chapter, the author puts forth a rather encouraging homily concerning the role of the Holy Spirit as the believer travels the journey upon which God has called them to.  He presents a litany of scriptural references with rather limited connection between them.  This chapter is likely to be encouraging to many, but as is the case with the whole book, it is little more than the author's personal opinions and random thoughts on this thing or that.  The author seldom even comes close to addressing the supposed thesis of his book.  	 In this chapter the author does give several interesting and intriguing illustrations in regard to the power of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.  Neither these stories or anything else in the passage give much indication as to the relationship between the rod motif and the power of the Holy Spirit for the journey of faith that believers find themselves traveling.  While perhaps encouraging in some sense, the chapter provides limited insight into the supposed central theme of the book.  Chapter 4: In this chapter the author discusses the results, as he sees them, of being filled with the Holy Spirit.  He speaks of this filling as a command which believers have the ability to fulfill.  Again, the author cites and quotes numerous scripture passages and then connects them with pithy statements, clichés and generalizations about unnamed segments of the church.     The author makes ambiguous statements which are difficult to sort out.  "The goal of our lives is to walk continuously with the Rod of the Spirit (Holy Spirit), which literally means that we are walking with Jesus Himself."     Statements like this are found throughout this chapter, and the rest of the book, in ways that often seem out of context for the theme or message of the book segment in which they are found.  Chapter 5: The author opens this chapter with the assertion that there is a great spiritual truth to be found in the fact that all of the great men of God in the Bible walked with a staff.  The author returns, briefly, to defending his opening thesis that the staff or rod passages in the Bible all speak to a rod motif which points to the Holy Spirit.  Since the great men of the Old Testament and the disciples and apostles of the New Testament walked with a rod then that is metaphorical for believers walking with the Holy Spirit, the author's rod of the spirit. 	 It is in this chapter where the author presents the connection between the staff in the Bible and a bed.  He points out that the Hebrew word translated bed into English is the same word which is translated staff or rod.  The difference of meaning is indicated to Hebrew readers by its usage in its original context.  Dr. Lovett then draws a connection between the Holy Spirit and a bed.  He does support this idea biblically by citing passages in New Testament book of Hebrews which refer to spiritual rest.    Chapter 6: In the six chapter the author quotes passages of scripture and shares stories and anecdotes which point the way that the Holy Spirit works in the heart and life of the believer to bring about victory through the all too common adversity of this life.   Dr. Lovett recounts a touching story of God's very real presence and comfort from his own life when he and his wife had a stillborn baby.    Chapter 7: In the seventh chapter the author asserts that God does not always choose the most capable people to accomplish his tasks.  Indeed, it is quite the opposite.  God routinely chooses the people who are seemingly the least qualified and well trained to accomplish bring his purposes to fruition.  In the Bible there are numerous accounts of God using the unlikely to accomplish the impossible. 	 The author does an effective job of relating this biblical message through many quotes passages of scripture and the use of a relevant poem.  The chapter might be encouraging to those who doubt God's ability to use them and it could be a valuable resource for those believers who need encouragement in that area.   Chapter 8: In this chapter, curiously out of context with the chapter title, the author speaks of the need for believers to recognize the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.  The author does spend some time deviating from paragraph long rants about his displeasure concerning the current state of the church in this area or that to tell a story in keeping with the thesis of the chapter.   	 Dr. Lovett tells the story of a man who had left a job a respiratory therapist to attend Liberty University for ministry training.  Upon graduation the man spent several years in various forms of Christian Ministry only to find discouragement and discontent.  Eventually the man realizes that he has been operating out of his calling.  Upon returning to his former career and utilizing his gifts in his local church, the man is deeply satisfied; having found the solution to when the rod does not seem to work.    Clearly, the goal of the author is to encourage believers to be empowered by the very real and present power available to them in the Holy Spirit.  In the forward the author writes, "My goal in this book is to communicate the dynamic Spirit-filled life that should characterize every Christian."       The author does provide the reader with numerous scripture citations.  The citations of biblical passages alone could be rather valuable for personal study or in preparation of group study on the subjects discussed.  Dr. Lovett is direct in his writing.  The reader is left knowing what the author believes concerning the things he writes about, though not always about the message of the book.  While proof-texting is a habit highly regarded in Religious writing, Dr. Lovett takes proof-texting to an extreme.  His constant citing of scriptures references actually detracts from the message of this book.  If one were to remove all of the direct scriptural quotations from the book, it would likely reduce the size of the book by two-thirds!  The Bible is a valuable resource which should be treasured but with the author's excessive scripture citations, there is little room left for his thesis to be expounded. 	 The author routinely diverts from his central thesis to record rants and tirades about various ecclesiastical ills - as he so perceives them to be.  The book seems to be little more than a platform for the author to preach against this thing or that.  As a reader I was left wondering what the overall point really was.  Was the focus the things holding the church back from experiencing the Holy Spirit or was it to know the presence of the Holy Spirit personally?   Many of the author's points were not well connected to previous paragraphs and statements.  It read like a collection of pithy statements and short devotional homilies.  The author makes tremendous indictments about perceived problems in the practical Pneumatology of daily reflection in the lives of believers and then does nothing to support those statements.  The book reads like a sermon spoken with no notes or preparation.  It meanders without making a central theme apparent.    The topic of the presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of believer has received great interest in recent years.  It seems that believers are interested in knowing more about the biblical doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the practical ways that he is available to them.  As with most recent books on this topic, Rod of the Spirit is ambiguous - it's subject matter being slippery and hard to grasp. 	 The way the Holy Spirit works in the lives of individual believers is difficult to describe since it is, by nature, largely personal and experiential.  Doctrinal works which describe the more rigid biblical doctrines of the Holy Spirit's ontology and character are more precise by their very nature.  Christian living books, such as Rod of the Spirit, have the difficult of making the unreal real and the very personal experiences of individuals accessible in ideological terms to the masses.  In the opinion of the reviewer, the contents of the book are better suited for a sermon or journal article than for a book of this nature.  The connection between the rod motif of scripture and the Holy Spirit is not well supported in the text, though a homiletic connection may be drawn.     The pithy commentary nature of the writing is distracting and the author has filled the pages with so much direct quotation from Scripture that he left little room to develop a thesis.  The book is likely to have value for devotional purposes.   The author's passion and love for God is clearly evident in the pages of this book.  I value and respect the ministry of the author though I have taken a fairly critical position in regard to the contents of this book.     
 The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's "trained" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 Very much a disappointment! Especially for those of you who were deticated fans to the Talking Heads throughout the late 70's and 80's. The first three tracks were okay, I guess or better yey I should say TOLERABLE. Tracks 4 through 10 on the other hand ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Like fingernails on a black board and it's sad because those of you who could dance to classic hits such as "burning down the house" that listened to this album know there's nothing you can dance to, or really even upbeat for that matter. It was an unfortunately exhausted effort by who even by 1988 was a worn out band. Why do you think later by the following year maybe 1990 they broke up 
 YAMAHA(it's a japanese company) makes many products, for example, ICs, pianos, keyboards, audio products.  The YAMAHA's best audio product is NS-1000M, a book-shelf speaker.  NS-1000M is the best speaker made in Japan in the history.  Unfortunately, NS-1000M is not sold now.  And more unfortunately, YAMAHA now has become a trivial maker.  NS-333 is only one of low cost speakers. or 
 Masturbatory crap that belongs in Penthouse Forum.  Young bachelor's bathroom reading.  Go buy something from Anais Nin or Henry Miller and skip this garbage 
 I bought this book because amazon recommended it and I was very disappointed.  It's a series of unconnected interviews with crass self-promoting real estate brokers, with a few boring socialites I've never heard of thrown in, for spice I think, but they're really just bland.  Speaking of bland, who cares about Tommy Hilfiger and why start the book with him?  I knew most of the supposedly hot celebrity tid-bits already--they're all recycled from old gossip columns. For $26.95 (okay, even for $18 plus shipping on amazon), I expect more than a 250-page clip-job.  Page Six is free on the web!  But worse, there's no story, no narrative to speak of, no characters you can care about.  It feels as if Gaines was rushing this out, or cashing in on his last, equally disjointed but somewhat more amusing book on the Hamptons, or just phoning it in. What a waste of paper not to mention my time and money!  
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 I teach a computing ethics course at an area University.  I did not select this book as my text when I reviewed texts for use in the Fall 2004 semester.  I did choose Spinello and Tavani's new reader; but this book--like most of the predecessors Spinello has written--would drive my students nuts -- and they wouldn't know why. Bottom line: poorly written and not easy to read -- lots of tough sentence choices made.  However, as with Spinello's other books, there are some points he makes that no other computing ethics texts' authors do make!  So, I'll glean those points out of his text and present them to my students rather than force them to work their way through and around his prose 
 Don't waste your time on this drivel.  This writer has unjustly thrived over the years consistently raking up false malicious muck on the Fabs. True Beatles scholars know Giuliano for what he is - he was despised by George Harrison and I'm sure Paul feels the same way.  
 Making this unprincipled betrayal of core American values all the more stinging is, by his own confession, his respectably working-class roots, where he grew up next to a gas station in a small New Jersey town. His modestly humble, unpretentious parents even admitted to the room-for-improvement in their lives when they moved to a bigger house from Randolph Street to Institute Street. Springsteen's parents understood the essence of Americanism in its promise of social mobility no matter your background--yet Springsteen spits on this sanctity like Kerry the Defeatist by equating ALL actions of America with tarnishes of "global hegemony", "colonialism", "might makes right", or whatever other socialist-menacing psychosis this unsatisfactory-educated "Boss" invents. Springsteen's been glaringly seduced by the entertainment community's leftist dictatorship and its mentally depraved, conspiring enforcement of herd-mentality that America's the "problem". 
 The key to getting out of poverty, is NOT to get into poverty to begin with. Examples include having children, but not having the financial stability to raise them. As well as the irresponsible usage of credit cards, which can amount to serious debt, getting married/divorced, taking out a second mortage on your home, after you have already paid your home off. etc, etc, etc,    Adam J.

 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 After having bought the first edition and read numerous other Finance & Strategy texts (in addition to having graduated with an MBA in Finance), I think it's fair to say this Grinblatt book is rather superficial in its coverage of technical matters e.g. options, financial engineering etc. and poor in its treatment of real life contemporary issues e.g. M & A, bankruptcy etc. Plus I still can't see what it has got to do with Corporate Strategy. Something is still missing here....  Most of the write-up are kind of basic (i.e nothing oustanding) explanation of issues, concepts or techniques in Finance, which you can easily find in other texts with much simpler names. The title of this book is catchy but MISLEADING. Priced at $120, this is really a rip-off. I just don't understand how other commentors could give a 5-star for this "shoddy" piece of work. Reference manual for corporate boardrooms and Wall Street? Come on! You guys must be joking! No offence but is this what they'd call "cutting edge"?   Compared to classics like Copeland's "Financial Theory & Corporate Policy" or slightly less-advanced Brigham's "Intermediate Financial Management", this Grinblatt book really falls short of the standard and needs a lot of catching up to do. Hopefully, the authors will take serious note of this in their upcoming edition. Unless of course, they still want their book to be just another "appetizer" for business undergraduates....  In short, NOT worth buying. And NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER or in this case its rather appealing TITLE 
 Before making a decision on whether or not to purchase this book, I feel I should share some important information about its author, one Mark Kram, so that you can make an informed decision on whether this is the kind of honest man who is going to write a fair and even handed account on anything regarding boxing:  In 1976 Don King arranged the infamous US Championships Tournament for ABC television. This was a tournament involving fighters signed with Don King or his cohorts only. Bribery was used to corrupt ratings to justify the inclusion of undeserving King fighters/exclusion or far more deserving non-King fighters. The more worthwhile fighters who wanted to participate were told they would have to kickback a chunk of their purses to King, whilst also leaving their current manager and signing with King. Those who refused this blackmail were left excluded. And thus a bogus tournament was created with a clutch of retired preliminary fighters and obscure journeymen, dressed up as contenders with fake records and paid for rankings.  Where was Mark Kram in all of this? This `journalist' accepted gifts and gratuities from Don King and penned a puff piece article promoting the tournament for the January 1977 Sports Illustrated. Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, this `journalist' was bought and wrote a four page article extolling the virtues of this "great tournament" and "the honesty of Don King"! Of course the tournament fell apart half way through and its massive corruption was exposed, as well as Kram's. This `journalist' took money under the table to humiliate the most respected sports publication in the US. No surprises the magazine fired Kram and had to write a full expose/apology by Robert Boyle in the May 1977 Sports Illustrated, atoning for Kram's article of lies.   And now all these years Kram resurfaces from under his rock, attempting to destroy the character of Muhammad Ali. Perhaps a look in the mirror may have been more appropriate. Muhammad Ali is loved by millions worldwide, and accorded major respected by fighters, both amateur and professional. Mark Kram however, is an exposed crook and isn't even accorded respect by fellow journalists, let alone fighters. Maybe if Kram had ever had the guts to lace on a pair of gloves he would have more of an understanding of just how hard it is to do what Muhammad Ali does

 I would suggest that you rent this before buying it!  Unlike the reviews above it was one of the worst thing I have ever seen.  I walked out of the theatre on this and there were many people on the lobby that walked out before me!  This is not a film for everyone and requires a very special taste!  There was no story...that I could see just a bunch of clips that made no sense 
 I liked this novel at the beginning.  The cast of characters was good.  As comic relief I thought Hannah Goldsmith was great -- and, speaking euphemistically, the tension about progress, or lack thereof, in her love life was of considerable interest.    What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.        Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books. I hope so.  But don't choose this one to read unless you are really, really a fan.      Smallchief    
 I LOVE Elizabeth Berg.  While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing.  I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life.  I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that.  I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said "Wow - she is SO right!"  I also don't like books from a child's point of view.  I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.  If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her.  She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel 
 the first half of the book is hype about what will happen in the second half.  something along the lines of: "i dont know why sensei acted why he did, something bad  mustve happened in his life, he was an annoying jerk, so i hope something really bad happened to him that can justify his being such a jerk who is annoying."  does the second half justify the first?  hardly.  sensei remains a jerk, and even goes beyond that by refusing to change, and even beyond that by transforming his pupil into a jerk.  what a bunch of jerks.  about the only person who is not a jerk in the book is the wife, who both the narrator and sensei view as just a stupid woman, you know, those types of humans who dont know how to think or really serve any purpose except to worship sensei.  man that guy is irritating! and the narrator too!    spoiler   the stupid kid leaves his dying dad so he can see the dead sensei!  what a jerk!  his dad is so much nicer to him!  the stupid sensei treats his wife like crap and never tells her why!  then he kills himself so she can be depressed, without telling her why!  what a jerk!  and he tells the kid but not her!  and he forbids the kid to tell her!  what a jerk!  
 I have read many books on fighting in the European theater in WWII. I have also heard first hand accounts from my uncles who fought in Europe including one who was a tank driver under Gen. Patton. I must say I found Roscoe Blunt's book hard to believe. He states he received special training to defuse landmines and bombs. But after being in combat for serveral months he never was called upon to use his special training. At one point during the Battle of the Bulge he mentions he leaves his foxhole alone, at night to reconoiter thru a minefield toward German lines then becomes disoriented and lost. If that is an example of how a "battle tested" soldier acts then it's amazing he lived to tell the tale.  I have to believe most of what is written in this book is highly embellished to say the least 
 This text comes highly recommended as a classic by far too many creative writing and screenwriting teachers.   Want to know if this book is for you? Read this passage:  "In the second, by means of a contraction analogous to that which abbreviates a syllogism to an enthymeme, this undecided power is but an attribute of the persecutor himself."  The entire book reads this way, so if that works for ya, you'll love this book. If it doesn't, you'll need to look elsewhere 
 The first time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 5 stars.However, this book is the least accurate of all the Lucy book I have read, and I have read a lot.  While I was reading it, I noticed that some of the things Mr. Brochu said about Lucy directly contradicted with her autobiography. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I went to Luie Arnaz's website. She distinctly said that this book was not accurate at all and to skip it.Then everything started to fall into place. This is as much of a cartoon of Lucy's life as anything. Yes, it's touching, but what good is touching if it's not true? Everytime I think about the fact that Mr. Brochu so plainly lied, it infuriates me to tears. If you want to know the REAL Lucy, skip this book. Go staright to her own touching, candid memoirs, "Love, Lucy.&quot 
 Beware...this is NOT a book which will help you change your life.  This is a story about a man who's life changed drastically for the better.  Oh, would you like to know HOW?....well, cough up an extra $189 dollars and the secrets will be revealed to you.  This is not an interesting autobiography either, thinking he was leading to something big and reveavling later on in the book, I forgave him for all the disonnected prattle in the first half.  It dawned on me as I got three-quarters through the book that nothing was going to be taught to me, not now, not unless I paid extra to order the course. I don't know how this helped all the other readers who gave this 5 stars.  I am assuming that they bought the course, otherwise believe me, there is NO WAY your life will change by merely reading this book.  I felt cheated. But what a great marketing technique: you get people to buy a book which then gets them to buy a more expensive course! They have to, otherwise they are left hanging on a string. I definitely wouldn't have bought this book if I had known it was about someone merely telling us his life has changed.  I hear that so often from the countless recently-converted fanatics who knock on my door armed with all sorts of religious paraphernalia.  Having said that, I am sorely tempted to buy the course in order to satisfy my curiosity.  I feel like a lover, enticed and aroused, who upon approaching the zentih of passion is dumped aside with a "Not today, maybe next time, darling" excuse.  Aaaah...but today would have been so nice for me and not unless I buy the course I will never know what secret pleasures await me and neither will you.   
 Like "Where's Waldo", it seems every issue must have at least one, if not several Mies van der Rohe daybeds.  While this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture, one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients, "You have to have one of these, they're what's IN!"  Most of the features in Metropolitan Home suffer from the same fate; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible, uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck.  "Modern" equals, of course, a Mies van der Rohe daybed (notice how many times it shows up in this review?), otherwise you get month after month of 1970's florals, faux Louis the Whatever tables.  Even using feature extraction, wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes, it's painful to look through this magazine.  If you really want ideas for making your house reflect you, trust yourself and what YOU like, and if you do like Mies van der Rohe daybeds, by all means get one.  Just don't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it's trendy. If you like the Modern style, look up the works of Hans Wegner and Peter Hvidt and go from there; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well.  Maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy.  For everyone else, think about the things you'd like to see if you walked into a room, save your money and skip this magazine 
 The previous model, the 101 was an excellent pair of headphones that would only set you back about ten dollars.  Sony replaced the 101 with the 110.  The 110 has the same good quality sound as the previous model, but it is smaller.  Even standing still, the headphones slip off of my ears causing me to constantly adjust them.  I don't know if it is the smaller size or angle of the headset, but the fact that it won't stay on my head makes it totally worthless.  I have many other kinds of headphones and have never run into this problem before, so it is a faulty design, not the shape of my head.  I would stay away from this model 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 Have to agree with earlier post, book looks nice and clear but numerous errors make actually using (vs. just browsing) the material very difficult.  7th edition ADI section has numerous mislabed equations, incorrect data values, unfortunate.  Suggest look elsewhere for a numerical analysis book 
 Jay P. Greene has an agenda: the end of public education. Individuals pay him to promote this agenda, those individuals operate at the Manhattan Institute. The Manhattan Institute does not believe in participatory democracy; it believes in rule by elites. In order to undermine democracy, the Manhattan Institute must undermine public education. It undermines public education by lying to the public via "scholars" like Greene.  Unlike real scholars, Greene's work is not peer reviewed, and his "studies" are in fact "working papers" which allows him to circumvent peer review. A real journal, like Nature, would never publish a single piece by Greene.  Allow me to respond to a few of the "myths" forwarded by Greene and co. If you still want to read the book, borrow it from your library, or write me and you can have mine!  Myth 1) "Other countries score better than America on tests."  Fine, let's select one of those countries, how about Belgium...What is Belgium's poverty rate...4% (the CIA provides detailed economic information for most countries)...If America lowered it's poverty rate by 8.7%, do you think test scores would go up? I do. Why? What would be different about our cities?  2) "Test scores have remained stagnant for years..." LIE. When disagregated by race, every subgroup (including upper class whites) have seen their test scores improve...why? Since the early 70s, more and more minorities, immigrants, and disabled children have entered our public schools, and for a variety of reasons, they tend to score lower on most tests. As more, lower scoring groups have entered they drag the higher scores down so the overall score looks stagnant, when in fact, everyone has been making small gains. It's called Simpson's Paradox, and most individuals who have taken stats in a PhD program know about it. Also, and importantly, some people have to fail tests, otherwise they are meaningless...We can't all be above average; this seems so obvious it pains me to have to point it out. Furthermore, if American schools could kick out the lower performing students at age 15 (like most European countries do), do you think our high school students would look better? Yes, but there's that troublesome 14th ammendment to deal with...If American students spent 6-7 days a week in school memorizing math and science facts like Korean children do, would their scores go up? A little, but if scores had any corelation to economic success (which they don't, see the World Economic Forum) wouldn't Korea/Singapore be wiping the planet with us?  3) "Spending has doubled with no increase in performance." Not really, see #2, but also consider this, American public schools accomodate all students, including students with disabilities, who can cost upwards of 50,000 per student, per year, to educate. Furthermore, thanks to individuals like Jay P. Greene, America spent 8 BILLION more on testing in 2004 than it did in 1994, despite the fact that most scholars have been screaming that testing does not raise scores. It's like weighing a cow more often to fatten it up. Finally, thanks to the tireless efforts of lobbyists, American schools have spent BILLIONS since 1996 on technology that has never been linked to improved test scores. An idiot on a computer, is still an idiot.  4) "Charter schools outperform public schools." Really? There is no conclusive evidence that charter schools outperform public schools, and according to the most recent NAEP report, charter students performed lower (though not significantly lower) than their peers in math... And charter schools can turn disabled students away. BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THE WEAK!  What happens when charters close? In California, 2004, one company went under and displaced 60,000 students. Roughly 10,000 of the students wound up in charter schools run by another company that would fold two months later! The presidents/CEOs of those companies made a great deal of money, who lost more than money?  6) "Americans should put their faith in corporate America to save their children." Yikes. Did you know that Wal-Mart stands to become the largest power in educational philanthropy/reform? Do you think Wal-Mart will treat America's children better than it treats America's workers? Are you willing to take a chance?  If our schools are so horrible, and 89% of Americans have gone to those schools for the past 50 years, why is America so great? Why do 2,000 illegal immigrants risk their lives everyday to enter this country? Why do an additional 800,000 a year come here legally? To punish their children?  There is nothing objective about this book; it is part of a larger plan to undermine participatory democracy, which neocons don't believe in. They attack the schools because, GASP, they have done their job...Think there would be a black Secretary of State if blacks had been kept from decent education?  NO.  
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence.  This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades.  One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts.  That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the "Descent of Man," not "Origin of the Species" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.  Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development.  It's the worse case of reductionism in history.  James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book.  They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton.  They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological.  How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific?  Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment.  Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.   First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75:  "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."  There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book.  Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection.  Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye.  See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, "Hume, Newton and the Design Argument."  Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.  But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake?  First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks.  Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded.  Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it.  A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this.  I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards.  Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book "Statistical Mechanics."  Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's "Descent of Man" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 Why do I keep comin' back to these movies?  After "3" (or after Lionsgate got a hold of the series)I shoulda known that there was no hope for another descent film to come outta this series.  "Rave From The Grave" combines(tries to anyway) 2 of my favorite things in life.  Zombies & the underground DJ culture.  Let me just say, they fail miserably at both.  They filmed this movie back to back with part 4, & anyone who saw part 4 should know thats not a good thing.  I'd say this one sucked worse than 3 & 4 combined.  The plot is some "raver" kids get ahold of the trioxin & some how get high off it in small doses.  They go and find their chemist buddy (stay with me, it get's better) & put the trioxin into a pill form to distribute all over there college campus.  They call the pill "Z" because "you get so high & tripped out, you're like"... wait for it...  "a zombie".  Are the script writers in Hollywood all just completely retarded now, was that really the best that they could come up with?  Mean while there are these 2 "secret service" or "Interpole" guys with some of the thickest Italian accents I've ever heard are running around trying to find the missing drums.  You wind up waiting over an hour before anything really even happens.  The script, director, whatever, I don't know who's more to blame for this abomination, but how did this even get made?  The acting is HORRIBLE, you wanna see the lame azz characters(especialy the DJ guy, that loser needs a good punch in the face)killed in a grizzly horrible manner.  The make up & special effects are okay, but still nothing like they used to be in the 1st 2 films.  It's movies like this that give the Rave culture such a bad name.  It's very obvious they know nothing about the dance scene or Zombie movies.  It's a shame, they've efficiantly (I hope anyway)put the last nail in the coffin for this once great horror series.  It's a shame & there's really no excuse for this kind of sloppy movie making with such a beloved(well, not so much anymore, but it used to be)property.  Lionsgate knows good horror movies, that's apararant by watching titles like "House of 1,000 Corpses", "The Descent", "Undead", "Saw", "Cube", & "Devils Rejects".  Why they would do what they did to these last 2 movies... well like I said, there's just no excuse.  Thanks again Lionsgate for ruining another property I truely used to care about.  Avoid this movie like a cracked drum of trioxin, it really is that bad 
 What a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Is there some way we can send the dumbasses at Brady publishing to Iraq. The one star rating is generous as the only person that likes this manual is my 1 yr old 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
 Ju Dou is a great movie, I'd only previously seen it on VHS borrowed from the public library and was so looking forward to this release, but sadly I concure, this DVD is as bad as the other reviewers have previously stated.  Worse than the old VHS recording I saw 7 years ago.  So bad, that it's gotten someone like me, one who never writes reviews, to comment on it.  This DVD should not be sold in the United States, or anywhere.  Unfortunately, I picked this DVD up on a whim before reading any reviews.  I'd suggest you just cherish your memories of this wonderful film until a better transfer is made available.  It was good to be reminded of the story, but very sad to see how carelessly Razor Digital Entertainment handled this transfer.  It really baffles me how terrible this transfer is.  A few moments here and there the picture actually looks acceptable, but then the rest of the time it's blurry, washed out, monochromatic yellows and browns, lines and dust marks everywhere, and occasional digital glitches.  This dvd has probably any bad transfer cliche you can imagine; more than I've seen anyway.  Yimou Zhang is a great director, Li Gong a wonderful actress, and it was from two beautiful films(seen only on VHS :( ) that I discovered this, Red Sorgum and Ju Dou.  But heed the reviews, this DVD lo-fi remix of Ju Dou by Razor Digital Entertainment is a nightmare 
 I purchased this book because of the time it takes to assemble a shopping list for both "The Perricone Promise" and "The Perricone Weight Loss Diet". I thought this would do it for it. It lists a "basic guideline for foods", but it is not comprehensive of all the items needed to make the recipes on the two week diet. I'm still painstakingly going through the recipes to assemble my shopping list 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 It's amazing to me how people can have such different opinions of a movie. The 5 star ratings are BEYOND ME but to each his own!!! This movie was absolutely horrible. I rented it out of curiousity thinking it might be a good horror flick. Oh My!!!!!!! I could not wait for this movie to be over with. Stupid beyond imagination! A killer snowman who melts and reappears where ever he wants to? There was some blood in this movie but that doesn't make this a horror movie by no means and doesn't make this movie any better. The stupidest part is this Jack Frost the snowman making snowball babies who try to kill people following in their "father's" path. This is more of a dark comedy than anything else but even as a dark comedy, this still remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen!! Don't waste your money!!! 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 Oh boy. I wish I didn't have to finish every book. It is just a pet peeve of mine. However, I couldn't get into this book. I see no clear theme. I know everyone was horrified at 9/11, however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse. What happens to all the characters? One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over 
 Lethargic but prescient novel about dull, spoiled American leisure class brats in trouble: a blueprint for the Reagan Irrevolution & the Bush-Clinton wastrels & wastrelettes 
 Don't waste your money on this book, unless you want to go back to older versions of Linux... Many of the links are gone, many of the programs don't work with the newer versions of Linux (post 2004), and buying this book in September 2005 was basically flushing nearly $50 down the toilet.. 
 I was surprised to find that within the first 100 pages interspersed among some very practical advice about the focus of your life and your approach to living was complete nonsense about astral projecting, aura perception, dream walking and other new age babble..... However, I pressed on, thinking "fine, I will just ignore this new age magic twaddle and look for the good points".... much to my disappointment, it continued throughout the book.  I'm not sure if Dyer as always believed in this claptrap or if he has just recently gone off the deep end, but either way, it's sad 
 I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying "But McBride's Books Say". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 Purely on the merit of hearing one of their fab early singles on the radio, I took a risk and bought this album hoping for more of the same. Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it 
 This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version.  Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take."  While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.  Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half.  In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable.  All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
 This is a book written by women - for women - almost all of the examples and people profiled are women - they even go so far as to quote a writer page 235 co-auther Jennifer) as saying, "Sometimes it bores me - why I am pigeonholed into looking at things from a woman's point of view all the time?" One gets the feeling that this collaboration was done by a few ladies sipping espresso for the purposes of marketing themselves and hoping to garnish more freelance work in the process. Some of the chapters are useful - if you are a woman and want to write about women's issues - but the areas where they deal with non-women-focused interviews, quotes and advice seem as they were thrown in as an after-thought - somewhat as if the manuscript was finished and the editors commented that they needed SOMETHING for SOMEBODY who isn't a feminist 
 While I would thoroughly endorse and support Susan Clancy's belief that alien abduction is not a real phenomenom, she fails to give the subject the scientific attention one would expect from a psychologist. Her research is shoddy, amounting to soliciting abduction stories from crazies that answer newspaper personal ads. No interviews or research from psychologists treating people with abduction delusions was given, and she failed to identify the psychological causes for such phenomenom that other authors and peer-reviewed journals have covered, ignoring any psychological cause other than psychosis or sleep paralysis. A much better guide to the topic is "Abductions and Aliens: What's Really Going On? " a book written by a psycholgist who has done a literature survey, and has actual case histories to evaluate. Abduction delusions are real, and they need real treatment. Clancy offers no such coverage of treatment options, or any real psychological or scientific research. She took her phd candidate thesis and tried to make a book out of it. I don't think we'll see a "Doctor Clancy" writing again any time soon 
 I had to read this over the summer for school, and I really hated this book. Part of the reason is that I couldn't relate to Selina, and the book was overly descriptive. I'll also agree with the person who said "What ending?" This book might be interesting if you're Caribbean or even African American. For a white Jewish girl living in the suburbs, it's not. 
 End broke off in the lighter within a few hours use. Still waiting for a refund via Kensington. Pass on this one.  It's JUNK. 
 Some years ago, a brazilian lend this book to me.It's a small and concise book.In fact the only quality of this bad book is his small size. All the rest are ridiculous Castro's propaganda. Well, I'm an (unemployed) brazilian agronomist.I must tell you that Cuba has nothing to teach about agriculture.In fact Castro's Cuba is, a complete agriculture failure.The big Cuba's crop is sugar.Well, in 1912, Cuba produced more sugar then in 2003,2004 and 2005. Cuba's experimente with organic agriculture was and is a failure.In fact, in Cuba, the general people has no flowing water, eletricity,etc. Outside privileges and money support to latin american marxists, Cuba's money goes to propaganda.And this is pure castrist propaganda. 
 This woman is brave! Brave for continuing doing something she can't clearly do. SING. In here, she tries to reach the audience she left so far behind, the latin audience. I give her credit for her efforts, or who ever was behind this. If you want to buy a good product from a real singer who has never left his people in the dust, buy Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez's 10th husband. He can really SING and has real talent.Jennifer, dear, go home, cook or clean, stay all day looking in the mirror or something 
 This is very misleading. this item is only half of the package. after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work. very disappointed in amazon for allowing this 
 I have been a fan of Patti Austin for years now but what (...) is this? It stinks big time. It's nothing but forgettable elevator R&B Jazz that I really dislike. Another shock is the use of poor language in Playing Around. How could such an amazing diva sink to such a (...)state? I,m not necessarily turning my back in her this time but I am very dissapointed with this album. Hey, at least I have a coaster to use now. This one's worth passing up. Better luck next time Patti and make it more memorable please 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 This is a critique of federal case by scholars and attorneys NOT scientists. They come at the case from a religious viewpoint whether they all admit it or not.  James Watson who along with Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in  1958, for their DNA  work. And Watson graduated from the University of Chicago at 19 and nabbed his doctorate at 22, whereas the authors of this book have NO PhD's. Watson also noted on a recent Charlie Rose Show on PBS that he only knew of one true scientist,  Francis Collins, who believed in a God. Yet on CSPAN during the week end of August 26-27 the authors of this book say they know 600.  Whom does one believe?  A Nobel Laureate with a PhD and respect within the scientific community, or authors who have neither?  The authors also make a big point of saying they disagreed with the parents/complantants in the federal case, because the authors didn't see ID as a religious belief and that ID doesn't require a belief in a religious 'God'.  But they fail in my opinion, by not realizing that it was indeed the intent by the Judge and many others, that the filers of the case did believe that ID was a God issue and that they wanted this taught. The Judge even noted this in his decision, which cannot be overlooked.  Had the authors or their Discovery Institute (discovery dot org) filed the case they probably would have found the Judge more open at least to their arguments.  Should you read the book?  Yes, simply because I believe in being informed about what all sides of an issue believe or push.  Do I think the Judge made the right decision? Yes, based on what the complainants put forth in their case.   
 It simply didn't work for me.If you are beginner, you need more than this little book.The Screenwriter bible by David Trottier is the ONE.Do not expect to write any good stories in 21 days.Stop dreaming and start writing.This book is kind of hard to read so if it's for beginner, it is just done to to make your learning more difficult than anything else. Forget it and follow my advice above 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 I picked up this book at a used bookstore on a whim and was completely disappointed.  There were one or two interesting pieces of information, but for the most part the book was repetitive and uninformative.  I agree that this book is only useful as a rulebook and extremely basic strategy.  You could get that same information from a general card game anthology, like hoyles or scarnes if you wanted to. Or, if you are really interested in learning how to win at poker there are a variety of other, more detailed books available 
 Starting off with the premise that this book is a review of the lives of the 200 children born of Nobel prize winning sperm donors is completely misleading to the reader.  It has been a long time since I actually felt lied to in the preamble to purchasing a book.  Readers should know that no children are born of Nobel prize winners, no examination of the lives of 200 sperm donors from the bank is undertaken and no scientific information on genetics are even discussed throughout the whole book.  In fact, even the data collection of the few lives the author does research seems adhoc at best. What this book is about is a look at some kids who find their true fathers through the help of the author, but more so through a Canadian director researching the same topic for a movie documentary.  The author seems to ride on the coattails of this director in finding out a lot of his information.  All the while he makes enormously ridiculous comments and judgments about the supposed Nobel prize winning sperm bank and genetics.  He never once looks at the topic with an open mind, that maybe, just maybe extremely bright parents might be more likely to have extremely bright children. He does some good research in unraveling the Nobel sperm bank and the people behind it.  But it seems he relies on old interviews and tv show spots from the 70s and 80s, a time when these topics of genetics and race and IQ were strictly taboo.   The book feels to me that it was trying to use the hype around a Nobel prize winning sperm bank to create a marketing buzz when infact this book is nothing but a review of what could be any sperm bank and any children born of it.  Quite disappointing. 
 The 1 star is for Stewart Finlay-McClennan returning as Dr. MacNeill.  As one reviewer mentioned, Kellie Martin played Christy effortlessly.  While Lauren Lee Smith tries her best, the performance is a bit...bland.  Some lines seemed a bit forced & having seen the CBS series, it was difficult not to be dissappointed--knowing what 'could have been.'  But it is worth the watch just for the story's sake 
 I must take issue with one of the claims made by the author about this book. He says that it is the only book you will ever need on the subject.  This is patently not true.  Don't get me wrong, there is some stuff worth reading in this book, but it is _suggestive_, not _definitive_. For example, his Clairvoyance and Clairaudience exercises are interesting. Also, the descriptions of the fifty spirits is useful - assuming that they are taken from his own magical diary.  But elsewhere, Konstantinos makes a bit of a hash with his presentation of the Golden Dawn-style of magic, no more obvious than in his treatment of Enochian magic, which is woeful. This is a complex subject in itself, so much so that authors like Aleister Crowley and more recently John Michael Greer have recognised that it can't be handled adequately in a book which is only general in its terms.  My advice: read it if you want - or better still borrow it from a lending library if you want! - but there _are_ other books on the subject which should be read to get a more balanced view. (See, e.g. Crowley, Greer, Lon Milo Duquette, Poke Runyon, etc).  
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 "A skepticism towards all meta-narratives" according to... Jacques Derrida, I think...  This is about all the elaboration that is done on the subject of what post-modernism IS.  With regards to what a meta-narrative is, it apparently refers to a fully general philosophical theory, concerning (e.g.) all knowledge-claims; all justificatory strategies; all moral values, rights, and obligations; all instances of injustice;      Apparently this 'theory' differs from nihilism, but if that is what defines it, I don't see how.             If you actually want to learn about post-modernism, this is not a book I could recommend; internet resources have been much more useful.  The section on modern art history and the crisis of expression was interesting, as well as some other random factoids that apparently relate to post-modernism.  On the whole though, I'd say this is a work totally devoid of substance, and and as I learn more I'm inclined to assign the same description to post-modernism itself.  For a similar, comical, and much more scathing review, see the one below entitled "Trash" by 'a reader' 
 Must clear up and correct the comments made by the "reader" (author,I wonder?) below.  Africa did obtain enlightenment on Christianity relatively early after its conception ( Christ's death, if you wish to be technical). But this was due to the fact that ( Non - African) missionaries spread the word thru the corridors of the Roman Empire's conquered lands.  The first missionaries were, of course, Jewish. Soon after followed the Europeans. Christanity in Africa did not take off until the Western Europeans started a robust program to convert the pagan population of black Africa. And, that is the way it remains EVEN TO THIS DAY!  That is why it astounds me when someone makes obvious , and probably malicious, statements as "reader" did below. Instead of recognizing, and THANKING, Western Europeans for caring enough to bring the Gospel to them, they try to hijack credit , and then issue devilish insults to boot!  I suggest that the person who posted the comments below ( "reader") please re-read your history books and learn the truth of Western Europe's gift of bringing the Gospel to sub-Saharan Africa. Then apologize for your malicious and ill-conceived statements below - it's the right (Christian!) thing to do!  Thanks for reading, and God Bless 
 Coupland's JPod is no exception to that rule. Although never blatantly publicized as a `sequel', it is hypothetically purported to be Coupland's new millennia answer to his early 1990s geek epic, Microserfs.    My comparison, Microserfs vs. JPod, in short? Microserfs, in my opinion, was Coupland's zenith of writing aptitude -- fresh and original with `real' characters that many a geek could relate to. The microserfs made you want to care about what happened to them. The story actually went somewhere.   JPod? Stale as 3-week-old bread, artificial as Twin Equal `sugar' packets, featuring two-dimensional unbelievable characters. Gone are the refreshingly all-too-human disillusioned "microserfs" with their witty repertoires and flat foods. They are replaced with JPod'ers -- dusky, gutter-mouthed and aimless, with their couldn't-care-less-about-anything attitudes. The result? We could care less about them. Coupled with an implausible, over-the-top, and insipid plot, it is a novel that evokes apathy and indfference. Coupland's frequent referrals (blatant plugs) to his other works of fiction were uncomfortable and tawdry.   Not that there weren't any redeeming qualities in the book. The reader is treated to a few remaining bits of Microserfs-esque laurels -- the memoir-like narrative, the fun cubicle surveys ("if you were to sell yourself as an item on eBay...") and splash pages with binary, spam, and technical what-not. However, it was not enough to compensate for JPod's weak plot and characters, which ultimately made the novel uninteresting and difficult to finish. As much as I wanted to like it, I didn't. At all.   It was mentioned by a friend and fellow Microserf-aficionado that it's "harder for authors to write like disenchanted young people when they have been rich and famous for 20 years."    I agree 101% and couldn't put it better myself.  
 I bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6-10 times over the course of 13 months, it stopped working.  I called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it can't be repaired & I should just throw it away!  I had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless!  Buy one at you own risk 
 For some strange reason, I began receiving this magazine in the mail. Never ordered. Never paid for. My conclusion based on reading the last three issues: You're kidding me. How can Time Inc. still publish this rag? What's the point 
 It isn't a bad book, I just feel like I wasted my time reading it.  Mieville did a great job creating a strange, interesting world that I was curious to learn more about.  He fully developed a number of great characters--there could have been three or four well realized protagonists in this book.    At 623 pages, reading Perdido Street Station was a significant investment.  It was interesting enough to hold my attention, but I feel like the author made a deal with that he didn't follow through on: "You let me spend 300 pages fleshing out my world and characters, and once you've let me introduce them completely, I will give pay you back with a great story."  I never got paid back.    I read the last 75 pages becoming frustrated and feeling like I was cheated.  I understood the characters but did not care what they did.  The main story-thread was resolved and I never felt conflict, drama or resolution.  The book didn't teach me or make me feel anything.  It was a well-imagined, dull book that had enough novelty to keep me reading until the end.  Not recommended 
 Hate buying a product that advertises as Director's Cut ...so as to expect more ...only to see less on it than what was broadcast on cable tv (that I can still remember having seen probably at least 10 years earlier during, if not shortly after, my college days). I believe the DVD box or advertised trailers for the movie even shows some of the original broadcast footage that was not in this DVD. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect to see "Shakesperean" quality acting/dialog in this. I was expecting your basic campy cheesy somewhat mindless B-movie with let's say some "eye candy" ...so as to get away from your everyday real-world concerns. But worse, the actual cutting of the scenes was SO BADLY edited that you think the Director had just barely graduated from some overseas mail-order/night course film school. Finally its just sad that they couldn't even give us the broadcast version of the movie and have labeled it as the Directors Cut ...it should be labeled CENSORS CUT 
 Waller, why are you writing this stuff?  You're an elderly gent, retired I assume, who made a bundle off the sugary-sweet and sappy BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.  Take the big money you made  and run brother--quit demonstrating your literary nincompoopismo! 
 We bought all three sizes of collapsible Rubbermaid containers from Amazon.  Right off the bat I noticed that the lids were not engineered to fit the containers without the application of undue force.  Some would not seal at all. Trying to store left over pasta was an exercise in futility as the container tends to collapse upon sealing even when it is filled with food. My wife wants to through them out in the trash.  I plan to call Rubbermaid on their toll-free line to register a complaint. So much for trusting a brand name without doing enough research first 
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem.  They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it.  It's a waste of money.  The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml.  In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on.  It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma.  I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing.  Save your money.  
 Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 Warning, before reading this book make sure you are well schooled in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, US involvement with Somalia, the Persian Gulf War, and Islam. The more you know about these subjects the more you will realize that Bergen interjects his political opinions throughout the book with side comments; by selectively adding some facts and leaving out others; and by the clever arrangements of facts.  Bergen is biased against the US and eerily; the net affect is some sort of weird admiration for OBL.  Bergen falls for some of OBL's twisted, misrepresentation of the Koran. See page 99 and note the Bergen's equalization of the words infidel and idolater. He also defends OBL's rants against the US by clarifying for the reader that UN sanctions killed 500,000 Iraqi children. Of course Bergen leaves out Saddam Hussein's role in starving his own people.  Bergen's account of the murder of Abdullah Azzam (Bergen calls him OBL's mentor) follows right after discussion with former Pakistani Prime Minister so this arrangement implies that somehow they are connected. Other scholars suspect OBL of murdering Azzam. This Bergen ignores.  In his discussion of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan he spends all his time talking from the side of the rebels. He gives no background as to events leading up to it, nor the poor military practices in the Soviet army which contributed to its own defeat. The Soviet Union published an after action review, The Bear Went Over the Mountain, that points out individual combat leaders and mistakes they made that were grievous enough so that any band of rebels could have beaten them. Bergen only presents OBL view that he brought down a super power. He does mention the US made Stinger missile, but spends more time talking about how clumsy the US was to let some of these go unaccounted for; rather than mentioning that without the Stinger the Soviets would not have pulled out.  In Chapter 4, he mentions Desert Storm and out of left field adds the fact the Timothy McVeigh was one of the 500,000 US troops there. He adds that before 9-11 OK City was the worst terrorist activity in US. The subliminal message is US Army is an equivalent terrorist organization as Al-Qaeda. Later he outright says training in an Al-Qaeda camp is better that basic training in the Army.   In discussing Somalia, he makes sure the reader is aware George H Bush got US involved. He leaves out background information about the UN and Boutris Boutris Ghali role in tribal conflict. He claims at "least 500" Somalis died when more respected accounts put the number at 3000. He says US "tried" to capture and never mention they did capture two bad guys. In all he makes the US look foolish and A-Qaeda's cause of serious blow against US. He doesn't mention the decision by Les Aspin to hamper the mission by denying the US its own armor-protected vehicles.   While recounting OBL's case against the US (like the reader is suppose to take this seriously) he adds his opinion that for two thousand years Christians don't follow the teachings of Jesus.  I'm not half way through the book and I'm sorry I bought it.   I was hoping for a documented history about OBL. Instead I got the CNN view of the world - OBL is a deeply religious man, a great military leader, a successful businessman, and has a legitimate case against the US, which by default is guilty. 
 I bought this on Amazons recomendation & can't stand it. I wanted neuvo Flaminco & this sounnds like Moog synthecizer elevator music I like the earlier work of this Atrist, the neuvo Flaminco.. & of course once you open the package its too  late to return it... so I'm stuck with their recomendation 
 I have I library full of Ragnar Benson, this is unquestionably his worst. The book is very short, and only barely touches on a range of subjects. It reads like the table of contents of a much better book! Don't discount  Ragnar though, he has a lot of great books out, this just isn't one of  them 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  I bought it expecting it to talk about how to make cordials, instead it teaches how to mix alcohol and syrup.  To me, cordial making starts with a raw ingredient (fresh fruit, nuts, herbs, and/or flowers) and then continues from there.  If you are interested in learning how to begin making cordials or in gaining new ideas or techniques, look elsewhere.  The reason it is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because there is a little bit of useful information on making extracts, but that informaiton is definitely not worth the price of the book 
 Wow--what a downer.  We watched three unlikeable characters spiral downward into an abyss of hopelessness and despair for over two hours, and it wasn't worth it in the end.  There's no redemption here, no hope of change, no learning on the part of any character.  I'd say more, but there really isn't much more to tell.  I'd never consider watching this film again, and I would recommend it to no one 
 We purchased this two years ago for the same price and have felt ripped off ever since.  I can't believe it is still on the market.  It does not do what an almost $80 piece of equipment should do.  It barely improves the reception.  Keep shopping for a better quality antenna.  There is no "Pin-Dot Pre-Tuning" with this hunk of junk 
 But only because of the disgusting, horrifying arrogance put forth in this text. It would seem to me, based on extensive quotes I have read, and the reviews of others, to be basically a design for the Fourth Reich. The Americans are establishing world domination abroad, now we have the war that in the Orwellian tradition is endless, the "War on Terrorism." Which is a complete joke!!!!! When do you declare victory??? The end of "terrorism????" At what point do you go "Yep - got em' all!" The answer is...NEVER!!!!  I would never advocate banning a book. The idea of suppressing any type of speech is repulsive to me. This should be read, by those who want to know what's REALLY going on, as so many reviewers have stated. But I would say if any government out there wants to seek out THE most offensive rhetoric written in the last 15 years or so, going after someone writing about snuff films, or rape, or gang violence, or even kiddie porn, or whatever other despicable act of human nature one could conceive of...which has been done for years by government...should realize THIS despictability outweighs them all, and go after this.  But no one should go after any book. I still say it should be published. Freedom of speech is sacred to me. But it seems to me someone advocating the slavery of the human race to a plutocracy of people who rule over the entire world is far, far, FAR more offensive than...some perv who wants to talk about sex with kids. Both are despicable, but only one seems to get notice, seems to get calls for banning, when it's published.  Which is part of the game I suppose. Distract the unwashed masses from the true genocide and hell that is going on. 
 Robinson needs a new technical editor.  He has SEALs stumbling around in the dark without night vision devices, A-4 Skyhawks with 2 engines, a SEAL team that turns into a SAS team after 40 pages, SEALs carrying the tripod for a M60 on a long mission, a long time SEAL with no parachute experience, and a poorly thought out campaign by the British to retake the Falkland islands (apparently the British do not have any stand off weapons such as cruise missles).  I gave up on Robinson while reading Scimitar because he had Iranians speaking Arab to each other.  As most people know, Iranians speak Farsi because Iranians are not Arabs, they are Persians - the original Aryans.  I gave this book a try because the jacket made it interesting but I will not be reading any more of his work 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 This short book is about the small Tuck family (a man, his wife, two young-adult sons, and their horse) , who inadvertently drink from a magic spring which renders them immortal.  Thereafter, they do not age, and seem immune to death by violence or accident.  In this state, they seem to live a happy, almost idyllic existence.  Nonetheless, they bemoan their fate as a sort of curse, which has removed them from the cycle of life.  Mrs. Tuck especially seems convinced that it would be a disaster if anyone else were to find out about the magic spring.  The exception to this sighing and moaning is the youngest son, who, perhaps because he has the good fortune to be stuck at 17, seems reasonably satisfied with his fate.  The main events of the story take place 84 years later, when a series of improbable coincidences involving the Tucks, an 11-year old girl, and a mysterious stranger, together with some idiotic behavior by all concerned, converge to force events to an contrived climax.  The author hints that these improbable convergences have some deep mystical significance.  Since this mysticism remains obscure, one is inclined to instead suspect lazy plotting.  The stupidity, and moral depravity, of the Tucks is evident in the fact that, for the last 84 years, they have done virtually nothing to conceal, guard, protect or destroy the magic spring.  And yet when (by pure luck) they learn that the spring is about to be discovered, they are willing to commit kidnapping and even murder to keep the secret from getting out.   The author strives to make the murder victim as unlikable as possible so that the killer (the Tuck mom) will retain our sympathies.  But the bottom line is that the sole motive for the murder is that the victim knew too much and could not be counted upon to keep a secret.  I cannot possibly agree that Mrs. Tuck had any right, therefore, to take his life.  The fact that the victim gloats about his less-than-noble intentions immediately before she shoots him, does not make her act any more morally palatable.  The stream, after all, does not belong to the Tucks.  What right have they to play God, and take lives to prevent others from sharing their high and lonely (if idyllic) destiny?  Setting aside moral questions, the stupidity of the Tucks is nothing compared to the stupidity of the villain.  Why on Earth did he not drink from the stream and render himself immortal?  Why on Earth did he not do this before going all by himself to a secluded location to have a gloating, taunting confrontation with four fully-grown immortals.  He is fully aware that the Tucks are determined to keep their secret, he knows exactly why, and he knows they are desperate or depraved enough to commit the kidnapping of a child for this purpose.  In fact, why does he confront them at all?  They were completely unnecessary to his plans, as he himself points out when, predictably, the Tucks refuse to agree to them.  Bottom line is, he went merely because the author wanted to give Mrs. Tuck an opportunity to shoot him, and he gloated and taunted only so the reader might say "Ha, serves you right", when sweet Mrs. Tuck blows his head off with a shotgun.  One of the ironies of this story is that, although the Tucks are convinced that the widespread availability of the magic water would be a disaster, we are nonetheless supposed to despise the villain for his selfishness, when he reveals his plan to disseminate the water only to those well-paying persons he considers most deserving.   And yet when Jesse, the youngest immortal, starts plotting to do something similar, we are expected to retain our sympathies for him.  I suppose this is because Jesse is a hot-looking 17-year old, is motivated (one supposes) by romance rather than cash, and his offer is, in effect, being made to the young female who is the target audience of this book.    I have no need to say how this latter plot thread resolves itself.  In the end, the moral of the story is ambiguous.  There is a lot of preaching about the curse of immortality, and the virtue of remaining a part of the life cycle, but what we are actually shown is beautiful people living an apparently idyllic existence in harmony with nature.  Is the moral of the story that we should not seek Earthly immortality, or that, if we should find it, we should keep it for ourselves?    This was a quick, easy, relaxing read.  It could have been much worse, but, on the theme of immortality, you will also find plenty better (Potter books, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, just to name a few) 
 Today, it came out that Felt was Deep Throat.  Seems this guy's sleuthing ability isn't that good... 
 This book is totally out of date for 2003 and 2004 
 The book starts off with a terrific survival tale of an English ship full of Australian bound captives, suddenly discovering that they are way off course due to a terrible storm. What follows is a 70 page tale of death, despair, deceit, and survival.   After that, the book is ruined by the prototypical Dirk Pitt saga. There's some monstrous, megalomaniac with some diabolical scheme. However, the nauseating Dirk Pitt comes to the rescue (surprise, surprise), and saves the day using ludicrous and ridiculous tactics.   And of course, there's tons of boring filler. Large chunks of it are filled with people having their tongue in Pitt's ear, praising his every move.   Don't bother, if you've read a Dirk Pitt novel before. Nothing new here, besides the prelude. 
 Though it is a cute book, not nearly enough information about the designer. Marc Jacobs has been around for many years and this book does not cover most of his work and I was very disappointed. 
 Despite all the bad reviews I read for various Monster Cable products, I bought one of these cables.  What a mistake.  The RCA plug flanges kept working loose shortly after purchase.  The first time I tried to gently squeeze them back together, one broke, only to reveal the cheap metal used in the connector.  Now it's loose all the time.  So I'm replacing it with a Belkin AV20500-15 cable, available right here at Amazon for about 1/4 the price of Monster.  Thankfully I chose other brands for all my other home theater cables (digital coax, optical, speaker) .  Avoid all Monster Cables.  All overpriced, all mediocre quality.  Do your research, you'll see I'm not alone.  
 As a Lenny Bruce fan, I know why someone should see it.  Owning it, however, is a somewhat empty gesture.  Most of the action consists of random b.s. film clips playing while a Bruce voice over plays.  Like seeing random movie cowboys talk to a horse or a guy on a beach while listening to "Religions, Inc."?  Then go for it.  When the footage is of Bruce, it's worth seeing.  It's too bad that sequences featuring Bruce are few, far between, and oftentimes too brief.  I would rather have an unedited tape of whatever Lenny footage one could scrounge up, laid on a VHS tape than to own this.  I own it, though, and am glad I do.  It's the best that can be done.  There are some bits on here that I haven't heard elsewhere, and it is nice to see Lenny Bruce in action.  It's just too bad there aren't quality products on the market that can accomplish this.  I wish they would make a Lenny Bruce best of tape that is somewhat sensical.  This thing is more like a lame head-shop film 
 I actually saw the advert for this work on Sean Hannity's home page - "The Turth about Hillary" (sic). The spelling probably tells you all you need to know about Mr H and the book. If you seriously wish to learn about real politics, the issues or US political system, this book will not be of use. If you believe that Elvis is still alive, then it is possible you may think it a worthwhile read.  It does however show the appalling state to which US politics has fallen. Most debate is at playground level and this book shows that in clear detail. Free speech is a privilege, not a right, and I will defend Mr Klein's privilege; but that does not mean that I think he is accurate or that I agree with him. I would ask if he would allow me the same courtesy? He certainly would not allow it of Mrs C 
 Dreck conjured from the dimwitted semi-erotic fantasies of a chinless anemic Englishman resting on laurels from 20 years past. Borderline child porn with delusions of grandeur and pretensions of meaningfulness 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 My wife is of Italian descent, which I expect was the main reason she bought this DVD. As you doubtless already gathered, it's set in Italy - mostly Rome - less than 10 years after World War II. The movie focuses on three American secretaries, two of whom work for a U.S. government agency, so it's seen from a decidedly American point of view. Which is to say the Italians are portrayed largely as simple jolly buffoons all of whom - except for a prince and his snooty mother - are socially inferior to the Americans in their midst. It's loaded with 1950s American sexual morality and attitudes, which seem horribly dated 50 years on. But mostly, I got the feeling that the director couldn't decide whether he was making a drama or a Cinemascope travelogue of Rome and Venice. The ending is hackneyed in the extreme and leaves you with as many questions as answers. I saw this in my hometown theater when I was 9. I didn't get it then and now, even with nearly 60 years of living in my database, I still don't get it. I think it's because there's nothing here to get. It's just fluff 
 After just one week of use and installing the newest firmware, this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot. By week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes. This now seems typical of previous experiences I have had with other Netgear products.  So much for plug and play.  My recommmendation: leave Netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and DHCP serving 
 This was Heinlein's 1st novel; it wasn't published during his lifetime.  He wrote it prior to WWII.  It's emphasis is on his depression-era socio-political views, not on science fiction entertainment.  Thus, the plot is thin & the characters, though likable, aren't deeply drawn.  To his credit, he changed many of his views later--as many were rather naive &, perhaps, influenced by his frustration.  Some of his libertarian social innovations, however, were courageous & innovative, but would require considerable cultural development to become politically practical in the US.  But many (IMHO boring) pages are devoted to his economic/financial system, particularly the "card game" attacking free enterprise.  It is very naive--ignores intellectual capital, population expansion, & the money multiplier (the average dollar's spent 6x/year).  His "social credit/dividend" system is utopian to an extreme & p. 243: "We don't need social service workers where poverty is unknown" is absurd--$ won't buy a child's mental/emotional health anymore than happiness.  Heinlein fans (he's my favorite SF novelist) may find it historically/developmentally enlightening, but as fiction, it's his worst novel 
 I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier. This bag was ok to start and fit my britax (a feat in itself) BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE. I would not buy it. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back 
 A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.  I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.  
 I always liked this LP, because it included some un-released studio and soundtrack recordings that had never been released before this LP first appeared in 1970. However, there have been a few slight changes in the CD version, which were kind of dissapointing. The song "Mama", which is an out-take from Elvis' movie "Girls! Girls! Girls!, is not the 2:12 mono version from the original LP...it is the 58 second, stereo version that was first included on the "Double Features" series. This shorter version was probably included because of the better sound quality and the fact that it is in stereo, although the actual reason is not quite clear. The shorter version is actually the original, the way Elvis actually recorded it. The longer version is spliced from Elvis' version and the Amigios version, which was probably done at the same session. This is the version that was used in the film, and Elvis probably liked it enough to record a version of his own...probably as a tribute to his mother. It is also possible that it was originally intended for the film, but never used. The other change here is with the song "Let's Forget About The Stars". The version included on the CD is the same take as the one on the original LP...however, the LP version included a piano track that is missing from the CD. Again, the CD includes the stereo version that was included on the "Double Features" series, probably because the original LP included the song in mono. It's possible that the master, which included the over-dubbed piano track, has been lost. Still, this CD is not a complete dissapointment, because the versions of these two songs included here are still very good. My only complaint would be that this version of "Mama" is much too short, and this LP only included 9 songs and had a short running time to begin with. These original Camden albums on CD are selling for only about 5.99, so at least they are not over priced, which makes them well worth purchasing. Still, anyone who has waited for this CD to get the versions of these two songs as they were released on the LP will be a bit dissapointed 
 Interested in this book?  Don't be, let me sum it up, use some wood as a target, walk back ten paces, and throw the knife until it sticks.  Once it does, keep on practicing.  That really is it!  A total waste of money 
 This is true even of the 1936 version...This book simply couldint keep my attention! I had to force myself to finish it, or else I'd have felt I had wasted the [money} paid to get it! Only get it to complete youre collection of Applewoods...Don't put youreself through this "adventure".. 
 I fell to one of the perils of buying a book online. This book is not organized by exam, rather by tasks. The chapters have material for all three exams. They provide a matrix at the back of the book telling you what to read for each exam.   I am undecided if I will keep this book or ask for an RMA. The authors explain the book can be used as a reference in addition to test prep. I am an IT Professional with over five years experience. I have a shelf of reference books, I was looking for a test prep book.  I have to say I am not impressed by this book, and if I had been able to find it at the bookstore to look at it before buying, I would not have picked it up 
 Don't even think about it 
 This book was given to my son as a text book and I had to correct the grammar and incomplete sentences before I could let him read it.  The title shoud be "Copy Kyla".  The page that starts "Got me some . . ." should read "I have . . ."  The pages are not numbered.  Only two pages are free of grammatical errors.  I gave one star for good illustrations and one star for the positive family life and small town atmosphere of the book 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
  I bought this book expecting something fresh and entertaining; instead, it read like a very roughly edited diary of an unimaginative naive American: "We met at XX Station at XX am. We ate XX and went to XX Shrine. We went to bed at XX pm." If this kind of rubbish can be published, then I'll offer my diaries from my last ten years in Japan to anyone who wants to make a book of them! I sure hope the author's writing skills have progressed somewhat since she wrote this. And someone should've checked the references to Japanese words before publishing this book - there are too many mistakes to count. Karin Muller's Japanland was a much better read. And if you want to know how to survive in Japan if you're "young and female", buy the Being A Broad survival book for foreign women in Japan instead 
 What were they thinking?  Pearl Harbor is nothing more than an attempt to remake Titanic with Japanese Zeroes instead of an iceberg.  While not quite "Postman" bad, Pearl Harbor's awful acting, terrible dialog, and overall uninspired dross toward a delicate historical event marks this film as one for the bargain bin next to "Showgirls. 
 This movie stinks! How can anybody promote this crap of a business. The same people whose jobs are being lost and whose small towns are being abandoned because of Wal-Mart are also voting republican and watching Fox News. All this because of fear, gays, guns and the bible. A documentary should be made about ethical businesses like Cost-Co, In-N-Out Burger, American Apparrel and Patagonia...these companies pay good wages and our socially conscious. Cost-Co was in fact criticized by Fox News for not being more "considerate" about their shareholders...that says it all about Fox and the GOP. Yes! I believe Capitalism can work for everyone including the environment when done with compassion and not by greedy social darwinists 
 I'm giving this dvd a 1 star not because all three episodes are crappy but because 15 is such a let down. Don't get me wrong, 13 and 14 are a must see but in 15 way too much is changed within the personalities of the charachcters it just seems like there are totally different writers this time. Episode 16 isn't quite as bad as 15  but you can tell the story has been greatly thinned out compared to  the first 14 episodes 
 I am an avid reader and love topics dealing with historic mysteries, as well as other various types of fiction and non-fiction.  The writing in this book just plain sucks.  It is laborious to read, and makes a fascinating subject matter completely uninteresting.    In addition to poor authoring, there is the matter of the poor scientific basis.    Every other point they attempt to make is stated as 'we find this to be self evident' or 'we found it reasonable to assume that'.  By all rights, circumstantial evidence should have been enough to convict O.J.  However, in this case, then end result is an odor similar to that of the dairy farms south of Sacramento 
  I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny 
 I guess this dvd is okay for learning some basic movements, but her technique is off.  
 I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when I heard that they were going to make it into a movie, I was estatic. I marked the movie release date on my calander, got my tickets in advance, and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater.  The movie was a huge dissapointment. While I wasn't expecting the movie to be just like the book, I certainly wasn't expecting that. While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie, I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book. The only common thread I found were the names of the characters and the fact that Ella was cursed from birth.  I suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie, it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears, despite the fact that I've read it over 100 times 
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Unfortunately the book I ordered turned out to be the American version (light cover) I really wanted the English version (black cover).  The book is known to be a great book, no plaudits required - I just wish it had been made quite clear which version I would receive. (Illustration showed English version). 
 In the quest to reduce waste, you would do well to eliminate this book from your reading list.  If you are looking for a guide to visual management (tools, techniques), this book comes up (way) short.  Although the author acknowledges that visual management is part of a lean workplace, it is obvious she has little knowledge or experience with either.  Her utter lack of understanding of accepted terminology, redefining of basic definitions, bad examples, and other glaring errors make this book a 'must miss'.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one (put the money in your retirement fund! 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 This book tries to persuade the reader that  predjudices, biased opinions, ect. have led the west to unjustly distrust the followers of Islam.  It is understood by most that  the Muslims of Bosnia (for example) are nothing like those in the  midde east, which has become a breeding ground for hate and violence.  Children are taught from the earliest days to hate Jews and almost everyone else.  I think one should examine the thoughts of Islam by spending a week or so reading Aljazeera online re: ((...)). Then, if you are still so inclined to do so, waste your money on this book.  (... 
 Towards the middle of 1988, Castro, who had taken personal control of the war, wanted to withdraw from Angola and discussions began on how this could be accomplished without losing face. One of Castro's top generals in Angola had already tried to defect and Moscow was pressing Castro to reach a settlement. The Cuban leader adopted an aggressive stance and threw more Cuban troops into the front line in order to lend weight to his negotiating position in the peace talks. General Del Pino, who also defected to the West, pointed out that it was pure bluff on Castro's part and that he feared defeat was imminent.  Cuban forces, integrated with SWAPO units, nevertheless pressed on to within 12 kilometres of the Namibian border. Facing 11,000 Cubans and perhaps 2,000 SWAPO was a force of 500 battle-hardened men from 32 "Buffalo" Battalion, the only available troops at the border until reinforcements could arrive. They held the line until tanks and artillery could be moved up. Cuban MiG-23s joined the fray and one was shot down. As the South African forces prepared to move North to engage the Cubans in what promised to be a Cuban nemesis, the Cubans signed the New York peace accords and avoided disaster.  The Cubans immediately claimed victory, which Bridgland points out was 'nonsense', but that:  the Cuban story was taken at face value by Castro's sympathisers in the Western press and repeated so many times that it became received truth. The Cubans were helped by the South Africans' own clumsy efforts at propaganda, which amounted to saying as little as possible about the full-scale war they fought in Angola. The SADF at no stage had wanted an all-out war that would take them to Luanda as conquerors. Their objectives had been to fight a limited war in support of UNITA and prevent the Cubans from capturing UNITA's strongholds. The SADF had succeeded in this and was content to let the Cubans take the limelight. As Bridgland points out in his final summary of the war:  The War for Africa and the New York accords provided Cuba with pretexts for slipping out of a commitment that had become too hot and too expensive to handle. In 1975, when the Cuban adventure in Angola began, the 'scientific socialist' and 'internationalist' tide running from Moscow looked unstoppable. By 1988 it was a faded dream. Despite 13 years of Cuban support, the Angolan economy was ruined. The Marxist MPLA was in utter disarray and was trying desperately to shed its 'scientific-socialist' past... Castro's dreams of a Marxist revolution spreading from Angola to encompass the whole of Southern Africa had become a poor music hall joke...  "The War for Africa" by Fred Bridgland....the most accurate account of Cuba's involvement in the Angolan conflict. 
 I think this book would be great for the college educated, wealthy house wife that is looking for her next adventure. I don't fit that category. Some of us are just trying to pay the mortgage and find decent health coverage. You have to be in a position to make the choices Ms. Beck suggests before you have the freedom to act on them. 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 I thought this was a pretty bitter screed that was more about her life and self-absorbed (as well as self-indulgent) negativity than Julia Child or food. I was also embarrassed for this woman's husband, whose dirty laundry was aired in a book ostensibly about cooking. I was really disappointed with the whining. 
 What a great concept for a book!  I bought this book on the title alone to read Mr. Klein's thoughts on this very intruiging concept.  Unfortunately, what I bought was a Ph.D. thesis written for Ph.D.s and graduate students preparing to become Ph.D.s.  Required reading for every manager and executive?  I think not - not until it's translated into English 
 I tried to install at my house with only 20 feet range but I was getting static noise.  Only way I could make it work was by disconnecting our 2.4GHz cordless telephone (Panasonic) unit.  I tried to contact the customer service but nobody are answering the phone.  I was on hold for 30 minutes twice and it was answered by a voice mailbox 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film 
 This record is so bad, it's embarrassing to think it was ever recorded, must less recorded by a rock legend of Lennon's stature.    The politics are hokey-dopey, the musicianship sloppy, the attitude humorless.  Yoko's "tortured child screech" mars nearly every cut, making the album refuse on those grounds alone.  The only listenable song is Lennon's homage to his new home, "New York City" on which Yoko does not vocalize.  The live cuts are poorly recorded, overlong, half-baked jams, in the manner of the extra disc on Harrison's "All Things Must Pass" album.    It's astounding to think this is the same musician who wrote all those songs on the White Album.  But then again, Dylan followed up his best 60s work with some horrid early 70s releases too.   
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 Not only this book is poorly written but in fact its also written in a very confusing manner. Dr. Kreinin does not provide us with adequate examples for the topic he discusses and furthermore there is not glossary in the textbook, which is crucial for the students to get some quick facts without memorizing the entire terminology used in the book. I was surprised to find this book as part of the required readings for classes at Michigan State University and Northern Michigan University. I recommend that this bok may not be used as part of the curriculum for the students. It is not helpful and its over-priced relative to its limited use

 The price I payed is higher than the price on the receit I received 
 ... is the question my girls asked me.  I was looking for an empowering book for my 4 yr old twin girls and this title caught my eye.  The second page of this book shows the king crying at the bedside of his pale wife who has just died giving birth to her one and only daughter!!  Not something I expected from a book that has an empowering title and leaves me asking why oh why does the mommy have to die in order for the girl to grow up brave and strong??  So sad.  This book went in the trash pile 
 This may have been fun to listen to...16 years ago. A lot of the music from back then has aged into some of the best music of all time. This has not. This CD is just not that good to be honest with you. It is very immature (which is not a bad thing), but you can tell, like the reviewer below me has said, that they lived off of controversy and not true talent. If you want some real rap, or just good music in general, I think that you should look elsewhere 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 The ending to a horror movie can make or break it & just like 'I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER''URBAN LEGENDS' & many more flops since Wes Craven's original & excellent slasher parody 'SCREAM' Craven's follow up 'SCREAM 2' is ridiculously broken by its ultra lame ending. It was a decent slasher flick most of the way through & then destroid by its ending! I truly believe that this is one of the movies that marks the beginning of Wes Craven falling off the great horror director wagon! I mean come on look at his most recent flops 'RED EYE' & the absolute intolerable 'CURSED'. What happend Wes!  
 This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.  Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break! 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 The Linksys WIP320 offers good sound quality but: - Battery weak; lasts an hour in speaking, you have to charge it always during standby to make sure you have enough power when a call comes in. - Had several situations where the phone made a reset by itself or didn't reacted anymore (so the battery had to be removed, then it would restart). - Can't join wireless networks which require authentication - offers just a few ringtones to choose from and they all sound horrible. There's also no way to load additional ringtones via the USB port - Somewhere "speakerphone" was mentioned... well, not that I ever managed to get that working. - Headset port doesn't work with every 2.5 plug headset 
 Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem.  I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar.  This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.    Where do I start?  First off, the font size is terrible.  So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant.  Then comes the print type.  It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage.  The printing is extremely bad.  Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy.  Was the typeset dirty?  Did you run out of ink?  True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus.  But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?  How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.   Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.  That is how one presents a text of significance.    If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day.     
 While I am an advocate of the Leap Frog line of products, this one was advertised in such a way that I believed I was getting a "whole product." Unbeknownst to me (1st time Dad @ 50), this was an accessory to a product that requires the initial purchase of the e-book, etc. While I have had nothing but praise for Leap Frog products and will probably seek out the components to use it, it was disappointing...and a lesson learned re caveat emptor; buyer beware 
 I did enjoy reading this book but after a while Bare's stories about his more "famous" friends got a little tiresome. And I always found myself wondering, who is Richard Bare? Is he responsible for any of the greatest films of all time? The answer is no. In fact, Richard Bare's greatest achievement was directing all of the episodes of Green Acres. And that's it, most of credits are for television, not film. Personally, if I were to read a book about film directing, I'd like to read a book by a reknowned director, like David Mamet's "On Directing Film". Mamet was able to get through everything that goes into directing a film in a slim 107 page book. I'd recommend that book over this book any day 
 The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history. The books is misleading in that regard 
 I certainly agree with some of the reviewers: the book is boring; reading long, useles stories is just time consuming. It is not supposed to be a momoir: it should be a MANUAL "how to organize your life". You cannot learn it from a book which is, in many ways, not very well organized 
 Many basic psychological words and terms are missing.  Was unimpressed with the definitions 
 Ok, I had to watch this movie for my Earth Science class, and it was good, but oh my God. I wanted to just punch some people! It was decent, only because of Tommy Lee Jones and Don Cheadle (I don't know how to spell his last name, but you know whom I'm talking about). Anyone else? Pf. Not cool.  Tommy Lee Jones plays this emergency help guy/dad, and he does it well. In the movie he fathers this 13-year old who can't really grasp onto the word "responsibility" until the very end. Its weird that he doesn't know what 'lava' is. You'll find that a bit weird.  Theres a part in the movie, where the construction guy (real ass in the beginning) goes in a subway car and saves the already dead driver, and he's moving sloooowly, murmuring a prayer, and when he gets to the ledge, the lava hasn't moved from out and under the subway yet. He stands there, hesitating. I was shouting "JUMP" like an obnoxious idiot. Then the lava came from under the subway train, and it flowed like, five feet in front of him. Finally (!) he jumps, throws the dead man to his co-workers and melts.  Another death scene: 2 geologists go down into the storm drain, and one finds the fissure. She's peeking in it, observing, concurring. Then, like a flash, an earthquake. The other geologist is messing with her flashlight, so she really doesn't notice what's happening. The concurring one suddenly tries to move away from it, but the fissure widens, which makes her fall. Heres the suspenseful part: shes hanging on the ledge. "Help me! Don't let go of me!" she begs, as the other geologist grabs her arm. Sadly, the glove that the ailing woman was wearing slides off, and bam. Dies.  TLJ's on-screen daughter is in charge of 2 children at a shelter. She goes off somewhere and comes back to find the youngest gone. So, she goes and looks for him and finally finds him outside where the BIG eruption was going to happen. The building behind her, though, is about to collapse. She like, realizes this, and she just stands there, holding the child, wailing for her dad. Its like, 'ok, RUN'.  OVERALL. This movie is ok if you like the whole disaster film thing. Its cheesy, but its good. I prefer this to Twister. It will make you not want to live in/move out of California, though. That's a caution you should take 
 What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good 
 right off the bat, JJ runs into an indian in the middle of nowhere, the indian has is gun JJ doesnt, oh boy the tension fills the air, no wait, for the FIRST TIME EVER, the indian turns and rides away, does NOT kill the white man, who is all alone on the Indians land, trying to catch HIS fish.     liberal revisionist trying to make the indian look like he is better than the white man, and oh smarter also, for just after that, JJ is trying to get a fire going "but" does this under a tree that has snow all over it, he gets the fire going and oh darn!  snow fell on it!  dumb white man!    If this movie didnt have superstar Robert Redford in it, would of been just another dumb movie, like that idiot Timmy that made Grizzly Man.     An Indian that lets a white man live all out in the middle of nowhere, LOL!  yes the white man stole the land, yes the white man did this that and everything else to the indians.   But its not like they were angels, they fought with each other just like the rest of the world has always done throught history.   to deny that, is just plain stupid.   The 1970's, marks the turning point the liberals took over Hollyweird.  Clint Eastwood never would of made this move in the 1960's, or ever.     
 I did not enjoy this book at all.  I didn't think the verses were witty or interesting, and I was hoping it would actually have some helpful information in it.  I teach science and I'm always looking for clever ways to help students learn material.  This was not helpful 
 I just recently ordered and received "Color in Garden Design".  I struggled through the first 26 pages and finally put the book down uninspired and totally uninformed.  It's not because I don't have a good working knowledge of color.  I do. I have painted with oil paints for many years.  I just thought "Color in Garden Design" would give a fresh perspective on color for the GARDENER.  Was I wrong. The author goes off in "left field" somewhere when she tries to explain color. The text is very, very wordy, unclear and not concise. I don't know what point Ms. Austin is trying to make. I'm sure Ms. Austin has a wonderful KNOWLDEGE of how to use color in the garden for herself and her clients.  However, the problem lies in her trying to TEACH color in the garden to others. This is not a book to learn from. Also, the pictures are very uninspiring. Don't be seduced by the table of contents as I was!  Beginners: there are much, much better books out there on color in the garden.  Those with a working knowledge of color: don't waste your money nor your time 
 However, Amazon does not allow zero star ratings...  I can't even dignify this by calling it a book. Isn't the beauty of Aesop's fables mainly in the brevity of them? Consider the amzing power of Jesus' ultra concise parables. Then take a look at this clunker. If you tried to tow the Queen Mary with a bungee cord, you could not stretch the bungee further than Johnson has stretched his parable in this book. If you actually enjoy this book and get something out of it, perhaps you should hunt up a copy of Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music."  This is the pet rock of literature here. We all wish we had come up with the idea and pocketed the cash. But genius it ain't. Just light your money on fire, if you need to get rid of some. That would be more fun than reading this book 
 Don't read this book if you are an admirer of horror fiction, ala Stephen King or Dean Koontz.   This is slash and smash horror, full of pat phrases and not very well written.  I guess this is horror for horror's sake, or horror for high school drop outs.  I kept reading it because I kept thinking maybe things will get better.  The plot is better than the writing, which is a shame because it could have been a really good book. 
 He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak.  All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful.  The self delusion in the book is amazing 
 This book is not for those who want to either learn mathematica graphics or extend their knowledge, as in my case. It is not clear who the audience is for this book. The book starts with graphics primatives (points, lines, polygons, etc), by page 10 your building 2D plots of rotated Cantor sets that have little to do with the topic at hand. By page 49, examples of inverted Farey fractions illustrate something having to do with Graphics, but what it is has already been lost. It only gets worse, roughly each page has a dense set of mathematica code for generating esoteric graphics. And their is about one to two sentences to describe this code. You are left on your own to unravel it. As and intermediate user of Mathematica and one whose been using it since version 1.0. I find the coding hard to understand. (Remember there is no explation) Thus, this book is not for beginners and folks like me. Its target is for those who work at Wolfram Research, such as the author, and play with Mathemeatica all day. In this case, they already understand the material. This book is a disaster 
 This is the first craps strategy book I've read. I'm reading a second now in preparation for an upcoming trip to Vegas.  Forever Craps was a disappointment. There's an occasional tip that seems reasonable, but it states the obvious a lot... what a pass line bet is, what ALL the bets are. Unless you've never even stepped up to a craps table and thrown the dice, it goes on for a while with obvious information.  I'm not disputing the concept of controlling the dice, but this book doesn't really help you find that control 
 Product was difficult to setup and didnt come with complete instructions.  Had to call tech support (India?) and after 30 min. on the phone was able to complete the installation.  Unfotunately after all that work I discovered that my printer (Xerox) was one of the "few" printers not compatable with the Netgear wireless print server 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 I was very interested with this book because Grandmaster Kosten is a good chess writer and he is a regular user of the English opening, but the book is disappointing. Fisrt of all take note that this is not a reference book nor a book for beginners. Kosten writes 16 chapters dealing with the endless variations of the English, so with 144 pages at his disposal he has to be brief and - alas - superficial. You'll learn nothing studying this book unless you are such a good player - 2300 rated or higher - to understand the ideas Kosten illustrates. Indeed Kosten explains his own way of playing the opening and this is an interesting topic, but absolutely unuseful to the average player 
 I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions. Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
        Have you ever read a book that has a wildlife shelter, a boy obsessed with natural disasters, a girl that carried a 40-pound seal on her back while rock-climbing, a lost racoon and an arrogant bear? I didn't think so. Well, now here's your chance, with Jackie's Wild Seattle. While Shannon and Cody'd parents are busy in Afganistan working with Docters Without Borders for the whole summer, they have stay with their uncle Neal in Seattle. During their visit, because Uncle Neal volunteers at Jackie's Wild Seattle, a wildlife rescue organization, the two kids get to explore wildlife in a new and closer way, while they help their uncle save animals.         Will Hobbs writes this book in the perspective of Shannon, a 14-year old girl who loves adventures and is a bit more practical then her younger brother, Cody. Cody is 7 years old and loves animals and natural disasters. Uncle Neal is very passionate for animals, and is nice and welcoming to his niece and nephew, but Shannon has some suspicions about him. She will not stop trying to figure out why he is not being open with them.         I really liked this book and I would recommend it to someone who liked animal and adventure novels. Since I am not much of an animal book lover, i didn't like this book as much as some of my friends did, but i enjoyed reading it 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I think they have the age range wrong for "Another Important Book."  Rather than being for 4 to 8 year-olds, I think 3 and under might be more accurate.  Certainly my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) had little interest in this book.  They found the drawings too babyish and the content just did not spark any calls for another reading.    Counting to 6?  I've found my toes?  Just all 'non-starters' for preschoolers and kindergarteners, unlike the original "The Important Book" which dealt with observations of the world around us.  Two Stars (for the 3 and up age range).  Check the images that Amazon has provided to decide on appropriateness for your child.   For those interested in revisiting babyhood with older children we suggest Margaret Miller's "Now I'm Big" 
 I was more interested in technique and tips for cooking with my new convection oven and this was a poor resource The recipes are ordinary. Personally, I wouldn't have bought it had I known how mediocre this book was 
 I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.   The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!  There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.  The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst. 
 If James K. Polk hadn't very unexpectedly become president of the United States in 1845, nobody today would have heard of him.  The accomplishments he is remembered for -- the annexation of Texas, the acquiring of Oregon Territory from Britain, the War with Mexico and resultant annexation of New Mexico and California -- he was able to accomplish only BECAUSE he became president.  So why does John Seigenthaler devote less than forty of 156 pages of text to Polk's presidency in his book, JAMES K. POLK?  JAMES K. POLK is one of "The American Presidents" series which are supposed to concentrate on the PRESIDENCIES of the chief executives, not the whole lives of the men themselves.  Admitted, exploring the biographical and historical background and the process by which particular individuals are able to win the White House over the opposition of many other contenders is essential to understanding the presidencies they spawn -- doubly so in Polk's case as America's first "dark horse" president.  But the other equally short contributions to this series are quite capable of covering such material in the first thirty or forty pages of text, leaving the remaining one hundred plus to discuss the presidency itself.  Given the constraints of this series and the incredible presidency that was to be Polk's, it is Seigenthaler's DUTY to do the same.  I bought this book to learn how a president, whom I knew very little about, was able in four short years to create, for better or worse, a United States that finally spread "from sea to shinning sea".  Thirty some pages is nowhere near enough text to discuss the complications that Polk had to deal with in his War with Mexico alone, particularly when Polk thought he could annex California WITHOUT going to war.  Seigenthaler hardly mentions the problems that the obstinate Democrat Polk had with his two equally headstrong Whig generals, Taylor and Scott, or the increasingly fierce opposition he faced as the war dragged on and on.  Ditto for the Oregon Territory dispute with the British.  He devotes more text to Polk's establishing an independent Treasury and lowering the import tariffs, but these achievements pale in comparison to the previous two   Seigenthaler wastes far more text telling the story of how the washed-up ex-governor from Tennessee hoping for the vice-presidential candidacy, won the 1844 Democratic Party's presidential nomination instead when neither of the two top contenders could secure a majority.  Then Seigenthaler proceeds with an almost equally long description of the campaign itself -- during which Polk did NOT make public campaign promises to annex California and gain the Oregon border treaty with England, but merely promised to accept the annexation of Texas and serve only one term.  The "four goals" that he had for his presidency he first confided to his secretary of the navy AFTER becoming president (check out pp. 102, 3).  Imagine a book of some one hundred fifty pages about another rather obscure ex-congressman from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln that devotes less than forty to his presidency and barely mentions the Civil War.  Change the main character and you've got John Seigenthaler's JAMES K. POLK.     
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 Sorry, but I only like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chen. Who is gonna even try to look for some third actor movies? Jet Li is the third star, but Bruce is the best, he is my brother and all.. 
 Jones' contempt for Morrison oozes out of every page. It is so vicious, you will be left wondering why he subjected himself to the seeming torture of typing Morrison's nam 
 Well today Feb 25 of 2007 the book still don't arrive .. 
 The "orchestra" was so loud one could barely hear the singers...a very unprofessional DVD...the "sighing" girlies"  in audience had better coverage than the rest offered (and they weren't much".)  I'll stick with DVD's starring Andre Rieu which are always Five Star and then some.  Live and Learn 
 Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?)  The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover.  This was a guy I could get to like.  Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars.  If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated.  Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs?  Sure.  Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book.  I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already 
    Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art.     On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews.  We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not.   We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that.  If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
 Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad "Be Not Always" and the danceable "State of Shock."    "State of Shock" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, "Body" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, "Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!" or words to that effect.   
 Gimme a break. Soooooo lame. 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive.  Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too).  Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99?  Oh well... I'll wait 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 The presentation of this book is confusing. The book presented is the study guide to Mankiw's "Priciple of Economics" prepared by David Hakes, not a paperback Edition of the Hardcover Testbook. Caveat Emptor 
  This particular Sudoku handheld was not as expected. It has only basic functions and the person I purchased for said it is easier just to do Sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book. Really inconvenient functions. May be good for young children, but not adults 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I got this book at a garage sale and I was really looking forward to reading it.  I heard so much about it and was surprised when I also found it in the library, multiple copies, under classics.    I really like historical counts of the sixties counter culture but this never kept my interest to keep picking it up again.  If you finally got interested in something, to follow along like a story or a sensible account, it just dropped it.  I never found myself really caring about the people involved.  Everything was just there, but the people were acting like everything they did had some great meaning, and it just seemed tired.    I got thru 150 pages.  I had to quit.  I skimmed the rest of it really really quickly to get the jist of it.  I looked up a summary of the book on the net, and I didn't miss anything in the plot.  I wanted to like this book. But, no go.  Maybe you just had to be there...or be "zonked"... 
 Its a beautifully rendered world.  I saved many screenshots.  But the game gets very boring after a few days.  This game has everything, horses, individual armors, unique weapons, etc.  But what it doesn't have is sustainable fun.  You can sneak around and steal the world blind, but 98% of the things to steal is cheese, apples and clay servingware.  Ok yes, that is what makes up 98% of the items in a RL house, but if Real Life was exciting we wouldn't be playing RPGs.  The little pocket hells that you have to enter are repetitive, and have very little good loot (what it has is heavy and undervalued considering the items come from demons).  ESIII has poorer graphics (cuz its older duh!), but a better story and better NPCs.  The problem is, I don't have an alternative to suggest since Gothic 3 and NWN2 are also disappointing.  At least this still has the unrestricted travel 
 You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 Don't waste your money on this book, unless you want to go back to older versions of Linux... Many of the links are gone, many of the programs don't work with the newer versions of Linux (post 2004), and buying this book in September 2005 was basically flushing nearly $50 down the toilet.. 
 Brandon Sanderson's debut deserves great praise for offering the rarest of fantasies:  a stand-alone novel.  Furthermore, he eschews the classic tropes of fantastical races in favor of a modern-fantasy type medieval world fragmented by religious politics and a mysterious biological plague.  Unfortunately, little else in _Elantris_ is as original or promising as the concept.  The pace is numbingly slow, especially in the early chapters of Sarene discovering her way through Arelon.  Huge passages of expository dialog between her and her Tinker Bell-like floating confidant serve only to dump background information on the reader.  Clunky prose repeatedly distracts from the tale.  Sanderson's fantasy names are too similar to avoid confusion, often starting with the same series of letters:  Derethi religion and Dathreki Mountains, arteth priest and Arelon kingdom, Fjon the priest and Fjordell the religion.    Worse still, the characters are shallow modern archetypes--the tables-turned prince and his world-wise new friend, the harsh militant priest, and the perky young princess who changes the world.  They react most predictably to the situations they face, and many of those situations seem gratuitously engineered by the author to force the outcome he wishes.  The dialog is laughably wooden, lines that real people would never say.  "'Something just doesn't feel right here,'" Sarene tells Ashe at one point, and she's exactly right.  Sanderson's concept is wise and full of potential, but his writing is not yet equal to that challenge 
 This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund 
 I bought this video for my four year old son because he's a Spider-man fanatic.  Little did I know that this series is not meant for children.  When we started to watch with him, I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I flipped the box over to find the rating (never dreaming there was one since I bought this in a toy store right next to a stack of Teletubbie videos!)  There is a PGV rating on the back for violence but they don't tell you about the adult language as well as the sexual references.  Needless to say we shut it off and tried to distract him with a more appropriate video for his age.  I don't know if I'd let my 16 year old watch this 
 When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale.  The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes.  However, when I  got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on  assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which  the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients.  If I were  submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for  me.  It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 The book can be used as a repository of useful anecdotes. However, it doesn't bring much new. If you're a beginner in the SCM field then it will definitely open your eyes to some operational challenges companies face all the time. But for the experienced professional, this book is of no great value (some of the anecdotes are interesting though)... We, as supply chain professionals, need to upgrade our thinking and admit that our role is not to eliminate uncertainty but rather mitigate it... and that's the best we can do... as such, one cannot possibly come up with a bullet proof model but rather an approach to handle risk... the key attribute to all of this thinking is how much risk we can live with? that's it... truly, that's all that's needed to be told! My reaction to the example of Apple reducing its inventory and then getting a major supply disruption because of some disaster in Asia is So? What can you do? The only thing you can is to define your tolerance for risk and conduct some tradeoff analysis: what matters more? keeping low level of inventory and therefore reducing likelihood and scope of obsolescence (tangible)? or is it minimizing potential for lost sales (intangible)? That's the basic question 
 Works great for partitioning a hard drive but when it comes to adding another operating system. I've been pulling out my hair. The directions are vague and the customer service stinks. Everything is done with email and if you want to talk to someone it will cost you 29.99 for a one time occurance. Check it out at www.acronis.com . Look around before you buy. If I would have I would have never had bought this product. 
 Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely. 
 I am the owner of a kamado, purchased in August of 2000 when the company wan located in Sacramento, CA. After owning the unit for less than two years, I started to develop cracks in the interior of the kamado. the company would not replace or honor the life time warranty on the unit. Since that time the tiles have come loose in sheets and I have a defective unit that is unsightly and not what I purchased with the supposed lifetime warranty. All calls and emails to the company would not resolve the defects in materials and workmanship. The company's answer is to glue the tiles back on the unit. This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement. This material will not last and carries no lifetime warranty. I am sorry to give them one star, they don't have a negative star number. check out this company with San Diego BBB and Sacramento BBB and read before you buy. There are various website that deal with the fraud of the kamado group. Their website does not allow any truthful posts. The truthful posts are removed almost immediately. As they say on eBay, BUYER BEWARE, FRAUD, AND NOT WHAT THEY REPRESENT. There are true ceramic cookers out there for sale, that are truly ceramic and not ceramic coated tiles in grout. Good Luc 
 I bought this book based on the reviews that I read here and was very disappointed with it.  Coconut oil may be a good idea but the sketchy research in this book didn't convince me.  The recipes sound good but have many fancy, hard-to-find ingredients and are just too time-consuming to be practical.  I have only used one recipe from the book, as I found all the others to be impractical. Take the Thai Chicken Soup for example:  It has 16 different ingredients, 10 of which have to be chopped, sliced or bruised and many of which would be difficult to find and/or expensive such as lemongrass, galanga root, Thai fish sauce and Kaffir lime leaves.  Most regular grocery stores wouldn't even carry all those items.    The Phase I of the diet is a 21-Day Weight Loss Kickoff which consists of three meals per day and two snacks.  Some examples of the snacks are:   herbal tea and 6 macadamia nuts (no joke, thats all you get for that mid-morning snack) 12 raw or toasted almonds  1 celery stalk stuffed with goat cheese 3-4 sardines packed in mustard sauce  6 pecan halves  3 radishes and 4 green olives These are all individual snacks, not combined! If you normally eat like a bird, this might work for you but if you normally have a real snack, 6 macadamia nuts with sparkling water.  Phase II is a section on cleansing: first colon cleansing, then liver cleansing, gallbladder cleansing and finally kidney cleansing.  You may as well forget this phase if you don't have a juicer and all day to devote to the schedule.  For example for liver cleansing you would start your day like this: 7:00 or upon rising, drink 1 cup hot water with the juice of 1/4 lemon and a dash of cayenne pepper.  7:15 Beet juice cocktail (juice cucumber, carrots, a beet with greens, celery, ginger root and lemon).  8:00  any breakfast suggestion from the breakfast recipes and include raw food  take 1-2 capsules of the herb milk thistle or liver cleansing herbs  9:00 1-2 teaspoons Beet Salad (recipe on page 226)  10:30 ginger or echinacea tea  11:00 1-2 teaspons Beet Salad.  Sound like a lot of work?  And you are only up to 11:00!  It continues until 8:30 p.m.  Phase III is Introducing Healthy Carbs where you get to add a few more carbohydrates.  The meals are still a lot of work and the snacks are still tiny (you can have 6-10 macadamia nuts!)  Phase IV is Maintaining Your Healthy Weight.  More of the same but who could stick with it that long anyway?  Unless you love to spend the whole day in the kitchen and have a lot of time and money and have nothing better to do, you won't like this program.  Coconut oil may be worth a try but this book really isn't.  I like to eat healthy but this plan is rediculous 
 The biggest problem with this book is the unbelievable main character, Helen.  She's forever pleased with herself and obsessed with her own charm. Consequently, she's totally unlikable.  Schine's writing is unimaginative and she fails to make me care about the story 
 this may easily be one of the dumber movies made in the last hundred years.  and there were a lot of them.  this definitely ranks up in the 10%-tile 
 This flick is like a prequel to "Hogan's Heroes."  The Allied POWs are plucky, cocky and handsome.  The German soldiers who guard them are bumbling oafs.  At the end of the movie the German guns come out and many of the POWs are slaughtered.  Disgusting 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 The Kite Rider. A book centered completely on the importance of obedience. A small boy living in a small village of 13th century china has to overcome everything that is taught to him and above all from the importance of obedience to the importance of respect for your elders. Through being strapped to a kite and being used as a wind tester for a merchant vessel, Haoyou's father, Gou Pei, is brutally killed by first mate Di Chou, and that sets Haoyou's life in for a whirlwind of events he could not have imagined possible. After the horrific loss to Haoyou's family, Di Chou even tries so marry his mother -Qing An- an ambition he has long had. When Haoyou's greedy, gambling addicted uncle agrees immediately, Haoyou and his cousin Mipeng know they must do something. They send Di Chou (completely drunk) on a vessel, but to do that Haoyou bribes the seamen by being a wind tester. This brings The Great Miao, circus master of the Jade Circus looking for Haoyou to be one of his acts. Once again, Great Uncle Bo agrees for the money that he knows he can make out of it. Haoyou's kite riding act does well until the Jade Circus reaches the court of Kublai Khan, ruler of Cathay in 13th century china. There Bo challenges the Mongols to a kite ride, where the first person to come back to earth lost the bet. Haoyou wins, but he also happens to land in the Khans place of worship, a wagon full of grass and earth from the Mongolian steppes. This infuriates the Khan, and Haoyou is almost killed for his crime, had he not been offered as a secret weapon in the Khans moving army.  This novel was really not that great a book for me personally. It was just too short and lacking that factor that makes me want to read more of it. It was far too simple a plot too. Its like a ten page book with 250 pages of vague details scattered in between the words. This is the first book I have read by Geraldine McCaughrean, and it is not inspiring me to read the second.  
 This could have been a nice little movie; it almost is. The plot is blissfully uncomplicated, much like a Marx Brother's film, but even at his oldest, Groucho never seemed as old as Rodney does in this DVD. The idea of going to the ends of the earth to win the love of your lady is timeless. But with a thirty-something leading lady and an eighty-something leading man, searching for your Viagara and your teeth would seem like a more realistic quest. I'm especially disappointed that there were no memorable "Rodney lines" like in Caddy Shack - "Oh that's the worst looking hat I ever saw ... looks good on YOU though." A sweethearted, non-wise cracking Rodney didn't work for me. Honestly, I feel bad not loving this movie. I am a Rodney fan - have all of his records (yup, on vinyl), DVDs and CDs too.  I have seen him live and use his lines all day long - "I went to the doctor, I said doc, when I wake up and I look in the mirror, I wanna throw up, what's wrong with me? he said, I don't know, but your eyesight's perfect!"  But in this film he was mis-cast.  Picture Billy Crystal in the lead and you know what I mean. Anyway, if you love Rodney, maybe you shouldn't see this movie. It's just too painful. I had to go watch Caddy Shack a couple of times to get over it. I originally wrote this review back in June of 2004 - Rodney was still with us and making those around him laugh. He's gone and there will never be another 
 Yup, not to marginalize the other people who made the show great, but that's basically what it boils down to.  When I saw none of these people in the opening credits, I was concerned.  The people who did make this movie, however, confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film, if not just plain sucky.  I mean seriously, this wouldn't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show, let a lone a film.    In one of the extras, the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a "fun" film and that they finished the script in no time at all.  Guess what, it shows.  That is except for the fun part, but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent.  The plot is extremely cliched and stupid.  Maybe if any of the 3 girls were interesting at all, it would've been passable.  However, we ended up with an extremely annoying, rebeling daddy's girl who looks like a Hale Berry clone, a Renee Montoya clone, and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend.  Yeah, why should I give a crap about any of these chicks?  In the extras they said they didn't want to do something definitive with Batwoman, but I call it laziness and lack of effort.  If Batwoman's secret identity was one good character it might have worked, but instead we get three worthless ones.    I was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after I heard the idea to bring Batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie.  However, any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent.  I did like the fact that they continued the Barbara/Bruce text, but it was only in one short scene.  I guess having Batgirl and Batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason I can't comprehend.  The music to this movie isn't that great as everyone else said, especially compared to Shirley Walker's beyond amazing score.  However, I disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good.  It looked like low-budget, digitally colored, corny crap to me.  Definitely no where even close to the amazing, noir-influced film making from the tv show.  I was also a fan of Penguin's voice in the show, but here he's played by the Mad Hatter's voice actor instead.  I don't know if Penguin's voice acotr died or that he was just busy, but Penguin just wasn't the same this way.    Oever all, I can't find much to like in this film.  I did find the inclusion of fan-service including Batwoman's costume a nice gesture, but definitely not enough to save this film.  So yeah, only get this if you're a completest.  If you're just starting to buy Batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead.  Every episode is much more enjoyable than this half-baked movie 
 As an individual who was very new to the paralegal profession, I found that the book was only minimally beneficial in that many of the explanations and legal terms were not clearly defined or explained...It definitely left me feeling like I needed help from other sources.. 
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
 This book is about a ung boy named bud and is liveing with a bad family that is mean to him after a while and they lock in a shed one night and he desides to run away.When he runs away he sleeps under a tree in front of a libary that serves beakfeast and so on.Then after a couple nights he leaves the tree and trys to find his father.after hours of walking a man picks him up and helps him try and find his father 
 This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst.  We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it.  But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying.  If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it.  Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN!  (I had it confused with John Wayne's "Rooster Cogburn" and the Dennis Weaver's "McCloud" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.)  The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story.  This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes 
 Many people who are looking at this book probably already know about the life and works of microtonal composer and instrument inventor Harry Partch.  (If you don't, you'd find great enjoyment in seeking this out!)  I play on these instruments at the Harry Partch Instrumentarium at Montclair State University in NJ.  How upsetting it was to immediately and excitedly turn to this book's section on Harry Partch's musical system to find the entire system misrepresented.  The author says that his just intoned system starts on "C", when it really starts on "G".  Therefore, all of the examples displayed are wrong and need to be transposed a fourth down.  How infuriating 
 I am a big Dawn fan, so I miss Dawn.They could've replaced Dawn with someone better than Abby. Abby is an obnoxious eigth grader who thinks she is so funny. Abby shows of that she is so cool. In the book she tries to help her mom and sister ajust to Stoneybrook. Abby should have never joined the club. Kristy is right when she says that Abby is a bad baby-sitter. Abby should have never joined the club 
 First off, this CD is nothing like Juno Reactor's other stuff.  Track 1 is the RADIO EDIT of "Hotaka" and is drastically shortened and dwarfed by it's counterpart, Track 2, 12" Dance Version.  In fact, I never listen to Track 1.  It's short and not worth listening to.  "It's for the radio", you might say, but this song really isn't meant for the radio.  Hotaka is just too OUT THERE, for it's own good, if you know what I mean?  If you really want to listen to "Hotaka", just purchase Odyssey 1992-2002.  You will find "Hotaka", in all it's glory, as the last song.  The last 2 tracks are Trans/Techno mixes.  I REALLY like Track 4, mixed by Der Dritte Raum.  With voice quotes mixed form Alice in Wonderland and other obscure out-takes it's so unlike Juno Reactor, it shouldn't even be on this single, but it definitely has it's own style and at least would interest you in Der Drtte Raum's other music.    Track 3 is very "techno"-ish, with a repetitive beat throughout the whole track, so be warned.  The worth of this CD is debatable.  If you're looking to spend $7 bucks + shipping frivolously, then go for it.  Otherwise, save your cash 
 Completely useless to women in their 50s or over 45 --- the book appears to be written for college students and 20s+ whose relationships are primarily based on sex and who have a huge reservoir of available mates from which to choose. It's emphasis upon self-respect is fine.... but the author has no understanding of (nor does the address) the realities of the over 50. 
 1. This book is an artifact of the cold war, so you can't trust everything what is said in it. Moreover, the author is not a professional scientist, he is simply one of ex-prisoners and a writer. This means, he had no access whatsoever to the facts, and his book is based on his reflections and fantasies. 2. If you want to "open your eyers" and believe that the bad guy Stalin asassinated millions of people without any reason then you should read this book. However, if you want to know the truth or something close to the truth, you should read professional research (e.g. Zemskov) or spend your time with the archives, which are open now. 3. There are plenty of lies in this book, indeed. For example, Solzshenitzyn claims that the number of victims is counted in tens of millions. This is certainly not the case (i.e., Gulag has never had more than 2 million people even in the years of s.c. purging; compare this to the number of prisoners per capita in the USA or modern Russia and be ready to get surprised).  The total number of those sentenced to death is near 700,000 over 25 years, many of them were murderers or terrorists, and some of the sentences were not executed, while Solzshenitzyn names 15, 43, 60, and even more than 100 million in his various speeches and books. This is certainly nonsense, because it does not fit any demographic data. 4. The fact that Solzshenitzyn received a Nobel prize does not mean that he is a good writer (there is political agenda behind his nomination). Only a few of his books are worth reading. Judging by a translated work is not sound anyway. 5. Solzshenitzyn is not sincere as well. He is not a "freedom fighter", the reason why he ended in Gulag is that he was escaping the military service. He knew that political convicts were not send to the front, so he did it. At that time, Russia was facing the Nazi Germany in a few kilometers from Moscow 
 When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.  Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?   Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).   So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.  There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.   Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.                
 This book, although it covers a broad range of topics, does not adequately cover any of them.  I teach sewing and bough this book thinking it might be good to use as a text, and was very disappointed.  The pictures are hard to see, the directions vague.  If I did not know what they meant already, I never would have been able to figure it out from this text.  I do not recommend this book to any seamstress at any level 
 I give up... 100+ pages in. I can't take it anymore. It is incredibly boring. The people are unlikeable and vapid. The sex is stupid. Jane Smiley is too talented to write a piece of crap like this. 
 It says:  This Collectors Edition also includes three classic Robert Anton Wilson lectures: The Acceleration of Knowledge, The New Inquisition, and Religion for the Hell of It.  That's completely untrue. The package only contains an interview with Mr. Wilson 
 Terrible assemble. I coudln't even assembel front wheel. The axle is way short, and no axle nut. So there's no way to place wheel in fork drop outs 
 This review will be simple: Garden State is fake, manipulative and annoying.  It tries way too hard, and every "idiosyncratic" element seems forced and insincere.  I hate to offened any reader out there, but the entire time I was watching this flick I had one re-occuring thought:  "This is a movie for Tools."  You know those big-budget, well-shot TV commercials for Cars or Cellphones? It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro-managed and insincere.   The compulsive, overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite. The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots "well" than making a decent movie.  Skip this one!  Cliched, derivative, phoney, forced.  If you're in the mood for something in this 'genre' just rewatch your Wes Anderson collection or maybe 'I Heart Huckabees' or even 'Eternal Sunshine...". Don't waste your time on this drivel 
 Not worth the money buy a different book if you are interesting in learning how to build kitchen cabinets.  This book is random and appears to be chapters of previously published material.  
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable 
 THE LORD OF THE RINGS   I was a teenager back in the mid and late 70s, and JRR Tolkien's popularity was inescapable. I started reading THE HOBBIT, which is a little prequel to this. I don't think I finished it, and I know I never tackled THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I found Tolkien hard to read. Imaginative, sure, and no doubt thematic, but it was like Margaret Mitchell. Unreadable. (Don't start -- I'm from the South.)   Later, I saw an animated version of the trilogy on TV which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes. Naturally it made no sense, because you can't compress all that into such a short time span.   Then, I gave up on Tolkien and played another game of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. I was addicted, folks. Role Playing Games are an author's playground. I didn't play as much as I wanted, because I was too much in demand as a Dungeon Master. Naturally.   But now, in this millennium, let's watch some movies! I live in China, where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan. For those keeping score at home, about US$2.50.   THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING   It was a bit slow getting started, presenting all the back story, but I was surprised later on when I needed it and remembered it so well. Okay, yep, Tolkien's got game. Given his popularity, one would sincerely hope so.   You absolutely have to love the look of Middle Earth. How are they able to adjust everybody's heights? Most of the special effects are impressive.   Most importantly, somehow I feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to Tolkien's vision. In fact, I read somewhere that he did.   I never found elves quite so annoying in my Dungeons & Dragons days as I do now. I bet they never sweat, do they? They talk in riddles and glow too much, but I guess that happens when you live too long.   The various species are quite distinguishable, aren't they? So are different members of the same species. This is masterful. It's a skill far too few modern authors possess. Either everybody in the book seems like the same person, or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort. Tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that, yes, sometimes it's reassuring to a person/character to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require.   Once our fellowship finally goes into battle, we get some great sequences. Among many fine performances, those of Frodo and Gandalf stand out in my mind. Oh, and "never toss a dwarf," which I KNOW Tolkien didn't write. Anxiously awaiting part two.   THE TWO TOWERS   What's more boring than real world politics? Fictional politics! I don't believe Tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect. Well, I hope he didn't. Saruman makes a bunch of uber-Orcs and sics 'em on humanity. Fine. We don't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles. Nor do we need the lamest excuse for a "love story" in cinematic history.   But once we FINALLY get past all that, I believe we get back to the Tolkien vision. Here's hoping we stay there for part three.   (Two hours, two paragraphs. What's wrong with this picture?)   THE RETURN OF THE KING   A balanced attack. That's what THE TWO TOWERS lacks but THE RETURN OF THE KING has. By this, I mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring. That's not your "action," unless your name's Jackie Chan. Give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point, then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater.   {No hate mail from Jackie Chan fans, please. I love SHANGHAI NOON.}   The real drama comes in the interpersonal, and in Frodo versus that @#$%^* ring. Gollum is one freaky deaky, ain't he? Liv Tyler is still unwatchable, but fortunately her screen time was minimal.   We get very close to the end of this film before Hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes. Those very cool elephants, for example, seem unstoppable. I was quite impressed with Orlando Bloom's quietly effective performances, but I'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas. Those elephants are doomsday machines, and the heroes' strongholds were Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Meanwhile back at the ranch, perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility. Sam the Hobbit versus HOW MANY orcs? Um, lest we forget, he's only a freakin hobbit!   I don't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps Tolkien himself. But, well, somebody damn sure did. Let's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what's on the other side.   Unlike some critics, I appreciated that this film didn't end at the "climax." We needed some more time to just hang out in Middle Earth, well over 9 hours after we entered the place, without all that pseudo-violent cast-of-thousands FX crap.   However, anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead, and that includes the entire elven race. You can leave your Shire without leaving your world, Tolkien. I did. I've been in China since 1999.   THE VERDICT   I appreciate Tolkien's imagination, and I'm glad the film people made this. But I know it could be so much better with an editor. Yeah, I'm talking about changing what Tolkien wrote if required.   (There goes another subscriber...)   I read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they don't think Tolkien wrote enough. I disagree. I think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better.   (And there goes another subscriber...)   Nothing about this movie changed my opinion. I was happy to watch it once, but I can't imagine anyone wading through it twice. I've swapped it for a copy of the GODFATHER trilogy, which I'll review in a future issue of WHO MOVED MY RICE?  
 This was not what I expected, I love "food" movies like "Eat drink man woman", "Tortilla Soup", "Like Water for Chocolate",This movie was just a long boring trek through bad accents and poorly lit italian food, I realize that the food was supposed to be showcased here, but it didnt wet my appetite a bit, a can of chef boyardee looks more appetizing. I was glad the restaurant tanked, that louis prima didnt show up. The "big night" turned out to be a tiny blip of a movie 
 My name is Professor Yoshihiro Hoshi. After 18 years practice as a sexual therapist for me came a great moment. It all began in 1984 with the pop up on the world's market of Mantak Chia's "Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy". This was his first quite good book which teaches how to circulate and cultivate your sexual energy for mental and spiritual development. A key point in it is to contract the so called PC muscle. This is necessary to guide the energy towards the spinal cord. This book has never been popular. However, in 1997 appeared a twist of this book namely "The Multi-Orgasmic Man". The difference between these two books is very small.   Barbara Keesling a philosophy doctor in Psychology followed suit in 1994 and published similar book: "How to make love all night". Once again at the spotlight is the PC muscle. She also insists that its contractions (the trivial start-stop technique) can give you multi-orgasms. Since 1984 and especially in the last 8 years these two books didn't have an alternative.  That's why neither I nor any of my colleagues said anything against them.   For my great happiness this was changed recently. It was Dr. Mitzumoto from Tokyo who was the first one to spot a major breakthrough in the Sexuality filed- the emerge of "Scientifically guaranteed male multi-orgasms and ultimate sex" by A. Ritz. I want on my own to support his support for this outstanding book and state that Mantak Chia and Barbara Keesling's techniques for (ab)using the PC muscle should be replaced by contractions of "The VIP Muscle".   It does NOT take months of exercising and strengthening it as in the case of Chia and Keesling's techniques. I will be surprised if anyone needs more than 15 seconds to find it and up to 3 days to prepare his body to get the maximum out of it. This "VIP muscle" is the REAL and ONLY possible orgasms generator in the male body! The PC muscle is used only to hold your urine and execute an ejaculation.    Hyper-activation of the PC muscle which occurs from "exercising" it leads to premature ejaculations as Ritz proves with thorough biochemical and anatomical evidences. The reason is its direct connection with the Sympathetic nervous system which manages the ejaculation process. On the contrary, The VIP Muscle is connected with the Parasympathetic nervous system which pacifies and nurtures the body. That's why the only muscle a man should use for multi-orgasms and ejaculation control is The VIP Muscle. Chia and Keesling's abusive techniques for the PC muscle can and should finally become history. 
 I have to wonder if the folks who wrote the first reviews read the same text that I did!  This was my basic text for an intro. theology course I took at Princeton, where Dr. Migliore was teaching.  He is classically trained, very disiplined, and a real gentleman. But, as this book demonstrates, he can't be termed a great theologian. While he claims to be a Barthian, and he does use Barth's categories, he would not be recognized as such by Barth.  He might be described as more a "string of pearls" thinker -- he takes things he likes from a variety of contradictory sources, with no apparent anchor or controling principle. What you get is more of a "mood" than a tangible response to God's voice in Scripture.  This is a very weak, very inconsistent, very frustrating work. I hardly ever score things poorly on Amazon, but I had to comment on this when I saw the other glowing reviews. There are all kinds of good theology texts, both to the "left" and to the "right" of Migliore.  Louis Berkof, for example, is a classic that is clear and helpful 
 I used the book Exploring InDesign CS for a Desktop Publishing class, where I was taking it as an independent study.  First of all, this is my second copy of the book, and the pages are literally falling out of it.  I have had to clip the pages together in order to keep the pages from being misplaced.    Secondly, the book has some issues as far as the projects are concerned.  Each chapter leads you through an assigment, and then there are projects at the end of each chapter.  It seems, many times, the author adds things to the projects that have not been practiced in the chapter.  It was extremely frustrating.  Some of the assignments are flawed, and cannot be completed according to her specifications.   It also would have been helpful if she had more pictures relating to the specific activities and assignments.  Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 This CD is 100% pure junk! The CD is sung by KIDS! They have high-pitched voices that aren't even good enough to win the school talent show. The other singers are ADULTS who have voices that aren't anything impressive, either. If the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better.  Stop this s****y music! 
 I really liked Dr. Wayne dyers 101 ways CD but this CD collection is out of focus. After spending 6 hours on this CD , I could not figure out his message !!..  It seems Dr. Wayne forgot that readers/listeners should get some advise when they hear this. He gave many examples and cases but some of them are really weak examples and weird and not upto his point at all.  Dr.Wayne , We love your CD's but this collection is waste of money..   
 This book is merely a propaganda sheet for Miller Newton's (now closed)teen drug "treatment" program, Straight, Inc.   He has NO experience or knowledge of drug treatment methods, and was found to have overseen and participated in child abuse in numerous court cases.  The man is a quack, and anyone with any sense at all should be able to see through the sheer B.S. that he spouts.  He received his "degree" from an unacredited, mail-order diploma mill, and has been successfully sued by many former clients for millions of dollars.  In a recent hearing in Madeira Beach, Fl, he openly admitted that he has NO qualifications to treat anyone, much less adolescents, for a drug problem.  His methods are more dangerous than drug use, and many survivors (THE SUICIDE RATE AMONG HIS FORMER CLIENTS IS  HIGH) claim that they were abused at his hands, and that his "treatment" methods left them with numerous other problems, including Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  The man is dangerous and no one should follow his advice or leave their children in his care.  The book is filled with misconceptions, deceptions, and outright LIES.  
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 The author is reusing a similar plot device than in "Twisted":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes. The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.  A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:  ("favilla", "favillitos"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional. In sum, a book carelessly executed 
 Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library 
 The following is my opinion: As a physician myself about to start my own private practice, I came across this book and thought "well, it's only ~$13 and I'm sure it is worth at least that much and I'm sure I'll get at least one or two pointers." I was wrong on all accounts. Let me save you some time by giving you the answers he offers to his two questions: 1)why most medical practices don't work, 2)what to do about it. Answers: 1)because physicians don't have a system,  2)create a system. Makes promises and keep them.  That's it. If at this point you are saying to yourself "that's it? You have to be kidding!", then you know exactly how I felt after reading the book. Through most of the book, he would bring up provacative questions and I kept thinking to myself "here it comes, I wonder what his answer/solution to that question is,I can't wait, that is such a good questions." And time after time and for the entire book, it left me disappointed. He provided no real answers, or answers that only a child or a moderately mentally challenged adult may take as plausible.  It is like being promised a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and then finding it filled with a pot of manure. He often makes very strange comments. The one that comes to mind right now is: doctors don't understand time with a capital T, they understand time with a lower case t. When I came across comments like this, I was waiting for something profound to be said, which of course left me disappointed and wondering "what the heck was he talking about?" He would tell stories of how patients hated waiting for long periods and that resulted in patients feeling frustrated. Duh! He speaks as if doctors like their patients to be irritated and as if doctors enjoy running late for appointments. His solution to this problem? Stop it, stop being late! and promise patients you will see them on time and keep your promise. You heard me, that is his real solution! He tells a story of a doctor he knows who adopted this philosophy and promised his patients that they will be seen on time or else they do not pay!! I would love to meet this doctor, wouldn't you? He didn't comment on this particular doctor any further. Why do I get the feeling there was much more to that story that is being left out? What made me realize he has no idea about the medical profession is the following: he feels and states that physicians can predict how much time is needed with each patient and that if doctors apply this, that they would never run late. He states that physician don't have to estimate how much time each patient needs but that they can exactly predict how much time is needed. Too bad he didn't share his secret of how to do that, I would paid him big bucks to learn that secret. He would give extremely unpractical advice for physician how to make sure patients do not become dissatified, for example: to always listen to the patient and never interrupt them and always let them say what they need to say. For those of you who are doctors, I'm sure you got a big chuckle reading that just as I did when I read it in his book. In summary, his books has many intriquing questions, no answers which are practical. In my opinion, when I read the negative evaluations of this book on amazon, I thought "well, cheap book, sure I'll get something out of it, maybe those negative ratings are exaggerated." In my opinion, book is less than mediocre and the negative ratings are exactly on target. I rec if you have to check out the book, go to the bookstore and skim it for 10minutes, trust me, you won't buy it 
 WARNING!!! I do love the show and its well worth buying, but be sure you are buying this at the right price! It seems that Amazon has placed a price on the complete series set at $818.99 Well what any smart shopper will notice that seperatly five of the single season sets go for $55.99 and season three and four going for $62.99 These can all be purchased seperatly here on Amazon for these prices. Figuring this out in a calculator shows that by buying the seasons seperatly you will spend around $406. How nice of amazon to package the whole thing together for us then double the price!!! Be careful, there are several of these "package deals" on Amazon 
 The only swindle here is this movie. It is a farce and a lie and a slap in the face of the legacy of the Sex Pistols. And even as a piece of fictional filmaking, it's just not that good. As others have noted, the period clips of Pistols and solo Sid Vicious performances are the only redeeming feature. But the "story" as such is lacking in so many ways; the acting and script are hilariously bad and the film transfer is simply atrocious. Buy it if you will ( on sale or used if you can ) but please don't take it seriously. 
 Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.    Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting 
 I feel sorry for the author. I do not know enough about the industry to know if this is very bad writing or catastrophically bad editing, but under all this lies quite an interesting book.  As others have pointed out the book starts with frequent editing errors, where the spacing is wrong (somewhat lik ethis). This happens every other page for about the first 25 pages, but then seems to stop.  Even worse are smaller, stranger errors that remind me of my student papers before I reviewed them.  For example in discussing John Law he makes a very interesting introduction, until he mistakenly refers to him at one point in the text as William Law (he had discussed a William Peterson right before). I find this sort of error inexcusable in a published book, and once I lose respect for the work it becomes truly hard to enjoy it.   I also believe this form of mistake has motivated most of the bad reviews, even those which mention flaws in economic theory.  For example one reviewer critiqued the comparative advantage example (I presume it is the one where two men work in a deserted island); it is indeed very poorly phrased, but it is an example of comparative advantage. However, after all the previous mistakes who cares to read carefully that which was not written carefully 
 There are many pages that are just completely wasted. 
 I have been a Neil Young fan for decades.  Like many others my age, I cut my teeth on his music, followed him into his electric phase, and bought and learned to play just about everything he recorded.    This album is tired.  Its the same old licks you've heard before and, whether you agree with his politics or not, his lyrics just don't have the sharp edge that they once did.  He has written so many compelling songs with strong social or political messages in his time (Ohio, Zuma, Rockin' in the Free World).  He stands in a small group of musicians that can claim to be among the most influential of our time.    So, given that I think so highly of him, let me say that I wish he hadn't recorded this album and I am sorry I bought it.  
 NOT like "Q" in James Bond.  This book is about empire-building, politics, the "Potomac shuffle game" and wasting taxpayer money.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 I think this book is largely bogus. Sure there is logic in having an efficient system to your manufacturing process and in buying the machines you actually need instead of something too big or too inflexible. But while the Japanese may have ninjas and 'Asian sexual secrets,' they haven't discovered any new principles of manufacturing that we insecure Americans didn't already know a long time ago. Despite the stylish Japanese mumbo-jumbo, there isn't much in this 'lean thinking' that Henry Ford didn't already have figured out by 1914, although the limitations of the technology of that day prevented him from implementing his ideas fully.  Speaking of Henry Ford, among the historical inaccuracies in this book is the oft-repeated untruth that all the millions of Ford Model T cars produced over 19 years were all exactly alike. The truth is that several body styles, ranging from open touring cars to 'Torpedo Roadsters' to closed sedans were produced, and the entire line went through at least two major styling changes and thousands of mechanical improvements.  Some parts of this book just don't make any sense at all, revealing amazingly poor writing on the part of the authors and -- given that this is the revised edition -- an astonishing lack of critical thinking on the part of eager readers. For example, on page 178 it is told how Pratt & Whitney replaced a particularly inefficient turbine blade grinding machine with 'eight simple three-axis grinding machines.' But in the very next paragraph they mention 'each of the nine machines,' and then go on to say, 'The number of parts in the process would fall from about 1,640 to 15 (one in each machine plus one waiting to start and one blade just completed).' Then to top it off, the text is accompanied by a diagram showing a grinding process with eight grinders and two EDM machines. I can see I'm not the only one who flunked math here.  Additionally, the book is full of stories of Japanese lean thinking gurus walking into American factories without advance notice and ordering that all the production machinery be uprooted and repositioned -- immediately. Supposedly, this is done and things brought up to running condition again in six or eight hours, with greatly improved efficiency. Where I come from, we have bothersome things like OSHA rules and the National Electrical Code that prevent us from just sliding around 100 ton presses and precision-levelled CNC machine tools like so many couches and chairs.  Also telling is the example the authors themselves picked to illustrate their concept of 'flow.' One of them asked his daughters, aged six and nine, what would be the best way to fold, address, seal, stamp and mail the monthly issue of their mother's newsletter. The girls naturally replied that you ought to concentrate on one task at a time, and process all the newsletters up to that point before moving on to the next step. But the authors assert that this is wrong, and that this type of work can be done more efficiently by carrying one workpiece through to completion before starting on the next workpiece. Aside from the cruelty of forcing his daughters to walk out to the mailbox and back 547 times, I can tell you from long experience that this is 100% pure BS. Flow is great, as Henry Ford used flow. But to make a blanket statement that it is better to keep one workpiece in hand and pick up ten tools, than it is to keep one tool in hand and pick up ten workpieces, is just plain wrong. It is the tool that requires technique and concentration and uniformity of use, not the workpiece. By spotlighting this ill-chosen example, the authors have revealed in their own introduction a total lack of real-world experience and a disdain for common sense that runs throughout the entire book. 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 This book is a mediocre source for preparing for the PMP. It contains too many errors, inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test. if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book 
 I was very surprised to learn that Dr. Glenmullen has such impressive credentials since his book is complete nonsense. SSRIs are the single most brilliant discovery of the past decades. In every country where they are widely prescribed suicide rates have plummeted. Most studies suggest that more than 2/3 of patients taking SSRIs see improvement within 6 weeks. What once was an incurable disease is now treatable. Dr. Glenmullen should look past trivial and anomalous detail and examine the bigger picture. I am not saying that you shouldn't buy this book. Indeed, it is always advisable to look at other points of view. However, make sure you read this knowing that this author's point of view is completely wrong 
 All the TV shows he mentioned were from around 1990, so I didn't have a clue what's he's talking about. If you wanna read a good nature book, then read Walden by Thoreau 
 The extreme reviews here are very misleading; people either say it's the worst film ever made or Godard's best film. Don't believe either camp. If you're not an expert on Godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema, I could definitely see a person writing off this movie as "sheer pretentious crap", but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance. On the other hand, those who say this is Godard's finest work must be riding high on acid and Marxism themselves. The truth of the matter is that "Weekend", like every one of Godard's post-Anna Karina films, is more a flawed experiment than anything else: On occasion, interesting and thought-provoking, but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them. I respect Godard's attempt to create a new cinema built on "ideas" rather than "emotion", but in my opinion, he went too far in this direction. A piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and don't we have enough of that in our crude, consumerist society? And as far as experiments go, much of what he was doing in "Weekend", he had already done and with vastly better results in  "Pierrot le Fou". That film was a perfect balance between Godard the political-scientist and Godard the post-modern film-maker. Plus, "Pierrot le Fou" benefited by having Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. They brought heart and humor to Godard's abstract explosion of ideas; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor(s) that he never achieved again. "Weekend" starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam, leading to a car-crash...but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space. You really wish Belmondo and Karina would pop in and show the cast they don't have to be mere nails to Godard's hammer. 
 This was one of our main texts for a class on the Ancient Rome I just took this semester. The information in here is solid, but in many (most) parts of the book I was bored to tears...something I've rarely said about any history book. A very dry read. Truely devoted students of Ancient Rome or Classics may find this book useful, casual readers or general history buffs I suggest look elsewhere 
 I was very disappointed with this CD and find the choice of songs and orchestration very self indulgent. The musical arrangements are over the top attempting to be some sort of jazzy cool while only being boring. Please stick to show tunes Betty as this is not entertaining at al 
 One day, accountants and soldiers may take an interest in differential geometry. If and when such a day comes to pass, this book will have a role to play. Until then, engineers, physicists and mathematicians alike have better alternatives, such as the inspiring texts, with complementary qualities, by Burke, "Applied Differential Geometry"; by do Carmo, "Riemannian Geometry", or by Spivak, "A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry".  Even more advanced books such as Lang's or Petersen's are more readable: in them the extra formalism brings the reward of more powerful results. Here the retentive attention to the trees at the expense of the forest is merely a barrier to entry for the uninitiated. This text's popularity in some areas of engineering must have played a role in the slow acceptance of Riemannian geometric methods.  Manuel Tenid 
 Who ripped off who? Emma or Clueless?  The entire time I'm watching this movie I'm wondering when Alicia Silverstone is going to pop up.  I keep thinking "there's got to be something different coming up" but no... it was pretty much the same exact plotline.  I love Gwyneth - but I was not impressed with Emma 
  You people are all idiots, you burn loving a disgusting nation into innocent children's heads who know nothing better.  Go see the innocent bodies strewn across the floor in foreign lands due to America and tell your children to bless America in their prayers.  To hell with you all 
 I can't stand Adam Sandler's movies but his albums have always been consistently funny.  This is the most inconsistently funny album he's ever produced.  A few of the laugh out loud skits include "Gay Robot", "Sid and Alex" and "Calling Home"; the charcters in the latter skit seem to be all played by Sandler and his voices and lines are gut-bustingly funny.  And "Gay Robot" is just plain hilarious.  Of course, this has its fair share of singing from Sandler and "Secret" is, by far, the funniest.  Unfortunately, most of the rest of these skits are so tired and boring that you have to wonder if Sandler hasn't hit a wall as far as his album creativity goes.  "Wolfman" is SO painfully unfunny that you just end up squirming uncomfortably waiting for something remotely amusing to materialize.  And the Pibb skits, his latest recurring character, are just dumb and flat.  Some skits even reach the realm of irritating such as "Creepin' On The Mayor" which involves a character hiding in a garbage can from people who want to beat him up.  That's it.  Wow, that's funny.   You're better off focusing on just five or six tracks and ditching the rest (Sid and Alex, Gay Robot, Secret, Boss and the Secretary, Mule Session, Newlyweds-Sleepyheads, and Calling Home should do it for you).  Oh, and a quick response to all of the people who are obsessed with this album being "dirty".  Have you people been asleep for the past 13 years??  That's what makes a Sandler album is his filthy and lewd talk!  Sandler's funniest bits are the dirty ones and it's always been that way 
 Listening to this, I truly realized that Sedaka made his greatest contributions to pop music in the '50's and '60's. Aside from the few hits (Laughter in the Rain, Bad Blood, Lonely Nights, etc.) he produced in the '70's, Sedaka's M.O.R. "Second career" mainly produced songs for the Geritol set. Buy yourself a good early Sedaka compilation (Sings the Hits comes to mind) and give this one to your grandparents. 
 The only good thing in this movie is Jolene Blalock as a femme fetale. The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.  Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows 
 i wonder how hard it is to write cover letters when you have the exact qualifications the job is looking for?  well, if you want that question answered go pick up a copy of this book.  the best has to be "chloe jones" on pgs 69-71.  she's looking for a job as a grant administrator.  it's amazing!  her past job was exactly that - a grants admin.  imagine how difficult it must have been to write that cover letter and resume!  the book is full of examples like this, where the person has the exact qualifications for the job.  ryan then uses the all powerful "impact technique", to craft a masterful cover letter.  it's a little suspicious when every cover letter begins with "ten of banking experience", "fifteen years of human resources management", "twelve years of marketing skills", etc. there is hardly anything of substance in this book for people wanting to change careers, people with little work experience trying to break into a desired field, or anyone who does not have the exact job history and skill qualifications for the advertised position.  save your money or else you'll spend "two hours of life wasted" 
 I would never recommend this book to anyone who takes the Animee/Manga world seriously. This book is a joke. How can I possibly learn to draw these objects with such a confusing format?  If you buy this book you will be sorry. This book is a disgrace to the art of Anime/Manga cartooning.  
 This book was really dumb. I did not like it at all. It was just soo sooo boring. I thought it [stunk] 
 I thought this book was TERRIBLE, not only the subject matter but it was BORING nothing original. I really threw it in the trash I was going to give it away but with the way the world is now I thought best to get rid of it for good 
 I prefer Fiber Optics Communications by Gerard Lachs.  Unfortunately that book is from 1998, so it is kind of old.  With that said this book seems as if it is written as a list of formulas and references for someone who is already well versed in the topic 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 I read this book desperate for ideas on how to deal with night wakings, and I did not find it helpful. The information is very general and is presented in a disorganized fashion. I had to look in 5 different sections  to answer my question, and each only contained short blurbs on the subject.  Almost every page of this book has a box with a tip or answered question,  and although the advice seems sound, the format is distracting and  difficult to follow. I much preferred Ferber's "Solve Your Child's  Sleep Problems". His answers were more concrete and arranged in a  readable fashion. He provided detailed charts to help you manage things  like how long to let a baby cry, how to water down bottles for night  feedings, or change the sleep cycle of an early riser. I also preferred  Weissbluth's "Health Sleep Habits, Happy Child", which offered a  lot of moral support on why it's best for your child to correct sleep  problems early. He also spends a lot of time talking about daytime naps in  detail. And both authors say it's fine to nurse a baby to sleep (as long as  there are no other sleep problems), which for some reason the AAP is  totally against. I would not recommedn this book 
 A rehash of lateral thinking, in particular the idea of a 'provocation'. Johansson's stories are fun. de Bono got there first 
 This book ostensibly focuses on "emerging methods and approaches that are loosely described as Agile and shows how to apply them effectively...." Topics covered include Agile Modeling, Extreme Programming, Feature Driven Development, Agile Methods with RUP and PRINCE2. The author's a Brit (hence the reference to PRINCE2, pretty much unknown outside the UK). There's an overwhelming emphasis on Agile Modeling and XP and, although the books introduction states that it "....brings together a range of the most popular Agile Methods," Scrum, probably the second most popular Agile approach along with XP, receives only around one page and half a dozen cursory references.  While the author emphasizes XP heavily, there is very little attempt to examine the limitations of XP. The coverage of Agile Modeling is pretty lightweight and it's not really a "how to effectiely use Agile" book either. Overall, my assessment is this is pretty lightweight, not especially usefuland there's better books out there that focus on how to introduce and use Agile effectively. There's also better "overview" books out there with a more inclusive coverage of Agile Processes and Approaches for those who want an introduction. And for non-UK reader, the PRINCE2 coverage is pretty much irrelevant.   Not worth your time. Wasn't worth mine either but I'd already spent it so I thought the least I could do is spare others the pain. Sorry John. Better luck with the next one 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
  There was a mix-up in shipping time and it took longer than expexted. The communication from seller was pretty much non-existant but Amazon did a great job in handling the situation. And, I want to thank Amazon.com for all the help 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 For the Wall Street Journal reading, Heineken drinking, Yuppie set this may be a fascinating journey through all the dive bars that a real beer aficionado would try to avoid. Except for a brief visit to the pacific northwest, the author manages to steer clear all of the places where a vibrant beer scene exists, opting instead to seek out every southern dive bar with an ICE COLD BEER sign. I found the self-appointed beer experts that the author rubbed elbows with, to be trite and pretentious. For the dilettantes this is an excellent rambling unorganized pilgrimage through the backdoors of the corporate beer world, as well as Graceland, Hannibal, MO, and Hooters (Where were Busch Gardens and Disney Land?). For the active or aspiring zymurgist this book will drag you kicking and screaming through swinging doors, where you will find all the opinionated drunkards and self-proclaimed homebrewing gurus you can stomach, telling banal stories about the origin of the IPA style. Take all the time you would waste reading this and cook up a batch to enjoy while reading something worthwhile. As an afterthought this edition was also riddled with typos, and word choices like "scrum" 
 Why Warner Bros? You can't possibly need the money. Why bring this franchise back to life if you're not planning on giving it the justice it deserves?!? I knew the moment I saw the cover that this film wouldn't be worthy of the prior 2 installments, but decided to give it a chance anyway. Big mistake, absolutely nothing about this film works. You get a bunch of horrible stories that are supposed to be intertwined but wind up being nothing but a big train wreck instead. The stories themselves don't make any sense in the first place. They just leave you baffled in the end; & not in a good mysterious way, just WTF? For example, the first story involves a girl & her family. The father has just gotten some new universal remote that whenever he press's buttons the family (all except for the girl) change nationalities. Whenever this happens a chunk of the girl's body becomes all grossly disfigured & mutated. The movie never explains why or where (well I guess later in the movie it kinda explains where, kinda) the father got the remote, why the remote did what it did, or why the girl wasn't affected? This may not seem like a big deal, but once you watch the movie believe me it does, & the whole movie is like that. It's nothing but a bunch of inconsistent amateurish plotlines all mashed together to form one big horrible movie. Another thing about the movie is that it draaaaaaaaaaaaags on. Not necessarily due to the subject matter, but instead the pacing. You can tell this director is pure amateur hour. There's one scene in particular that comes to mind involving this lame mad scientists zany prank flashbacks. This scene went on, & on, & on, & on, just absolutely forever. Stuff like that plagues the movie from beginning to end. Anyway, nothing about the movie works, the acting is horrendous, bad effects (a combo of cartoony CGI & what looks like bright red watery corn syrup), & the story as I said before is lame; there's just nothing good to say about the movie. In addition, the gypsy with the crystal ball you see on the fancy drawn up cover, doesn't show up until the very, very, very end right before the credits role having absolutely nothing to do with the movie what so ever. This is not an homage, but rather a complete insult to all the original greats involved such as King, Romero & Savini. Stay away from this garbage at all costs 
 This shaker has what's probably the worst design flaw that a shaker could have--it leaks.  The lid fits into the cup, and does not form a tight seal.  The two stars it gets are purely for form, I'd give it zero stars for function 
 I am sure there is a lesson in my experience.  I fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the  salt/pepper did not go where I wanted it.  I also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder I had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad I finally threw them away.  Based on a salesmans advise I purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube.  I am sad to say that I again found it's performance to be a big disappointment 
 'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.  Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.  Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first 
 and I think the god must be crazy with a crappy music quality like this! she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years?  PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!   Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one! 
 I am not sure why my school chose this book/ Author. I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys using this book. I give it 2 stars only because it has all the NANDA dx in it (if you can find them!)I find it very time consuming. If you enjoy flipping back and forth to several pages without much help in finding what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. Index aside, this book needs to be more user friendly. I simply do not like the way it is organized. Risk Factors are seperate from Nursing DX, but stuck in the middle of the book, good luck following from one section to another! There is no friendly flow in this book to use it efficiently. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. There has got to be a better way to write this book 
 I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again 
 The author deals not only with the concept of  Christian Heaven, but some other religions as  well.  This would be a good book for someone who'se doing a study of beliefs of different  religious groups on the subject of  Heaven. Un- fortunately, that is not what I was looking for. The book is  well written, but as far as I could tell as I tried to drag through all the  psychology, it wasn't what I was expecting. Joseph Stowell's  "eternity" is still my favorite. It deals much  more on the  spiritual level on the subject of Heaven. I'm not willing to completely  give up on finishing this book, but it's not one you read in one sitting 
 This book was very disappointing.  Every chapter seems to constantly review the negative people and situations that "women constantly think of" giving examples.  On and on with all the negativity, it was depressing.  The advice given was what any friend could tell you.  There is no new advice, just seems to be a review of everyone's problems and to "do something else", so you don't think about it. I was bored and disappointed, the worst book I've read in a long time. Made me think too much about what a waste of money it was 
 I think this book marginalized and almost ignored the most important case in human rights and human rights violations. Where is the Israeli-Palestinians case and why it's missing from Mr. Schulz book, is it because it will show the obvious contradiction between what USA says and what it actually do. What happens when the interests of the United States collides with the human rights. These question and many others needs answers in order to support the arguments made by the author 
 Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil "Red Man" She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended 
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 Do the research on the organization behind this book.  The American Association of University Women is essentially a left-wing front for extremist views about men and women.  They are a propaganga led,feminist group mascarading as an acedemic and research organization.  The saddest part of this book that is based on anecdotal evidence and "studies" largely funded by leftist and tax-payer funded grants into the "female studies departments"  in universities.  The evidence is overwhelming in the ways that schools are failing boys.  70% of honor role graduates were female in 2004.  60% of college bound graduates were female.  SO if you want to waste your time reading a politically motivated, pack of misrepresentation of facts and biased studies, then definitely get this book 
 In follow up to my skeptical, first review of Mr Peterson's "Gray Doom", I researched the total population numbers. Here are the facts. According to the US Census Bureau, in 1999 the median age is 35.5 and the  mean age is 36.4.  In 2030, when the "Peterson crisis" hits, the  median age will be 38.5 and the mean age will be 39.9.  Yes, our total  population will be older but I have a hard time getting too alarmed over 3  years.  In fact, if wisdom comes with age, maybe our "older"  society will be better.  I think Mr. Peterson should present all the facts  and stop trying to alarm us needlessly.  By the way, is he a Democrat 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 All you have to know about this woman is that NAMBLA (The Man Boy Rape, I mean "Love," Association) is a big supporter of hers.  I spit on the ignorant and spiritually bankrupt people that buy into her specious arguments, and I pity their victims 
 This may be the best book about python yet, but it is very annoying to read because it is rife with repetitions of previously stated information.  Every time a particular incident is mentioned (for example: when Terry  Gilliam and John Cleese met during a photo session for HELP magazine), the  author goes back and retells the entire story and its events before adding  the new bit of information that he could just have easily mentioned the  first time around.  This doesn't just happen in two's though.   He retells  stories sometimes as many as ten times!  Also, when an incident is spoken  of by more than one person, each of their comments are reproduced, even if  they aren't much different than the other person's version.  Then two  chapters later, another person may talk about the same event, again, not  adding anything to the story!  I just wanted to scream "I just read  about that! STOP WASTING MY TIME!"  I think he may have felt it was  necessary to put stories in proper historical context, but that would have  served better by creating a chart of significant events and dates for us to  refer to if we weren't too sure about when they happened.  I'm enjoying it  otherwise, but mostly due to the brilliance of the pythons themselves,  rather than the skill of the author, who is very disorganized and writes  with supprisingly little humor or cleverness.  I recently read a book about  the making of SCTV by one of the cast members, and that one was brilliantly  funny, inciteful, and far more eyeopening than this book 
 I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The "cheese" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware 
 I bought and read this book years ago.  At the time,  the Diamonds seemed to make a good case for their viewpoint.  After researching their claims over the years,  I have discovered that most of what they claim is pure fiction and has no basis in the real world.  They seem to know enough about their subject to be dangerous but not enough to actually offer sound advice.  Take what they say with a grain of salt and research their claims before putting any of it into practice.  
 Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame....  
 First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.   The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.   She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.   Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much "living through others" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.  The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.  Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:  cf.en.cl  In conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution. One could call it propaganda.  - 22yo housewife and part-time science/engineering majo 
 The little metal balls and the tips of the colored pieces have all turned color (black spots). It feels gross!! I hope it doesn't have lead in it.   
 What a disappointment!  It is only lacking cartoon illustrations to make it seem competely childish.  But more disturbingly it is deceptively simplistic.  Told through rose-colored glasses, leaving out what is convenient to ensure a "happy" ending. Save your money, wait for it on Vue-Master 
 Ok, I was hasty in this purchase.  At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered.  You see, the dimensions listed under "more details" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  Turns out, not only do you have to click "more details," (fine print) you also have to click "more technical details." (finer print)  Wish I had now.  Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2.  So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed 
 Pretentious and sloppy, filled with mistakes and repetitions. See the AMS review on-line for some details.  Terrible. And shame on S. Pinker and B. Greene for their glowing cover reviews. Were they swayed by the adoring references to them in the text 
 I ordered two of these and returned them the day they arrived.  If you are ordering this product make sure you know what you are getting.  This is an "MP3" player, not an MP3 player.  It doesn't play real music.  You can organize 100 songs that are preloaded onto the music player to make play lists.  I should have known it was too good to be true with the price.  Cute for a toddler who isn't yet interested in "real" music 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 This CD is a good mix of the great ladies of jazz; however the master is the original, without any ounce of technology. I have heard new compilations, and they modify the sound, for hearing as new record, not as a phone call.   However, in matters of pleassure there are no limits, and there would be some one who loves it 
 I basically just skimmed the last half of the book as she lost me early on. Too bad. A fascinating subject, just extremely badly written 
 I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  The color didn't take! My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry.  The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair. 
 This camera is a decent enough camera, compact, easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent.  The battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour.  I acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so I never worry about running out of juice.  I have only two complaints really, one minor and one major.   The minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen LCD viewfinder. I find I need to use my reading glasses to see what I'm doing.  The major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the iLink cable (not supplied).  I have never persuaded it to work.  By browsing various camera fora on the web I am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other Sony models.  The computer will recognize the camera in USB mode (for capturing still pictures from the memory stick) but does not see it at all when plugged in via iLink (firewire/IEEE 1394).  All indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly OK.  Sony tech support, both web chat based and phone, have no clue and because I am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it.     If all you want to do is connect the camera to your TV to playback the video you take, it's a good camera.  If video capture an editing is what you have in mind, buyer beware. Because of this, I can only give the product 2 stars, other wise it would be a 5.  Update:  I installed a new Firewire PCI card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again.  I also tried the camera on my neighbor's Mac (on the theory that if a Mac won't recognize it you really know you have a problem).  The computer still won't recognize the camera.  This camera has been used very little and definitely not abused.  It was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem.  If you buy this, make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it.  Don't wait like I did because I'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed 
 Most of the text is war stories meant to glorify the author. He has no experience at selling outside the field of real estate. Because of that this book has little of interest to those not in that field...and not that  much for those in it. If you sell real estate there are far better books  out there for you on how to build your business. If you sell something  other than real estate this book is of very little use. Mr. Hopkins primary  talent seems to be that of promoting...primarily himself. It may well be  that his blend of self promotion played well in selling real estate years  ago, but he is not a student of selling and is not in touch with the real  world as it now exists. There are much better books out there on  prospecting 
 I returned this product as it does not accommodate the outer title insert - only the inner page.  Product recommended for customers who do not wish to keep the outer slipcase cover page 
 It was ok but was not my favorite.. 
 The writing is jagged, superfluous and constantly filled with statements on what the author is intending to say in the book without actually saying it.  This book is boring, hard to get through and organized in a questionable fashion.  Unless you need to read it for a college course I strongly recommend against it.  Frankly I don't understand the other reviews on this page praising the book 
 LeRoy Ladurie's original study (in French) based on inquisitorial records, while marred by numerous mistranslations, misunderstandings and misuse of the sources, nevertheless, had a somewhat magisterial quality about it. It  is charming and well-written. In the hands of an expert, aware of its  limitations, Montaillou has some value; to the layperson: beware. The  translation, moreover, is truly bizzare. Part I is translated fully; Part  II severly abridged. There was no rhyme or reason for this. It is far  better to read the French original. If you're a novice or don't read  French, avoid this book 
 Does anybody really care what the York Dumbell outfit did to exploit weightlifting or that Bobby Boy Puffman was just looking for a tax writeoff for his incredibly successful oil burner business?  I find this book boring and totally irrelevant. Recommend Dick Tylers West Coast Bodybuilding Scene instead of this one 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 I had to buy this book for school,  Its so boring and horrible.  I hate it.  Repetitive and just bad.  I hope teachers stay away from it.  I wish I could give it less than one star 
 The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order.  Amazon had said they would rectify the error, although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle, and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties, and a different strap entirely 
 Some say everybody loves a mystery, but this book wasn't supposed to be one. It struck me as a buffoonish rant by an unbridled ego gone wild. The book's logic was so wildly disconnected as to leave me wondering exactly where the author was ultimately headed. The real mystery was whether or not someone could truly pontificate for two hundred pages without saying something of substance. The problem was that if there was any value in what was being said, it was masterfully disguised in a shroud of name-calling, racism, and non-sequitur. It was a pompous diatribe rooted in such shallow thinking that any reader with a hint of common sense runs aground long before arriving in port - wherever that was supposed to be.  In this work of art, all those who disagree are evil "liberals", even Bush! If the world were truly as black and white as this uneducated and vitriolic assault on the spirit of humanity, it might be a worthwhile read. However, you'd get more out of reading "The Chronicles of Pee Wee Herman". The book's greatest merit would be as a study guide in a seventh grade class on the fallacies of logical thought.  Newscasters are renown for having big voices, huge egos and pretty faces. Deep thought is not normally something associated with these "readers of the wire". This book presents no evidence to the contrary.  If there is to be another effort by Mr. Hayworth, I'd suggest more substance and less simple-minded name calling and chest pounding. If the rest of the world is as dumb as he paints it, we're all in trouble. He reminds me of the under-achieving student in the back of the class throwing tantrums to to call attention to himself. Try studying more and talking less. 
 The photos inside are very nice but it doesn't represent the standart of persian cat. Here in Brazil the Persian cat is very diferent. Persian's face (principally Persian's nose) is much more different than it is showing in this book 
 following in the footsteps of oceans eleven, in one word... horrible.  the plot was really weak, and the ending was completly unexpected, in this case, that was not good.  there was nothing wrong with the actors, they were all good, it is just the plot was horrible. 
 First of all, for the caliber of actors in this movie, they deserved a better script.  Michelle Pfeifer and Peter Gallagher are class acts, but really this movie just did not dig deep enough. I have read all the rave reviews of Claire Danes, as I have read all the raves in the past and I am beside myself. I mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee. If this is her niche, so be it. The premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on. Completely understandable.  Then his annoying sister in law and  her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead. Oh my god, stop the presses. These people had the sensitivity of androids.  It would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house, but then the film would'nt drone on and on,  This is a good film for a rainy day.  But I expected more 
 The format is fine, the rhymes are fun.  Unfortunately it teaches a completely different knot from the one I had in mind when I bought it.  I was disappointed.  I gave it a try anyway, but it didn't work out very well.  The "rabbit ears" knot in the book is supposed to be easier for kids to learn, but my son didn't find it so.  
 Picture me [a male] handing this book to a female employee - with encouragement to read...  of course you can't - and i can't as well  
 This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword 
 Ok i really only liked her singe Unbelivable, My Baby, Thank You, and Instigator was OK. The truth is her voice is pretty bad its a lot like Britney's. Sorry but Kaci can't sin 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 I'm a huge Bone fan, but this prequel was a letdown.  Sniegoski isn't nearly as good a writer as Jeff Smith.  The story is repetitive, the humor falls flat, and the dialogue is terrible.  The talking monkey is particularly annoying, and has about five times as many lines as necessary.  The story doesn't compliment the original series in the way that the excellent Rose series does.  Also, the final third of the book is Riblet, a story about a baby boar who beats up rat cratures.  Riblet is just...bad.  It's drawn by Stan Sakai of Usagi Yojimbo fame, who really can't hold a candle to Jeff Smith for draftsmanship.  Smith's typically excellent artwork in the first part of the book is the best thing about this volume, which is otherwise superfluous 
 I came into purchasing this product with very limited knowledge of wireless internet cards, wireless routers, etc.  I was away on business most of the time, and was using an older laptop to access the wireless hotspots at the various hotels I was staying at.  Here is what I discovered about the card:  * For those of you who, like me at the time, are somewhat lacking technical savvy in the wireless/LAN network field - this product is not going to give you 108Mpbs, unless you happen to be using a Netgear wireless router that is designed to allow such speeds.  Otherwise you will be limited to 54Mbps, which still isn't bad...compared to DSL.  After nearly 4 months of travel, I experienced very little interference with the signal - unless the hotel router was acting screwy.  *  Say you purchase the recommended wireless router for this product - which is exactly what I did - you won't likely find it much different than the usual 54Mbps in your internet routine; unless you are uploading a great deal of information to the internet.  Downloads seem to be unaffected all together.  *  Here's where it gets a little more interesting:  After purchasing the router, I found myself rarely using the card anymore, due to the fact that I recently purchased a new laptop with all of the current advances in wireless technology already built in.  I can use my internal wireless connection to link to the Netgear router, and get an excellent signal throughout my entire house.  I have found no need to reconfigure my internet connection, as I rarely upload files to the internet.  But, if I plug the wireless Netgear adapter in and install it, roughly 80% of the time it will completely crash the computer (resulting in the dreaded "blue screen of death"), which brings up a fatal error that forces me to reboot my computer and lose all previously saved information.  So, all in all, this product seems to work fairly well when being used with other routers.  (I found that the most common router being used at the hotels I stayed at was a standard 54Mbps Linksys.)  I don't recall having any issues.  But, when used with the recommended router, well...maybe it isn't quite as effective as it's being advertised.  I contacted Netgear and addressed this issue with a customer service representative, and was told that there was most likely a "user error" on my part while installing the router and the card.  I'm doubtful this is the case, as I followed all instructions while downloading the software for the card on my new laptop (just to give it a try) and while connecting the router to my main PC.  I only get the blue screen when using both simultaneously...but not when I - a) use the Netgear card with another router model, or b) use my internal wireless capabilities to connect to the Netgear router.  For the amount of money spent, I honestly feel that I should have a product that works at least 99% of the time that it's being used.  Maybe there is some underlying issue that Netgear just hasn't informed me about yet, and the error actually is on my part.  But until the day that they are finally able to point this out to me, I stand by my statement that this is not the best wireless PC card on the market 
 The basis of this book is a (argument), not scientific evidence.  Taking into account all that support this book, give a non-scientific opinion, more (political) in the end.  Walker is another eurocentric apologist who over looks the emperical evidence that ppl like Dr.Diop, Dr.Massey, Dr.Ben, Dr.Clarke etc., have presented, wether the objective was from euro-historians or afri-historians.      In the books that walker tries to refute by the mentioned authors, there is much evidence to support that Africans did indeed influence the Asians and Europeans, and that, Egypt(KMT) was indeed a African civilization, no where, but in Africa do you find those(aboriginals) that directly resemble, in appearance, culture and language, the Egyptian people and system, see: Wolof, Nok, Buganda, Yoruba, etc.  Facts are irrefutable, so, Mr.Walker should reread the books of Dr.Clarke, Diops, Jackson, Dr. Massey, etc., considering if he even read their work.      People tend to support with prejudice what makes them feel good at the end of the day.  Indeed, if Africentricity was a tool to reestablish black pride, then, one wouldnt need to look at ancient societies for a boost, another classic example of how wanna-be authoritarians mismatch information.  Black pride and black history are two different subjects inwhich Mr. Walker purposely doesn't make the distinction between the facts and opinions of himself and others, selective favoritism no doubt.      Mr. Walker is so full of himself, that he would have ppl to believe that colonialism, industrialism, imperialism, fascism,  etc. didnt have a negative effect on under-developing Africa and other europeanized stricken worlds.  This book is another example of european escapism from any wrong doing of others.  Books like these are becoming few and far between, as for all intelligent ppl will perceive facts, rather than believe in opinions.  My assertion(opinion supporting fact) of mainstream eurocentric babble.  p.i       
 This book is sure to please right-wingers who like to denigrate liberals as "elitist'. It does a good job of pointing out (old) issues in which the left did not succeed in all of the goals of liberal programs, without a hint that the things the right-wing was trying did not work either. In Sowells' view, everything was hunky-dory in the 50s, and if only the liberals would have left things alone, poverty would have been eliminated, cars would naturally have become safer, and the God "free-market" would have worked his magic to cure societal ills such as out-of-wedlock births, the plight of black americans, and the AIDS epidemic.   Interestingly, Sowell uses the word 'anointed' a biblical term favored by evangelicals and the current neo-cons in power as they pander to the religious right, to describe a type of liberal he doesn't like. His disregard for the Left ruins any chance that anyone except a right-wing ditto-head will enjoy this book.   Sowell denigrates the Left's use of statistics, just prior to using the same statistics to "prove" his points. "Aha"!   Ignoring the last 12 years or so, Sowell asserts that it is the Left who try to tell people what to do, and use the government to rule people.  Right. And Fox news is fair and balanced.   If you are a right-winger, you will enjoy reading his preaching to the choir of how bad liberals are, and the revelation that their motives (help the poor; seek justice for all Americans; provide for a healthy life...) are really a justification to tell "the benighted" what to do.  If you are a thinking person, you will be mostly  satisfied by everything except Sowell's utter disregard for those who don't agree with him.  For those seeking a balanced look at our societies' problems, how we can solve them, and how we came to be in the current mess, you will have to look elsewhere. Sowell's disdain permeates the book and makes his assumptions (based on the same type of thinking he hates in the Left) not worth trusting.  In short, another attack-book, albeit this time from someone with a brain. 
 The 1999 nominations for the "Grammy" awards compacy disc was extremely dissapointing. The varaity of different types of music made me dislike it. There is a version of the Backstreet Boys "Backstreet's Back" that I've never heard of before. Also they have opera (?) music with Andrea Bocelli. I think that it is great that he a nomination, same with the Dixie Chicks. But country and opera aren't the kind of music that deserve a place on a compact disc that ages 10-15 are the majority of people that buy it. I'd say pop, rock, alternative, and rap are the main choices in music that pre-teens choose. If you like Opera, country, pop, and soft rock, this is the album for you. But if your around 12 and 13 I would not recommend this, so save your money and go buy something else 
 Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!    The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp.  Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!   
 Not sure what is worse, the horrible script or the horrible acting. Typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script. Watching Schneider dress in women's clothes for an entire movie is just creepy. Using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie. 
 Though well written.  Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian.  It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists.  Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god.  Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for.  Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously.  As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer.  Good for him. 
 AWW Garth Nix I'm so disappointed :'( truly, I am. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were such good books but The Ragwitch was really bland. At frist I thought that it'd be really good, despite my friend saying it was going to be rubbish, and then... I read it. I couln't even finish it. I'm really sorry, I wish I didn't have to be such a kill joy but this book is really bad. I'm not going to be sour and give it a 1 but if you've read Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen then you'll know what I mean. If you havn't read thease books, then do so instead of this one because they are a hundered times better 
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 One of these days the YA publishers will stop using actual YA writers for their tomes. Sure, the young adults are the same age as the readers, but that means nothing when character development and insight are sacrificed.  This book is about a nerd creepy loser whose given a nanocomputer to train him to be cool. So he becomes a jackass creepy loser. Most of the supporting characters are types and the non-teenage characters are either boring or ridiculous. There's even some homophobia thrown in as the English teacher swishes every which way saying MAAAAAAAAAA (I'm not sure what that means either).   While the book centers on the narrator's attempt to go out with a girl in his drama club, you never get why he likes her. In fact, she never seems to be a coherent human being. Almost every time she's in the narrative she's doing something off-kilter that makes no sense to anyone. The only reason why you sympathize with her is because she's got to deal with this jerk, and even then you really wish she'd just put a restraining order on him.  While there are moments of insight, where the author and the narrator come up against the fact that they aren't the only people in the world with problems, they are few and far between.  Overall, this is a horrible book with horrible characters and lousy plotting. The only good thing that you can say for the book is that it's not half as irritating as the audio CD 
 I've been cutting myself since I was 14, now I'm 24. I'm currently writing my own book about self-injury and personally I felt this book was boring. I pushed myself to continue to read it and by the end of the book it ended up being just another book on my shelf.  I wouldn't recommend this book to people, self-injurers or non-self-injurers.  I believe the stories that were told within the book had a lot of the same storyline. I would've liked to have read different types of stories. The majority of the stories were about those who were abused. Not every self-injurer was abused. Some just had troubling pasts like myself that weren't able to cope with life.

 John McCutcheon, Happy Adoption Day! (Little, Brown, 1996)  I have to start this review by admitting that I'm not the best sight-reader on the planet. In fact, I'm pretty awful at it. What do you want? I'm a drummer. I not only have a tin ear, I have one that was recycled at a cut-rate plant. So, okay, maybe I'm not qualified to be reviewing this book from a musical perspective. But even a drummer can recognize rhythm-- especially when it goes wrong. And there are some places in this book where it goes horribly, horribly wrong. (My nonmusical wife pointed out some of the same lapses in rhythm I had first wondered about.)  And here I offer the same postulate I have been offering, usually unsuccessfully (no matter how right it may be) for years: how you say something is just as important, if not more, than what you say. The message of the book is all well and good, but present it in a clunky manner, and you're either teaching kids to resent the message overall or to enjoy really substandard music. (Doesn't Radio Disney do enough of that already?) Awkwardly-phrased lyrics: not confined to rap any more. **  
 I would not waste my time with this book.  The author provides you with some home based opportunities but you could find these offers in the back  of any magazine.  At the beginning of the book it states they have  researched the companies but then they go on the say that some offers my  not be current or legitimate 
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.    There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.  There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.    If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.   
 The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a novel writen by Wallace Stegner.  I have heard many great things about Stegner's work, so i picked this up with  much anticipation.  Perhaps his other books are  much better, but this book is not good.  And when  I say that I'm being very gracious.  The story centers around a family of four, Bo,  his wife, Elsa, and their two sons Chester and Bruce. The novel follows them from place to place throughout America, about their poverty, and overall faliure.  The fundamental problem with the book is this:  You're supposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck. But you don't because the author would rather give you  pointless detail (while ignoring important detail) than help you get to know and like the characters.  By the time that their lives are ruined you don't even like any of the  characters.  If the author had spent more time developing a mental relationship between you and this family than the book could pull the right strings.  Then there is also the question of possibility.  Is it really possible for a person (Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutly everything? And pushing it even further is it possible for this person to not be able to make any money what so ever.  In this book It describest this husband as being a great baseball player (yes he's hurt, but why not become a coach or something?), a nearly flawless hunter, and many other things.  Yet he remains broke for thirty years?  Also the seemingly dramatic parts of this book are more funny than dramatic.  Wallace Stegner may have written many other good books. Through his writing i can see some potential.  But in this book his potential even as a good writer only shows when he's "in a groove".  When he's in a groove he seems to have a tallent for writing, but when he's not, his sentences are long and jumbled and often don't even make sense.  If you don't believe me then here is the first sentence of the book just to prove it to you:  "The train was rocking through wide open country before Elsa was able to put off the misery of leaving and reach out for the freedom and release that were hers now."  See what i mean?  I'm sure that a writer such as Dickens or Hemingway never put down a sentence that confusing.  For that sliver of potential i award this book it's one and a half stars, but keep in mind, this may be the worst book i've ever read 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 Eating right and eating 6 times is great but no exercise? Took ideas from well known facts and change some to make no sense. 
 I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD 
 I am a soundtrack fan, love a good soundtrack, and found this to be incoherent...the music sounded stereotypical and unoriginal. I love Lisa Gerard's contributions to the Gladiator soundtrack but here, her voice is lost in the music. I find this cd to be kind of irritating to listen to, rather than beautiful. I'm trading it in at the local used cd store asap 
 When I read the cover of this book, it sounded great.  A suicide mission to Titan to follow up on the  Huygens probe discovery of life on that far away moon.  The first chapter describing the probe's descent and landing was  spectacular.  After that, the story quickly and painfully collapsed.  I did not get far with this tome.  However, I figured out three things.  First, Baxter seems to be quite knowledgeable in the aerospace engineering field and doesnt have the faintest idea how American politics or governmental function.  Finally, the author doesnt know how to create characters.  Mr. Baxter's engineering background could have made this a great book.  Unfortunately, he seems to assume his readers are aerospace engineers!  I found quite a few instances where Baxter refers to items using acronyms and never explains what the acronyms are.  After a few examples of this, I phased out.  The author takes a stab at the American governmental and political system.....and falls flat on his face.  I didnt get that far in the novel so I didnt view the whoppers of mistakes other reviewers cite.  But let me tell you this much.  Even the stauchest of NASA critics dont propose downsizing the outfit and putting it under control of Department of Agriculture!!  Geez, where did that come from??  Finally, character development sucks.  Again, I didnt get too far.  But I read long enough to get a decent picture of two female astronauts (one Chinese and one American) who were thoroughly obnoxious.  There was also the NASA Chief who seemed to have the personality of a glass of lukewarm water.  The only character I found somewhat compelling was Astronaut Lamb, who seemed to mostly lurk in the backgound and look cool.  I truly wish I could have read further to see them get killed off!  It is truly sad.  Baxter seems to be a uniquely gifted person who picked up what could have been a compelling story line.  The guy just needs to learn skills outside of engineering like writing and political science to pull it off 
 and I suspect this is what has happened to James Lee Burke.  The Dave Robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now - and that is tragic, considering the promise of the early books, which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead.  I grew up in southern Louisiana, and Burke captures a culture that many people have no experience of.  But the series is becoming repetitive and stale, culminating in this book, which is just awful.  Burke's characters, with the exception of the always funny and touching Cletus Purcell, are wearing thin and becoming less and less sympathetic.  Dave Robicheaux becomes more priceless and preachy in each novel.  His anti-alcohol tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud.  Burke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again, and it makes the reader wonder if he isn't cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly.  If I read one more time in a Burke book that Leadbelly strung his twelve stringed guitar in octaves, I will be sick (hey, Mr. Burke?  Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way, Leadbelly didn't invent that tuning, okay?)  If I read the word "phallus" in a sex scene in one of Burke's books one more time, I think I will just give up.  The phrases are getting old - really old.  The preaching about political corruption and alcohol got old many books ago.  One thing to be thankful about in this abysmal wreckage of what was once a great series - Bootsie, Dave Robicheaux's wife, is dead, though that doesn't keep her out of the story.  But at least the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death - the moment in every book with Bootsie in it where she gets up in the night, angry with Dave, and goes to sleep on the couch.  I've had bets with other readers as to what page Bootsie will do this inevitable stunt (which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the "phallus" when they kiss and make up) in each Burke novel where she is a character.  Thankfully, also, Alafair, Dave's adopted daughter, is far away at college, and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became tedious in the earlier books and yet another repetition of the story of how Dave came to adopt her, which is included in every book since the introduction of the Alafair character.  It's time for Mr. Burke to let the series go.  It's a travesty of its former self.  Reading this book is like visiting a relative who has lost their mind to dementia - you see a hollow, nearly unrecognizable shell of a formerly vital and beloved person.  It's painful 
 Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose's book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists "who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as "people who either no longer do science or never did it." What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that's about it.  
 Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films?  And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending.  Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!  What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next?  The Scarlet Letter?  
 Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry "It is poetry:thoughts" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry 
 This is the strangest foot stool I have ever seen. It looks like something out of Alice In Wonderland. My toy poodle loves it. The stool is very small and looks very odd in a large room. It does not match any of my chairs in terms of size. My toy poodle fits perfectly inside the compartment. It may fit a few small magazines but nothing more. It is in the shape of a hat box. Not at all what I expected 
 DJ, Producer, Musician, Writer, artist, and Filmmaker(ha) is often called a Renaissance man.  Well Mr. Spooky just because you own final cut pro doesn't make you a filmmaker and just because you own protools does not make you a musician.  This is the worst of Spooky's many failures!  Time to pick a career and devout your life to it instead of all this haphazard look I do everything just not very well nonsense.  If you want to be a musician, be a musician. You can still do those other things, They're called hobbies.  
 I agree with S. Haus.  I was also disappointed.  The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover).  I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home.  Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally 
 I bought this as a Christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter.  She is a huge My Little Pony fan.  Ponyville lives in our house in fact.  We got it out and played with it for a couple hours.  We didn't have the problems described with the hand crank.  That seems to be very durable.  The problem is with the flower that Zippee goes in.  A pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it.    After a couple hours, the flower petals are now broken and can't be repaired.  Toys certainly don't have the quality in them that they used to.  Hasbro's quality in general has declined.  This was demonstrated in the newest My Little Pony Castle as well.  This toy has some neat features.  The crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful.  The Breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the My Little Pony video series.  The colors are vivid and bright.  I would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the Daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories.  Some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set.  4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies' hair is a bit skimpy.  The braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy....with a bit of assistance.  (Hint:  Putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance) 
 I have not even opened this because the first two CDs I ordered from Amazon sounded like they were fake 
 I came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I've suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ).   First let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.  What happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?  Well, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America's military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it's their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.  The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They're frustrated, these authors.  I can't blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You're at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.  
 My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port.  I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC.  If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it.  There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers.  Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed.  I should have researched this before the purchase.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing it. 
 Ok. I am sure the majority of you are more Jamie Oliver fans than wanting to buy his book for the cooking. I really liked watching Jamie in the Naked Chef days...early ones especially so I was given this book from a friend of mine as a pressie. It was very entertaining and I guess his passion just shines through in his books and Naked chef etc... however as lame as it may sound I only recently made a couple of recipes including the 'kinda portuguese custard pie' which I know should taste amazing. I bought the best quality ingredients and even 2 vanilla pods from Sainsburys which cost me 3.99. The custard was way undersweet. Jamie suggested a medium heat to cook the custard and I even put it slightly less because my dad is a head chef and he told me it would turn into scrambled egg consistency and it did. He also said to cut the pastry 1 inch thick and I had a feeling that this would be too thin and indeed it was. I had spent one whole hour just sorting out the pastry only to end up watching it fall to pieces in the oven cos it was melting....I could go on forever but Jamie might be a good cook but do not confuse this with Gordon Ramsey standard of cooking. 
 This is an excelent book I have no doubt, but make sure you order the new version.  The new revised 2005 book is out, this one is the old 2000 book.  
 I purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at Amazon, it looked also like a fun toy with educational value.  I am very disappointed.  For starters, my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes, face & hat can only go on in one order.  He also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together, and he is very dextrous for his age.  Also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in.  Without this, the blocks are loose in my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces.  The packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. All in all, it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance, as I had thought it might be.  When he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else.  We could have done without this toy under our Christmas tree 
 I felt the book had highly unorganized content inside the chapters. The examples were vague and confused me further. It's more like a reference book than the text book which would explain the beginner Palm OS programmer the nuts and bolts of palm OS .I read the online docs for palm os4.0 sdk and found them much more informative than the book 
 Jet lee was dorky in this film, and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad. This film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in America. After seeing the light, Jet returned to Hong Kong and completed the historical Once Upon a Time in China series. The rest is history 
 This was the first Tami Hoag novel for me, and it will be my last. After reading such great reviews I expected more from this veteran author. What promised to be a murder mystery was, in fact, no mystery at all. After the first couple of chapters I had surmised "who done it," and by mid-novel I had wrapped up the rest of the so-called loose ends. This detective story is Mickey Spillane gone very long and very predictable 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 This books was way too overhyped.  Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed.  It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed.  The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong.  A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play "Louie Louie" in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard.  Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else 
 Just not worth it. This author keeps repeating the same formula and it's not working anymore. 
 This book had such great reviews so I decided to try it. What I found was a slow story.  I just didn't care about the characters and I struggled to get through the first 100 pages.  The writing was good, but it did not draw me into the story 
 I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so. 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 This book was terrible.  In the past year I have read over 200 books and this is the worst!!!  The first two chapters were good and had lots of potential, but the rest of the book is psycho!! It changes to the inside of  the main character's mind.  I hoped with every page it would get better, it  didin't.  SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can not  express how bad it is 
 What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?  I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a "couldve been great"..... 
 I began reading this novel with high hopes. I thoroughly enjoyed Rosemary's Baby, and could not wait to read the long-awaited sequel. I read the novel on and off for about a week. The book moved at a sluggish pace and I simply couldn't get into it. By the time I came to the ridiculous ending, I was disgusted. I will not give away the ending, but lets just say it's a major disappointment. Save your money and skip this novel.. 
 This is a rudderless work.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why it's so often performed.  It's as if the work were written on commission. Every single act bears the mark of duty.    James Yanni comes close below when he remarks that "there is little to recommend this play that wouldn't likewise recommend almost any of Shakespeare's comedies."  I think the problem, more precisely, is that the devices used to such wonderful effect in Shakespeare's other comedies -- shipwrecks, twins, transvestitism -- are deployed here to no effect at all.  There is not a single sympathetic character in this play.  Everyone is obsessed with either booze or money.  The fool is more annoying than amusing.  The rushed, climactic scene in which Orsino, having pined for Olivia for five acts, turns his love abruptly to Viola (whom he has never seen outside her male disguise) speaks to how urgently Shakespeare must have wanted to put the finish on this awful mess and bring down the curtain.  For a taste of Shakespeare's comedic power, read -- well, read any other comedy he wrote 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!    Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.  Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.    Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 It is true that when children read a story they find much more than just a plot with a happy ending.  Many fairy tales including "The Princess and the Pea" contain somewhat hidden patriarchal, social, and class ideologies hidden within the texts.  In the story "The Princess and the Pea" the princess is portrayed as an unintelligent woman who cannot find shelter for herself when she is caught outside in a torrential storm.  The king must invite the princess in and give her shelter.  When the queen sees the princess, soaking wet and dirty from the rain, she does not believe that she could be a "real princess."  Does this mean that just because she is dirty and a little ugly she is not really a beautiful princess on the inside?  What is this teaching children?  Maybe children who read this story will not trust unattractive children.  This could have harsh consequences in a society where racism and other cultural biases are already present.  The fact that the queen truly believes that only a real princess will be able to be sensitive enough to feel the peas suggests that middle and lower class girls cannot be as sensitive as upper and high class girls.  There is also a reference in the story of the prince "taking the princess and making her his wife."  This suggests that the princess has no say in the marriage.  She may not even really love this man, and although she sleeps badly for one night because there are a couple of tiny peas in her bed she may sleep badly for a lifetime after being forced to marry a man that she does not love 
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 "A Consumers' Republic" is one of those kinds of books that exists on the premise that it illuminates some previously unknown phenomenon. The book purports to be a "bold, encompassing, and profoundly influential book."  I humbly propose that this book is none of the above. "A Consumers' Republic" is certainly not a "bold" book. Quite tepidly, actually, the author makes a weak case that is essentially a rehashing (and a mediocre one at that) of mainstream academic criticisms of popular market culture. Certianly nothing new, the ideas lamely presented by this author were actually prefigured by a factor of centuries by actual scholars such as Smith, Marx, and de Toqueville. Not bold for sure, but also lacking nuance; "A Consumers' Republic" condescends to its readers and its subjects alike.  And is this book "profoundly influential," as the jacket pompously asserts? I hope not 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 I imagine there are some useful and perhaps even good ideas here. But the entire text is so self-obsessed that it's hard to see beyond the "travelogue" conceit. Franzosi seems to believe that his story-telling makes the book accessible - but instead it simply makes it annoying. Can one meaningfully go from words to numbers? No doubt the answer is yes. But the techniques for doing so will be best served by a more concise elaboration written by someone with less interest in sharing his stories with what Franzosi seems to imagine as an adoring readership. 
 This film just goes to show that when Hollywood wants to make money they turn everyone into a tramp. This happened to all involved in "Friend" (hardly an appropriate title). I only hope the ASPCA stepped in sometime and sued because of animal cruelty and the film's promoting of the perpetuation of cruelty to animals. And I hope writer/director John Lafia is real proud of himself.  He just sent the need for and recognition of animal rights back to the stone age. Only redeming factor was Lance Henriksen's work. He did the best with what he had to work with as usual 
 I didn't realize when I bought this that it is not really an adult-geared book. The stories are very short and written in very elementary terms, apparently targeted at children. Left me wanting more information about the animals 
  'New World Order'?! HUH?!?!  Folks, before you believe what he says in this book, below are excerpts of some things this crazy nut said on January 2nd of this year (2007), which was reported by 'AP':  * God has told him that a terrorist attack on the United States would result in "mass killing" late in 2007.  "I'm not necessarily saying it's going to be nuclear," he said during his news-and-talk television show "The 700 Club" on the Christian Broadcasting Network. "The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that." Robertson said God told him during a recent prayer retreat that major cities and possibly millions of people will be affected by the attack, which should take place sometime after September.  * Robertson suggested in January 2006 that God punished then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon with a stroke for ceding Israeli-controlled land to the Palestinians.  "I have a relatively good track record," he said. "Sometimes I miss." In May, Robertson said God told him that storms and possibly a tsunami were to crash into America's coastline in 2006. Even though the U.S. was not hit with a tsunami, Robertson on Tuesday cited last spring's heavy rains and flooding in New England as partly fulfilling the prediction.  Folks, I rest my case.  
 this is an ok cd, ill listen to it if im bored or something, slayer isnt at all a really good band, but they did something here, they made there music sound ok, slayer is getting stronger.... 
 Let me say right out that Sasha and Digweed are fantastic DJs, each in their own right, and that the Delta Heavy tour was an epic experience.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not pack the expected punch of the actual performance.  Make no mistake, this is NOT a concert footage DVD.  Instead you will find interviews galore detailing the logistics and documenting the events surrounding the Delta Heavy tour.  The music, for the most part, is not even live.  Too much talk, waste of money.  Pick up Sasha's Involver or Digweed's Fabric instead, forget the DVD.    
 If you want the genuine facts about these people you don't need an outsiders opinion. Speak to them! Ask them to prove their beliefs from the scriptures, go to the source! The fact that they take time out to go to the people, as Jesus did, says alot about them. What are all the other professed Christians doing on weekends? I wonder.. 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 Humans are social beings and in general want to agree with  social trends and dogma.When one dominating 'know it all'  'with all the answers' comes along,humans will flock to the  bookstore and obsorb anything out there like a sponge.Sad isn't it.Are we losing our inner being and strength to the point where we have to rely on quirky off the wall 'experts' whom think to know every brain cell we have? I agree with the other one star reviewers.The book is sexist and will cause even more  trouble in male/female relationships.As for bridge brains.The  truth is in a six billion population on this earth we find  indivduals,a lost species,this explains the 'bridge brain'.What the truth is,we all have our own brain,not some pre fab gender specific gray matter forced between our ears by non other  than Micheal Gurian.I also agree with the reviewer who said it's nore than an agenda.I read the book thinking I'm reading  the words of a controll freak bent on causing as much dismay  between the sexes in order to bring up the sales.If I were a  man I'd be insulted by his thinking about men.Simply put,he  wants to make mass sales,make men and women at odds with  each other and have his narrow minded sexist institute controll the educational and relationship so he can believe he's king of this planet.As an individual we have power which people like this try to despertly take from us so they can mass market a  dangerous and damaging lie 
 I have a 4 year old who broke it the first day he had it.  The roll pars broke first, very sharp small pieces.  The Shark head came off after that, I'm simply not impressed with the build quality of this thing.  It should maybe be marketed to adults that will gingerly look at it.  Kids are rough, just ask Tonka.  We have yet to break a Tonka, this thing died the first day.  Do the math 
 I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT. I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT. THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEA 
 I checked this book out from our library to see if it would meet my needs as an in-depth introduction and more to the neurosciences. I have a number of MIT press/Bradford books and expected quite a bit from this one. I was impressed with the breadth and range of topics and the quality of scholarship, but the incredible number of typos, particularly in the second section, left me steamed. Those poor authors who had the spelling of their names butchered in print have my sympathy. These typos include some in the diagrams, which lead to confusion. I expect a better quality of editing from a large professional university press. I bought Principles of Neuroscience (Kandel) instead. My advice would be to check out a copy of the Gazzaniga from your library and go over it to see if it is acceptable to you before you spend [...] on it 
 After Vol.1 I was very disapointed in Vol.2. I expected different songs. 
 If you're trying to instill an appreciation for classical music -- and I can't imagine any other reason to show Peter and the Wolf to kids -- don't buy this version.  The DVD does have background music from the symphony, but the musical aspect is NOT EVEN MENTIONED.  The true test is in its appeal: 3-year-old boy, 5-year-old boy, 9-year-old girl ... all found it boring 
 Like most device drivers the Turtle Beach specific driver needs to be installed with Administrative rights. Nothing unusual.  However, when a Non Administrator logs on (as is good security practice) the driver says is needs to be reinstalled, which is not possible without Administrator rights. Catch-22.  Not usable for me as I don't use the Administrator account except for special purposes, a security "best practice". Without the Turtle Beach specific driver it works as a generic USB sound card with the default Microsoft driver(no reinstallation required!). No special sound effects then, so not worth the extra price premium over a generic USB sound card.   Too bad the poor software implementation ruined a good piece of hardware, as when it works it sounds great 
 As a beginning blogger, I was disappointed with this book.  I generally like the Dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining.  This one is not.  The author is sarcastic -p. 3 "What You're Not to Read - I forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket."  Really!  The information on Blogger doesn't add anything that can't be found on Blogger help screens.  Several blogging services, for example Edublog, are not mentioned at all.  Last, The Part of Tens was not as neat as in most of the Dummies books.  I want my money back 
 This book takes advantage of the fear of being hacked by presenting the reader with a ton of paranoid, poorly written information. So many books before this one have approached network security in a much better manner. I've found so many mistakes in this book, or critical omissions, that I finally stopped reading it 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here 
 Author devotes 2 pages to mathematically prove & philosophically justify that a manager should chose the highest NPV project before chosing the next highest NPV project.  Such logic continues ad infinitum throughout the 800+ page text.  Time for 3rd Ed 
 I received what looked like a nicely preserved used copy.  The book literally fell apart from the binding the first time I read it. It continued to come unglued from the binding each time I attempted to read it.  Not a good quality copy.  Would not purchase from this supplier agai 
 This book failed on a number of levels.   If you are already studying Buddhism, you might find this topic of reconciling worldly desire with "The Path" to be interesting and possibly useful.   While this topic is a good one, this particular book is a flop.       First of all, the message of the book was ambiguous.  But the most interpretation I have of it is this:    Use desire to gain insight; the insight you gain gives you an orgasmic level of bliss, yada yada yada.     This is great - but it's already been said elsewhere!  (and more elegantly!)     This book contained nothing new related to Buddhism, except a sexy repackaging.  The book is completely redundant insofar as learning more about The Practice.   It gives no clear advice on how to further one's practice.  (aside from having Tantric sex with someone (assuming you can find a partner)... in which case there are plenty of other books on that topic. )       If you know very little about Theravada Buddhism, you still might think Epstein's take on desire is interesting.  However, like I said above, you can just read any other book about mindfulness, insight meditation, or Theravada Buddhism, and you will find that material much more clear and useful.  Suggestions to you are "Mindfulness in Plain English" (which you can cut-and-paste for free off the Internet!) and "Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness."     In short, it's an interesting topic but a bad book.  Epstein is vague, rambling, seemingly contradictory, and, if my interpretation is correct, completely redundant.  He does not build on Buddhism, nor does he challenge it:  He simply sexes it up, "eclecticizes" it, and resells it in a diluted and confusing form.  (I think Epstein had good intentions, but I think he was just thinking out loud in this particular book.)         If you think I've missed the point of the book, I would REALLY like to know what I missed.  I had high hopes going in!   What is the thesis?  How does it differ from or improve existing Theravada instruction?  
 I bought these glasses as a Christmas gift.  When the box arrived, let me put it this way, the box was nicknamed the "Jingle Box."  The glasses were in pieces.  The packaging of the glasses was horrible.  There was barely any "cushion", the shipping box was not much bigger than the box for the wine glasses.  The glass was in so many pieces that I wasn't even able to remove the box from the shipping box because there were so many little pieces of glass that had fallen out of the glasses box.  I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement, that got stopped halfway here because the shipper said the glasses were damaged when they left the shipping center.  I called Amazon again and they attempted to send me the item again.  I refused and had to argue with them to get my money back.  On top of that they then tried to charge me for the orginial glasses.  Now, at the same time I bought another set of wine glasses for someone else and those came packaged beatifully and they were in great condition when I got them.  If you are looking for wine glasses that you will receive undamaged purchase the Marquis by Waterford Vintage Aromatic Red Wine Set of Four, they are a beautiful set and won't be broken when they get to you 
 Very good book. It gives us a real idea of what was and is Latin America (since the enviroment is very much dinamic the last/last issues are not incorpoated in the book). Worth 
 In the final act of Gail Godwin's The Good Husband, novelist Hugo Henry compares the process of writing a novel to the progress of marriage.  First comes attraction to the idea, then one must decide whether to continue forward or abandon the story.  Godwin must have seen great promise in this novel's concept, but should have realized it was a fruitless endeavor midway through writing it.  If she had followed her own advice, The Good Husband would not exist only to fail like the marriages it describes.  The Good Husband peers into the lives of two married couples.  The four individuals are brought together by death; the death of a spouse and the death of a newborn.  Throughout the course of the novel we observe these characters tackle various obstacles.  Magda Danvers, an arrogant professor at Aurelia College, struggles through a slow death via cancer while her husband Francis Lake cares for her with unflagging devotion.  Aurelia's writer-in-residence Hugo Henry must cope with both his son's homosexuality and his own failing marriage.  Alice, Hugo's spouse, finds her attention drawn toward both the ailing Magda Danvers and her long dead family, as opposed to her own marriage, in the wake of her first child's death-at-birth.  Throughout the text Godwin alludes to a plethora of scholars and writers, all well researched, to emphasis connections between the four major characters.  An interesting scenario, but one of the key problems with The Good Husband is that these characters, if realistic, are uninteresting and unlikable.  Passages shedding light on the past of Francis the emasculated servant boy do not make for compelling reading.  Hugo the beach novelist (any serious writer would not entitle his novel A Month With the Manigaults and betray the subtlety that makes alliteration work in the first place) is a frustrating little man I attempted to physically beat out of existence by throwing the book against a cinderblock wall.  Perhaps these men are reflections of those in our everyday lives, but the author doesn't do much to make me care about them or even tolerate them.  Godwin writes about as well as I imagine Hugo would; her craft is plagued by graceless description.  I could care less if Francis "wore a clean beige polo shirt."  Is it necessary that Godwin portray "the president's pert-featured wife" as "crisply turned out in mint-green slacks with a matching scoop-neck tee and linen blazer"?  This awkward excess of superficial description without the use of metaphor or simile makes reading The Good Husband a chore.  The glut of adverbs has a similar effect.  By page 240, any reader is well aware of how Leora Harris behaves and interacts with the other characters; we need not be patronized by the use of words such as "pertly" to drive this into our skulls (also note that a variation of this term was used only eight pages ago).  The frequent usage of this, "demurely," and hundreds of other offenders are just as effective as Godwin's bland musings on clothing in hindering the reader's progress.  Adverbs have their place in the English language, but when the author does not trust to reader to infer the climate of dialogue she has insulted her audience's intelligence.  The novel is saved from total disaster by its intriguing premise: the entwined lives of four men and women.  Unfortunately, Godwin doesn't have the tools she needs to weave this tapestry, her ham-fisted writing slowing the pace of the narrative down to a crawl.  The Good Husband will be enjoyed by some, but I will rest easy having finished with Magda Danvers and company 
 I was excited about this product and couldn't wait to get it. Got one on Christmas and well...hmmm. after trying it out a couple days I'm pretty dissapointed. I use it in a USB 2.0 and while the plate is pretty cold, the beverage is not. I tried it in a glass, then in a can thinking the aluminum would conduct the cold better. The difference is almost negligible. It barely keeps an already cold beverage cool...and certainly doesn't cool a room temperature beverage even after sitting on the unit for an hour. It will be somewhat cool if the volume of liquid is very low(an inch or less) A rather neat idea that just didn't totally come to fruition. You're better off just using a beverage cozy. 
 While I've been a big fan of Ghost In The Shell, these stories are the worst yet. (I've watched the first three episodes on Cartoon Network as the DVD is not out yet).   In "Make Up", the story is flawed in that Paz would have never been allowed to roam "free" while an exact copy cat of himself is on the lose killing people.  In "Poker Face" the "Emperial" America is such and Anti-American statement especially when the Amercian UN Forces have the American flag sewed on their uniforms backwards! This may have been an error but I doubt it.   In PAT. the tachikoma's voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it's hard to follow. Most if is a rehash on previous episodes. With their childest voices, they shouldn't be used as a main plot of the story 
 In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.  There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason) 
 There is a very important section of the UBC titled Conventional Light Frame construction (ch23 Div IV), which allows a designer/builder to build a house without requiring expensive engineering. This book virtually ignores it, which I feel does a great disservice to readers. Many (most?) magazine house plans do not include braced wall requirments, which are part of the above building code. It would be nice if this book addressed this important section of the UBC. Also, it seems  every time I have a building question and go to this book as a reference, it leaves me dissapointed. For example, requirements regarding grading and setbacks from slopes, etc., which can be pretty cryptic in the UBC. OK for general reading, but not a great reference book 
 Suprised. I cant believe someone would buy this trash. He has no skills, he makes Lil' Romeo look like 2 Pac 
 Listening to Gieseking play Debussy is like listening to a pianist who sat at his instrument with the composer's score stripped of all dynamic markings and performance instructions and interpreted what he saw like it were Beethoven. There are crescendos where there shouldn't be crescendos and violent and sharply biting outbursts in passages where Debussy is asking of the pianist the most gentle and delicate touch possible. I'm not saying Gieseking isn't a phenomenal pianist from a technical standpoint, but he displays so little regard for the composer's intentions. By all means, buy this record if you want to hear Gieseking, but not if you want to hear Debussy 
 I really liked the song "Somewhere in the Night" ever since I saw the episode where it was featured. The way it was played with Scott solo at the piano was haunting & powerful--just a great song. When I saw that there was a CD of it, I considered getting it and finally did. Unfortunately I didn't do my homework and was very disappointed to find that the CD version takes a sweet piano performance and turns it into a less touching and more forgettable "easy listening rock" song that doesn't do his on-screen performance of the song justice. And apparently the only place to get the piano-only version is on the episode :(   The rest of the CD is a mixed bag. Scott Bakula is definitely multi-talented, and it is enjoyable and fun to hear him play some of the different songs from the show--but nothing fantastic. The only standout vocal song on the disc would have been "Somewhere"--and that was ruined for me by the "easy listening" chorus. The instrumental tracks are okay--I'm admittedly not a big fan of instrumental music, so take my review with that grain of salt included.  As opposed to many reviewers, I quite enjoyed the interview clip. It was fun to hear some of Scott's background and what he enjoyed about working on the show. And how great is it to hear straight from the star's mouth that he would love to take the role up again in the future? As a fan, that's really nice to hear.   So my take is--if you're a QL fan, and you can get it used for a decent price, it's fun for a listen. Non-fans should probably look elsewhere.  
 If Laurie Cabot's powers are really what she reports them to be then how come: *Daughter Jody has had trouble with the law- *Laurie herself interfered with Jody's arrest- *Daughter Penney refuses to even contact her mother- They are estranged.(Check out LC's website) *A search warrant was served on Laurie Cabot's home- *Cabot attempted to put a curse on the Salem police as they served that warrant on her home- (I thought witches didn't do that. Most claim they don't.)  *The IRS is after her- This lady obviously has trouble staying in successful relationships. Even her own family ones. If she can't help herself (with her powers), how is she gonna be a help to others' 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 For such an interesting subject one really hoped it would have been more interesting.. 
 At first glance Google Hacking for Penetration Testers seems to be full of the kind of information a person new to penetrating testing needs - but soon one will find out that it isn't worth the inflated price. You can (and probably should) purchase a couple good books for the price 
 I read the first chapter and I was puzzled. Then I went back, read it again, and laughed. My tenth grade creative writing class can make a better effort at a plot, dialogue, and characterization than that, and be witty to boot. As for the quality of the writing, just the dialogue in the Quick Stop scene was enough to make my head spin around and explode. After reading this, I wasn't sure whether the author was high, or if he just hadn't seen a lot of Buffy and decided to make up the show and the characters' personalities (into something so juvenile and whacked out, it was almost incomprehensible). Did they let a 13-year-old fanboy write this? No, that can't be, because there is fanfiction out there that is many, many levels above this. ... Don't waste your money on this atrocious mess 
 the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...  anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money...  
 Another book of pretty pictures from MLB, complete with a sanitized text that mistakes acheivements for moments and re-writes history to sell more t-shirts and other authorized garbage.  The recent spate of MLB books have been particularly embarrassing and this is no better.  If you buy this book you are encouraging MLB to produce more books that seek to re-write the facts of history into a marketble form and that don't respect the intelligence of the audience.  Buy a real book, written by real writers, about a real topic, rather than something sponsored by a credit card company 
 When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced 
 I think Lynn Picknett sat down one night with a big bottle of wine and decided to rant her feelings, her research and strong opinions on some paper. She has some interesting ideas about who the Magdalene may have been or come from, and then never mentions it again- in fact here isn't much specifically about Magdalene at all.  And statements like "..when the Gnostics were silly they were extremely silly"- excuse me?? I resisted reading this book for a long time because friends who, like me, thought The Templar Revelation was an exellent book, didn't really like this one. Well, I gave it a shot, and it was not worth it 
 Milkovich and Newman? Do the other reviewer's have the right book As I right this review I have the book next to me and I can't find any reference to a Milkovich and Newman?  Whoever these fine people are I can't see how they have anything to do with this textbook.  As for the textbook, I had to use it for my introductory Management class as part of my MBA program. And halfway through my MBA program this book gets the award for the dryest, boring, waste of trees. Yeach I've complained about Marketing, but this book is far worse.    Instead of explaining the intricacies of management and addressing contemporary issues in the typical office, this book focuses on stating the obvious, restating it again, without offering any arguments, any conclusions, or even giving any advice.  Consider this typical sentence, which I found by randomly opening the book. 'As previously indicated, conflict may have either positive or negative consequences for the organization, depnding upon how much exists and how it is managed.' (pg. 358).  When they aren't boring the reader with their lack of depth and insight the authors  bore the reader with stupid asides on companies that add nothing. Consider the following sentence, 'The 13,000 restaurants in McDonald's network all pay attention to quality, service, and cleanliness.' (pg. 41). You mean the authors find it necessary to teach MBA students how to serve fast food? I thought that was the reason kids enroll in these programs so they don't won't end up working in a fast food joint.  This book was so bad, that some of my classmates gave up even trying to read the chapters, because they weren't getting anything out of it. And although the material is very elementary it's written with so much filler material that it is extremely hard reading. It as if the authors were paid based on how many words they were able to write, so that the book would look thinker and the publisher could justify it's outrageous list price.  And the worst part is that the material is so disorganized that some of the information in the chapter summaries isn't even covered in the chapters. I'm just glad I only had to put up with semester of this trash 
 I am an avid reader and love romantic stories. This book immediately caught my attention in the bookstore, it sounded funny, sexy, and very entertaining. Unfortunately this turned out to be the worst romance I have ever read. If I could have given it no stars I would have. All of the characters were extremely unlikable, especially the main character Genevieve. The "hillbilly speak" was ridiculous. The side story about Genevieve's mother took up way too much time, especially since it was so boring. The story just dragged on and on. Before reading "Nerd in Shining Armor" I had never stopped reading a book before I finished it, even if it was a bad book. Well, I can't say that anymore. Even before the first chapter had ended I had to force myself to continue reading, and then I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book. It was that horrible.  Personally, I will never try another book by Vicki Lewis Thompson no matter how amazing the back cover may sound. Please save your money and buy any other book. 
 I believe in the every growing rate of sophistication in our country and I'm sure with books like this we can take our government more seriousl 
 I read the only review for this item and ordered it, expecting to see a fantastic display of sound and some of the interaction of these artists with Mr Hancock as they created music, each colaborating to have a unique blend of sounds. Actually this is only a documentary showing this interaction, and as such is very interesting. But if you are looking to see an hear the full length videos of these great colaborations you will be disappointed, that is not included in this dvd. Only small samples are there for you to see. This was a real disapointmet because the quality of video and audio are fantastic.     
     Dershowitz' book is not so much a book about terrorism as it is specifically an attack on Palestinian terrorism and how terrorism relates to the US and our 51st state, Israel.  The author operates from the thesis of why terrorism is effective, and then proceeds to systematically discount every terrorist campaign in the world, leaving only the Israel - Palestine conflict and 9-11 for discussion.  One would expect to find more discussion on other conflicts such as those in Ireland or terrorist acts carried out by North Korea (the ultimate example of state-sponsored terrorism), but they are either nowhere to be found or completely dismissed.  Dershowitz carefully pares down his topic until he ignores practically everything in our century outside of 9-11 and the PLO.     His anti-Palestinian bias becomes more apparent later in his arguments.  His central idea is that terrorist groups feed off the success of other groups.  Because Palestinian terrorism is the most effective terrorist campaign in the world, for the sake of world security they must be defeated.  However, if you follow this logic it becomes apparent that he leaves no room for the possibility that the Palestinians might have a legitimate complaint or that perhaps they deserve certain rights that we in the US generally consider inaliable.  According to his argument, the Palestinians can never see any improvement in their situation, no matter how deserved, because such would be perceived as a victory for terrorism.  Therefore, as far as Dershowitz is concerned, they're just plain out of luck.     Dershowitz's attitude seems to be that the Palestinians should have tried nonviolent protest instead of violence.  He seems oblivious to the fact that the Israelis used violence to sieze Palestine in the first place, and while he admits that Israelis use terrorist-style violence, he never judges them in the same way he judges the Palestinians.    In fact, Dershowitz advocates the use of torture and assassination and seems to praise the Israeli use of these tactics.  I'm at a loss to explain how anyone can advocate nonviolent protest at the same time that they advocate assassination and praise 'preemptive' warfare.  I'm likewise unable to understand how anyone can caution us as to the steady erosion of our freedoms at the same time that they argue for state-sponsored torture.    To his credit, Dershowitz reminds us that even hated terrorists have constitutional rights, and he makes a plea for us to remember that even terrorists deserve due process of law.  But again, his hyprocrisy is stunningly blatant.  How can one argue for universal judicial fairness and advocate torture and assassination at the same time?  These concepts are completely antithetical to a fair, democratic judicial process.       The most frightening argument Dershowitz makes is that it is alright to allow our rights to be degraded as long as the "feel of freedom" is maintained.  (His words, not mine)  He claims that as long as our free speech is protected and our media is critical, it is alright for us to sacrifice our freedom in other ways.       In fact, Dershowitz admits that Palestinians in Israel are second-class citizens, and then says they should be thankful for it because Israel has free speech and a balanced judicial system.  I was previously unaware that bulldozing towns and bombing Palestinian civilians constituted a fair judicial system, and it really is a shame that too few Palestinians actually live long enough to enjoy it.     Anyone who reads this book should be frightened to live in a future Dershowitz America 
 The title of this book makes you think you're about to read about a character that is attempting to feel a little more free - maybe adding some spice to the love life and other spicier thing - but that's really not the case. The character instead spends a lot of time trying to help troubled women in her community, which is quite noble - just not something somebody necessarily does with a red dress on.  The reason the story must go this way is so that Ms. Cleage can take the time to spoonfeed the reader on how they should feel about the city of Idlewild, black culture, and black women. Some of the very uncreative dialogue among the characters is so overopinionated and irrelavant that I think even Ms. Cleage might have forgotten at times what her book is supposed to be about. The love exchange that happens (but never really goes far enough) is the highlight for me.  I must also add that the rushed ending also does the book little justice 
 Creating Brain reads like a chat accross the kitchen table with an occasional very brief trip to the lecture podium.     For a natural scientist, Andreasen presents lots of conclusions, such as recommendations on TV exposure to children, with little data or reason other than her personal opinion for support.  While her thoughts aren't unreasonable, they are also not supported by data.  This weakness taints the other statements (both biographical and scientific)which one hopes are better supported by the research cited. The distance of the lecture podium requires better connection between evidence and conclusion. I had hoped for more depth on current research and imaging.  Still, the accross-the-kitchen-table tone does match the interesting stories, personal anecdotes, and opinions.  Also, the complexity of nature and nurture (clearly nature vs nurture is no longer a fruitful concept)comes through well.  AFTER THE TEXT a tempting bibliography including material said to be freely available from Andreasen's institution may lead to works of more rigor that do not sacrifice good explanation of methods.  
 The 365 Cats Page-A-Day Calendar for 2004 was a favorite of my family: large format excellent photographs in a sturdy holder. Everything about the 2005 version says cheap and minimal production cost: small low quality photos in a flimsy holder with text instead of cativating photos. Who wants to read a lot of useless text on a cat calendar? Where are the charming photos?  Larry - Los Alamos, N 
 After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work.  This is not what I was looking for 
 I have never read this author before and probably won't again. I found the story hard to follow from the beginning and if you are an animal lover you probably will be as repulsed as I was in the sequence about "skinning the cat down to his whiskers and watching him stagger around."  This book is going in the trash literally and I didn't care to read any further than the cat episode which was quite early on 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 This is a retelling of the Canterbury Tales, very simplified...in some cases leaving out the best parts!  I believe it may have been originally intended safe for children.    If you're looking for a translation into modern English, keep looking.  I am 
 Take this book Back!  That's waht I think. I have taught myself many programs including flash & excell from books but this book stinks!  I am a novice to access and learned nothing on how to create anything from scratch.  All this showed me is how to use an existing database.  Well that does me no good since i can't figure out how to make my own!  Time to find a better book 
 One of the most ridiculous pieces of minimalist trash out there. It just goes to show you where a lot of time, a lot of money, popular culture, and a twisted world view have landed so much of American. Don't waste your time or your money on this. 
 I watched this film as part of my history studies in Post-War Europe and before everyone docks me because I gave it two stars, hear me out.  I'm no Godard fan so I may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of The New Wave might.  I'm just your regular Joe Movie-Watcher.  Masculin Feminin is about Paul, a 21-year-old French citizen that just retired from his 16 months in the Army.  Paul is a believer in Marxism and throughout the film promotes the Worker's Party while denouncing US involvement in Vietnam, the Du Gaulle government and most forms of Westernism such as condoms, psychadelic rock (many songs in Masculin Feminin have a style similar to The Kinks, Jefferson Airplane etc) and even Coca-Cola... yet Paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini-bowling game you see at an arcade.  Paul seems to be the pro-French identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine.  The preserver of the romanticized French culture.    However, Paul's friends and interviewees (Paul works for the IFOP, the major French polling agency at the time) seem to not care about the change towards a quasi-American consumer state.  Paul's girlfriend Madelein is a rising pop-singer, her room mates are materialistic consumers, one who owns a car, and the people Paul interviews seem to only care about themselves.  This is very accurate in terms of how the 'baby-boom' generation of French youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in Europe.  Like the teens in the 1950s in the US, the teens began to form their own demographic.  However, this is where my fascination ends.  Godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing.  In many parts in the movie, Godard fixed the camera on one person's face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a 15-minute back and forth conversation.  The volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue, making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience.    In a few parts when Paul was whistling, the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as I heard static in the speakers.  I thought this was a volume problem on my end so I turned it down, nope... it was the sound editing.  This is just poor recording and editing.  Furthermore, the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun-noise sound (which sounded more like a cartoon car noise) over and over and over again and in very unlikely times.    Other times, ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises.  Sometimes the sound didn't kick in for up to five seconds into the scene.    Because this is a French New Wave film, I won't attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly.  However, I strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just in the general audience and not a New Wave fan.  Otherwise, you might like this New Wave classic but I'm no expert on the subject.  I was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming, recording and editing.  
 Unless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks.  Putrid!  Not even "so-bad-it's-funny". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind!  Heed my warning!  SUCKS!! 
 Its a shame that in todays world that all a producer needs to do is copy someone elses work and take credit for it. Sometimes the results can be good though, and sometimes bad. But to tell you the truth, this really isn't the best of albums using blue note samples. If you want to hear the real rawness and flavour of these tracks, I would advise you to get the originals. You would then not be dissapointed. Otherwise if you are just looking for a mixed up compilation of cuts that have'nt really been worked on properly but still sound ok because of the original elements are there, get this. I like lootpack, madlib on other productions and especially madlibs(quasi,YNQ)own projects too, I love hip hop, and mostly hip hop that has sampled jazz cuts which is a big part of my life(i.e. TCQ, black sheep, chi ali, KMD, LOTNS, main source, artifacts, premiers stuff, DITC, etc. 90's was the time, list goes on forever!!) and added to them for a little extra flavour. But the reality is, theres a lot of originals that are always better because they have their own arrangements and vocals sounding excellent already, then the work on the newer versions just take the good parts away, make it sound wack or change it horribly. The original artists came up with the music, wrote it down, then played on REAL INSTRUMENTS!(thats talent!), not digital workstations, samplers, turntables and grooveboxes for easy access to stealing tracks and getting credit for it. So you have to beat that and make it worthwhile what you are actually doing otherwise it's a waste of time, whether ten steps ahead, or one step ahead, but never back any steps!!. And don't get me wrong, I use all of these types of equipment for studios too aswel as instruments. Sampling can be excellent if done properly like madlib has shown before. If you can achieve the nice sound of the original and progress it or highlight sections and make them stand out with different sections compositions without ruining it, thats tight!. But on here theres nothing that makes it any way as good as the originals, and mostly does not sound too good. Mainly because of production reasons, I do not feel enough was put into it or thought about to advance from the original blue note compositions. And it can change perceptions deeply. I mean, one example, the bobbi humphreys sampled cut 'Please Set Me at Ease'has been processed and sounds like it was auto bpm mixed with a beat in a WAV studio and it makes it sound electronic(not intentionally) and off-key, and it gets repetitive, I liked hearing the 6-7 minutes of the original and never got bored of it because of its variation and bobbis singing, it also sounded how it should sound like(the quality). Theres so much to say about this album, but not enough space or time, I just hope hope Blue note would call me up next time, I really appreciate all their work with my heart. But if you are just looking for a little flavour and you don't know too much about blue note, i'd say get it. If you have a ear and genuine love for instrumental compositions in Blue note work, any other good jazz artists, or even If you have produced for a while and know about using samples too you will understand me. Otherwise it must be on your level and not mine so tick me 'unhelpful'. I give this 2 stars, 1 for the fact it contains blue note classics and 1 for madlibs appreciation and effort too. He is a tight producer, its just this don't show his real skills. But thats all!! hope i helped. Choose wisely people! Peace 
 There are a couple of good songs on here. I love the song Sunday Morning. But then they went and put crappy songs like "Hey Baby" and "Hella Good" on it, and it just went to hell. Plus all of their most overrated songs, which I just am not a big fan of. No Doubt was awesome up until Return Of Saturn, and Gwen's solo career just sucks horribly. 
 You all like misogynist comics 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 steph believes her husband leaves her after thirteen years of marriage because of her boring flannel night gowns and unshaved legs. in the meantime, she meets peter and quickly falls in love.  peter is into bionics and while he goes away on business trips, he leaves behind his clone, paul to keep his girlfriend company.  steph is torn because she finds herself in love with both peter and paul.  when she's not having sex with peter, she's doing sexual acrobatics with paul.  the whole story line is utterly ridiculous.  the only reason i finished the book was because i was hoping it would get better.  i kept thinking this would make some kind of comedy.  unfortunately, i don't think danielle steel had comedy in mind when she wrote it.  i do believe the reader was supposed to get sucked into a romantic love triangle.  that didn't happen!  instead, i continued to dislike steph's insecure, sex crazed character less and less.  
 This movie has too much talking and absolutely zero action, and a misusage of Christina Ricci's talent. The whole movie is Woody Allen making a tribute to himself. Allen plays one of the main characters and the rest of the actors are obviously too much in awe, or is it fear, of him to improvise on lines that would have fit if Woody Allen was saying them, but really didn't fit their characters. Much of the plot plainly doesn't make coherent sense, and all that whining is tiring and cliche. Eeeegads! The movie would have been better if Woody Allen wasn't in it, and if Ricci wasn't used to add depth to an undeniably stupid shallow character. (Rose McGowan would have played a better Amanda, incidentally.) There needs to be much more action and storytelling in this movie, than the much too much neurotic talking. What a waste of talent and time 
 This book was pretty bad. I listened to it as a book on tape unabridged. In many ways this is a better format to enjoy a book than actually reading it in my opinion, so please don't groan and dismiss what I say because of that. The reason I say that I listened to this book is that it forced me to hear every single written word and I am sure that if I were to have held it in my hands instead I would have flipped past half the pages to figure out how it ended. What bugs me to no end about this book and the author is that he has taken a couple of ideas (a missing FBI file, a rock climbing lady, an honest FBI guy on the outs with the system, and crooked politicians) and then proceeded to play these against each other with reckless abandon. Mills pretty much tugs every possible tried and true method to further a weak ass plot. The end result is a painful display of shoddy writing that gives his genre a bad name.  Tom Clancy actually gave this book a pretty good couple of review quotes and is mentioned on the books cover. I wonder how much he was paid to write a couple nice lines. In my opinion, Clancy wrote a few pretty good reads early on but has turned out some incredible trash as of late, and I say this because Free Fall is a lot like one of Clancy's later books. If you want a comparison, this might be an apt one. MIlls does have potential however, much of what he wrote was almost good and I look forwards to reading his work in a few years. 
 In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 While the songs on this disc are generally recognized as French, the performances are too flowery.  The flowery nature detracts from the overall French experience.  It is not what I expected at all, especially based on the other Amazon reviews.  The arrangements on this disc remind me of elevator music 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 The set is VERY small and the pins are so small that they will not even stand up on their own.  It is cheaply made, choose another bowling set 
 After a while you'll never get those "rugged concentric grooves" clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear.  I'd never recommend Circulon cookware because of this, especially since there are so many high-quality, smooth-bottomed pans on the market 
 I'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored.  I am no fan of Bill O'Reilly and this novel is not the greatest, but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions...especially if, from the looks of some of these reviews, a reviewer have not actually read this book.  We need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits.    RE: a previous reviewer's statement that "under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko [...]".  The character in question was a villain who briefly appeared -- a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a 15-year-old when the hero/vice cop apprehended him.  In fact, O'Reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story: "Obviously, he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene."    That's the main problem with the novel.  He doesn't understand how a story is told, and it doesn't appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes.  He interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses: "Homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty".  You get the picture.  The details are not horribly original, but nothing is stolen outright that I can pinpoint.  And some scenes and subplots were actually funny.  I have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice.     There is nothing gratuitous, [...], or intentionally [...] in this book.  It is just mediocre -- but I did stick with it to the very end.  If you like media-related mysteries or O'Reilly, check it out of the library like I did.  Fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time.     
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I learned more on wpf from Microsoft Expression blend tutorials on weblogs than i did in this book.  It will tell you a lot about  1)Layout (manual layout in code/xaml) 2)Graphics (manual graphics in code/xaml)  It will NOT tell you about 1) dynamic data binding 2) how to create an app start to finish using expression and all of the tools available to you for wpf 3) how to validate data 4) how to use the navigation service and pages 5) how to use page functions 6) how to use property bags   And those are just the road blocks i've run into so far and had to research on my own. This book really let me down by not giving me even the slightest hint into the tools i would need to finish a business project 
 Nine is a beautiful show... one of the most amazing shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I did not see the revival, and this recording does not in anyway make me wish I had. Antonio's performance is extremely flat. It all seems so calculated and rehearsed, which is not at all Guido's character. Guido Contini is charming, smooth, and a con-artist in many ways. Antonio missed that completely. I saw his performance on the Tony Awards show, and it made me want to cry. There was none of the character I loved so much there.  The other performances were, for the most part, ok to good. None surpassingly great, except Chita Rivera, who, sadly, does not have enough to do to save the show.  Get the original 
 Perhaps I'd put too much stock in all the praise I'd seen heaped on Charles McCarry and this book. What a great espionage writer he is, the party line went. Our Le Carré, etc., etc. But this book, which I purchased at full price in hardcover, was so dull and disappointing that I gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through. McCarry probably has been as good as his admirers say, but in this book, he seems to have switched on the auto-pilot, taken the money, and run. I quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names - dropped, it appears, as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge - and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to, as if scouting locations for a movie. I have not given up; I will now try his earlier books, starting with 'Tears of Autumn,' and keep my fingers crossed. I remain hopeful 
 - Bentley's 'Programming Pearls' offers many programming techniques and design principles. - But the text assumes that the reader is *extremely* familiar with C-style syntax and many advanced computer science concepts.  While Bentley emphasizes important fundamentals, his language is rather esoteric.  I bought this book because Steve McConnell ('Code Complete' author) recommends it for 'beginner' developers at his company (Construx Software); but I encourage 'beginner' developers (and even senior developers) to look elsewhere.  This book is meant for computer science graduate students. It incorporates more advanced math and more advanced computer science techniques than the average software developer will ever encounter.  Most of 'Programming Pearls' was penned before the widespread use of object-oriented programming; so Bentley heavily emphasizes code tuning. In today's world, most .NET and J2EE developers are likely to find greater efficiencies within their architectural design.  - Developers who need to either learn or revisit important fundamentals should read Steve McConnell's 'Code Complete' 
 Great machine but do NOT buy it for a Vista system.  Even if they state on their website the system is compatible, they forgot to mention that the scanner software is a generic one included with Vista. Scans only one sheet at a time. Does not output PDF files.  So the document feeder is useless for scanning.  They do not even have an ETA for a new driver. If history is a good guide ....when XP was launched it took them for some of their systems a full year to get the drivers ready.  
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 Sorry this one is NOT a good one. Hailey North is purely a hit or miss author. The last two books I've read of hers have been awful though. I don't think I'll waste any more money on her books. There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the "hero", Alistair. Who wants a seventies hippie type hero??? Birkenstocks??? Please! - Yuck! Gray hair? No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me. And Lauren, the "heroine", seemed really, really immature. Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good). Did I mention immature? So, basically, heroine has nothing going for her but looks, and hero has nothing going for him but money...where does this leave us? Going to bed early, which is NOT a sign of a good book. Spend your money on another author 
 These headphones bang into your head with the music... I guess that might be cool, but the sound fades in and out and you look like a moron with headphones banging into your head. You can turn off the "brain shaking" feature, but the sound quality is still poor and they are really, really uncomfortable 
 Give me a break people.  A tribute to Donna Summer with really bad remakes.  The only track worth anything is the Laura Brannigan redo of Dim All The Lights.  If you like that track then buy Laura's album its worth it.  Other than that save your money and dont buy this sad CD of bad remakes.  Here's an idea...how bout some fresh music.  Between Hollywood and the record industry, the continuous reworking of old material is wearing thin 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 I thought Weston's book was a little too short when I first picked it up. Turns out I should have relied on my instincts.  While I believe Weston does a fair job introducing readers to the concept of arguing, he fails terribly overall. Basically, any student that took Math in high school that involved "proofs" would know Weston's entire book.   The only thing I really enjoyed was the index on "cheating."  Don't get this book if you have ever taken anything involving mathematical proofs or philosophy. Otherwise, knock yourself out 
 Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched.  I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and  elaborately, once you realize who she is.  I've read worse books, but after  the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a  strange, sad let-down 
 I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with Stephen Hawking.  Sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a Hawking work.  Naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  I AM a chemist, and despite this, Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  If you want to learn some cosmology, read "A Brief History of Time" or "A Short History of the Universe".  These are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 Bell's book has been an inspiration to several generations of mathematicians, encouraging them to pursue the creative discipline of mathematics.  For that, he has done a great service to mathematics.    Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this book.  E.T. Bell was a respected Caltech mathematician, who dabbled in writing books about mathematical history.  He was a great writer with style, which has led many to believe he was also an eminent scholar of history of mathematics.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Bell manages to perpetrate fiction in almost every other line, mangling known facts, making unwarranted judgments and characterizations of personalities and motives.  Whatever he needs to do to construct an entertaining story, he does.  His name is universally cursed by historians of mathematicians.  Making up stuff for a good story might not ordinarily be bad.  After all, a lot of people do it, and certainly encouraging youngsters to study mathematics is not a bad goal.  But there are several ways in which this book is insidious.  One is the negative potrayal of women mathematicians.  As the astute reader will have noted, the title is *Men* of Mathematics.  (On my paperpack edition, the word "men" is even set off by a different color than the rest of the title!)  The forgiving reader may be willing to forgive this; after all, the book was written in less politically correct times, and certainly most of the famous and well-documented mathematicians are men.  Gauss?  A man.  Euler?  A man also.  Etc.  On the other hand, there are notable examples of great mathematicians who happened to be women.  Emmy Noether and Sonja Kowalewski, for example.  Women who are mentioned in Bell's book, but are either paid little attention to or treated rather badly, in a way that clearly highlights Bell's own prejudices.  Some readers will be struck by sentences like "Sonja's sex had got the better of her ambitions and she had been living happily with her husband."  Rather than list more examples, let me stop by adding that this kind of sentence is typical of Bell, and doesn't stand out much.  What is perhaps the most revealing is that Chapter 22, "Master and Pupil", which is about Weierstrass and Kowalewski, spends undue amount of time discussing Kowalewski's sexual attributes and their effect on her mathematical colleagues and teachers, and little explaining her contributions to mathematics.    Bell also shows prejudice when  he explains that the dispute between Cantor and Kronecker was due, in part, because:   "Rightly or wrongly, Cantor blamed Kronecker for his failure to obtain the coveted position at Berlin.  The aggressive clannishness of Jews has often been remarked, sometimes as an argument against employing them in academic work, but it has not been so generally observed that there is no more vicious academic hatred than that of one Jew for another when they disagree on purely scientific matters or when one is jealous or afraid of another.  Gentiles either laugh these hatreds off or go at them in an efficient, underhand way which often enables them to accomplish their spiteful ends under the guise of sincere friendship.  When two intellectual Jews fall out they disagree all over, throw reserve to the dogs, and do everything in their power to cut one anothers' throats or stab one another in the back."  This quote was later modified (I think it might have been after Bell's death) to be about styles of academic infighting, rather than a commentary about Jews and Gentiles.  Bell typically exaggerates or just plain makes things up in order to make for a better story, but I think such a false potrayal of mathematicians cannot be good.  The chapter on Galois, the most famous part of the book, is replete with historical errors and omissions, including rearranging order of events, leaving out the less savory aspects of Galois' personality, and basically saying Galois invented Galois theory the night before the duel, even though parts of his work were published and known by that time to other mathematicians.    Bell consistently paints Galois as misunderstood and his older mathematical colleagues as buffoons.  This is a seductive thought to some, but the reality is that great mathematical ideas don't have to be suppressed in order to be dormant.  Truly great ideas can sometimes take years to sink in.  Not a romantic viewpoint perhaps, but I think Galois' greatness is enhanced, not diminished, by this realization.  (Of course, Galois's inability/unwillingness to better communicate his ideas didn't help!)  This book is certainly inspirational for some, but especially for today's audience, I think it'll be glaringly biased and I doubt very inspiring for young girls in particular.  The worst thing you can do is give this book to your child to read.  There have been many books since then that are more accurate and less prejudiced in flavor 
 This movie concentrates on Cobb as a bitter old drunk desperately trying to get his life story told from his point of view.  I expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball, but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning....and that scene is very short and quite poor.  If you are interested in what Cobb was like as an old angry man, go for it.  If you are interested in Cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever.....skip this one in a hurry.  Other than that, I thought the movie - on its own merits as a movie - was pretty lousy.  I regret buying it 
 This book is very comprehensive, which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background. As someone who knew nothing about Islam prior to reading this book, I was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that Lapidus has arranged. As you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book, it is VERY wordy. Like most history texts, it is also very dry and devoid of emotion. The author does, however, provide a complex view of Islam that is fair and accurate 
 I'm not much of a mystery, but was taking a class on the mystery novel at school and this was one of the books assigned. Maybe it's me, but it's always seemed to me that the detective should be responsible for the resolution of the case. Not here. Everything turns out nicely without the detective actually having solved the case. Furthermore, Spring's prose didn't do much for me. Her paratactic sentences felt forced, rather than displaying natural speech rhythms.  Not a satisfying read at all 
 I LOVE Christmas.  I love the festive atmosphere.  I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.  This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to.  A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more "upbeat" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than "a disco Christmas" and severely test my love for the music of the season.  Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere 
 Bought my Go510 on November 14 as a Christmas present for the wife. It comes with only 90 days of warranty. Today is April 6 and the thing is broken. For a few days it had trouble finding the satellites, then just went dead. It was never abused, never left the car. Out of warranty for just 45 days, $600 wasted. It is junk! Stay away from it 
 This book has all the 'hooks' to make a good read, but it isn't.  The repetitive self-questioning done by the main character, Carolyn Blue, seems unending.  The food part was fun, but the plot was obvious and the end no suprise.  The so-called 'adventure' seemed more like a plodding through plotting effort.  The occasional vulgar word seemed planted for effect,  and the acting-as-if-she-were-insulted main character had no  ring of truth whatever.  Save your money 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 The paperback (yellow) edition does not have pictures, rather it has placeholders for the images (as if there were an error in typesetting.)  The text content, however, is fantastic for children.  GET THE HARDCOVER, (RED) EDITION - IT HAS THE CORRECT ILLUSTRATIONS 
 Interesting book.  Unfortunately it really plays on stereotypes.  It does have a few valuable things to say though 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal 
 Okay but does not keep cool for long. I do like the massage effect from the beads 
 I've sat in front of this book for a week, barely making a dent in it.  Flanner purports to tell the story of French culture, but succeeds only in revealing that she is a socialite concerned only with the deaths of famous authors. The book is organized into one-paragraph snippets summarizing the latest death, of Lindbergh or Monet, for instance.  However, instead of reflecting the culture of Paris in the era, Flanner simply summarizes the lives of her subjects.  Her description of Monet ends, as do many, with a count of how many people attended his funeral. Simply put, the book reads like the journal of a socialite who is out of touch with common culture.  It is not interesting neither literarily or historically 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 New editions of this book continue being published to have teachers require "the new edition" from students. This way the publisher and the compilers keep on plundering unashamedly the parents' pockets. Interestingly, to compile comes from the latin "compilare", which means to plunder. Compilation as it is, plus "obvious" literary theory, this book should cost no more than its weight in paper plus a few dollars. The obvious recommendation to the student is: when completed the course sell this "brick" before a new edition appears, and buy and read the full versions of the classics (Sophocles, Shakespeare, Lord Tennyson, Ibsen, Chekhov, Faulkner, Melville, Browning, J. Keats, Donne, Wordsworth, W. B. Yeats, ...); disregard all the remaining mediocre authors this book includes. Regarding Sophocles, Oedipux Rex, the translation the compilers have chosen is by Duddley Fitts and Robert Fitzgerald. Fitts was playwriter, and Fitzgerald, academic as he was and popularly known for his translations of The Iliad and The Odyssey, was never a "translator" but a "paraphraser". Read the translations by Lattimore for a "taste" of the originals, instead. Regarding "obvious" literary theory" a few sentences choosen at random from the 9th edition will suffice: Drama "normally presents its action (a) through actors, (b) on stage, and (c) before and audience" (pp.1028).  "The sharpness and vividness of any image will ordinarily depend on how specific it is and on the poet's use of effective detail" (pp. 702).  "Talented authors achieve compression by exercising a careful selectivity" (pp. 274).  
 I recently purchased Linda Collister's EASY COOKIES for my teenage daughter's Christmas. It is a well-styled cookbook with beautiful photographs, and recipes that appear well-suited for cooks of all ages. Unfortunately, upon trying the recipe for gingerbread cookies, my daughter discovered that it did not work. I then tried the same recipe to discover that, indeed, it simply did not produce anything edible. I have not yet tried other recipes from the book. Having such results with the first recipe attempted, I hesitate to try others.  The books title might be changed to EASY COOKIE RECIPES THAT MIGHT NOT WORK. 
 I ordered this product almost two weeks ago and it is not even shipped yet 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 A totally worthless piece of garbage 
 I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 Being the action packed sequel to Jumanji, Zarthura follows the same feel as its predecessor, with even a title mention to the board game Jumanji mentioned in the book. Two feuding, young brothers, Walter and Danny, encounter a board game, Jumanji in the woods as they are wrestling around. Not until they get home do they realize there is another more "adult" game tucked inside.  Danny, the younger of the two, unknowingly starts a chain of space travel events by rolling the dice.  Eventually, normalcy is restored when Walter rolls the dice and is sucked through a black hole back in time before the game is found.  A distinct theme of slowing down and appreciating your family is found.  Allsburg uses his distinct artwork once again in this book. 	I was disappointed with the book.  While it was a good book, and a cool idea, I felt like it was too much like Jumanji to really enjoy.  The artwork had the same feel.  The story line was similar.  It was just too much alike for me to like.  
 It may be inspirational and it brings tears of joy to my eyes, but hey, what about the "what's" and "how's"? Empty 
 I am a senior in college majoring in history and I just finished writing a paper about this book for a college class, and after reading the other reviews for it here I feel I should write my own really quick to present a different opinion.  It was a good book, and did give a good view into the lives of colonial women, but I'm wondering what anyone learned from it.  There was nothing surprising at all, completely mundane.  I do not feel there's a need to argue the importance of women in history, no one's writing any books about how great chairs are for sitting, it's understood.  Of course no society could develop and function without women and all of the very important things they do, to me thats a given.  Anyway, I wont go on any more but in my opinion the book just isn't groundbreaking or interresting on any level what so ever 
 Nothing insightful or witty to be read in this book.  The childish writing style could only entertain a true dullard and left me feeling talked down to.  That being said, the WORST aspect is that the author would actually want to make a public record of his disgusting self-absorption 
 This book is a prime example of how ignorant politicians are of the principles upon which this country was founded on and in particular the US Constitution.  One chapter of this book is even called "Reclaiming our constitutional democracy."  Reclaiming our constitutional what?  The US is a Republic, not a democracy.  Our founders loathed mobocracy.  No where in the US Constitution is "democracy" even mentioned, although the Constitution guarantees a republican form of government for every state.  In the introduction, Ted writes that one of the "challenges" is "to provide health care to every American."  Excuse me, where in the Constitution does it say that the Federal Government is to provide health care?  Take a look at the 10th article in the Bill of Rights, Ted.  Health care is not a Federal issue.  So stay out of it.  Another "challenge" is to "restore our basic values."  I wonder what basic values Ted has in mind here (because at this point I could not stomach this tripe anymore and had to put the book away).  Then again, considering this book is written by a man who escaped a manslaughter conviction after leaving a woman to drown in his car, my curiosity over Ted's "basic values" has been abated 
 this was not funny at all.i've seen pablo francisco's stand-up on HBO and was pleasantly entertained but this dvd was awful and boring as hell 
 Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.  It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look.  There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.  On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller 
 There are highlights here besides the well-received Yo That's A Lot Of Body with solid (though not amazing) New Jack Swing tracks such as Straight Down To Business, Cat-Thang, and World Party. Unfortunately, most of the other material is pretty cliche and boring. It's a worthy enough purchase suited for low prices 
 i had seen partial photos of some of the designs in the book before ordering. a couple seemed very new and interesting. when the book arrived, and i could see the ones i was interested in, they did not live up to my expectations. some of the newer ribbon type "yarns" were used but the design work just wasn't unusual enough to inspire me.   
 Every section of this book gives great plans for having fun in your neighborhood. I live in an area that already has scheduled events, but this gives many more ideas for other opportunities to involve those not already involved. I also like the sections on what to do when someone moves into your neighborhood, has a prolonged illness, or if someone dies... it give many good ideas on meals or practical things to do 
 This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible.  The characters are incredibly unrealistic.  Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace.  I couldn't relate at all, it took for ever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just uninteresting.  I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is    not like her usual work.  I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way 
 My mother gave me this book and her first cookbook, too.  Hard to believe, but this book seems worse than the first one.  She must get paid a bazillion dollars by the Processed Food Association because no one in their right mind would use so much crappy processed food in their recipes.  She seems totally oblivious to the fact that fresh food is available in her regular supermarket and that its just as easy to use in recipes 
   Doesn't liven up until the last two chapters.   Characters are two-dimensional 
 I rented this movie because, well, uh...I have no idea why I rented this movie but I'm glad I did because Jaime Bergman is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.  I actually made a "Oh!" sound when she came onscreen.  I haven't done that since the Nazi girl in ED GEIN.  Sadly, Jaime did not get naked.  How rude.  Angel Boris, the other female lead, does get naked for about a minute and while she's nowhere near as hot as Jaime I'm still grateful.  Thank you.  Also at the very beginning of the movie there is a very good looking waitress.    Oh yea there's also some snakes.  The CGI reptiles are pretty bad, but first time director David Flores manages to pull it off and make this film kinda fun thanks to a good sense of humor and some interesting characters including a  reporter who blames all of the destruction on Al Queda; a group of gung-ho hunters who kill a rabbit with a hand grenade and a cop who gets excited, slips and falls face first into a pile of guts.  "I think you have a piece of liver on your face."  Worth watching as long as you remember not to expect too much from a movie called BOA VS. PYTHON. 
 I love vintage Andre Norton Science Fiction (also fantasy), especially her series such as The Time Traders, Solar Queen, and most of the previous Beast Master books.  But this book came as a big disappointment.  I thought the previous volume (Beast Master's Circus) was quite good, and enjoyed the new character Laris and her alien cat Prauo, who are the main characters in this new book.  However, this latest book soon degenerates into a number of teenage temper tantrums, and had me gritting my teeth instead of enjoying the book. The plot was interesting to begin with, but the juvenile personal interactions overshadowed everything else.  Possibly a (young) teenager would like this book, but I have other suggestions for Norton fans.  I've been reading Andre Norton since the 50's, and have over 80 of her hardcovers, dating as far back as 1944, so I have a lot to compare with, and this one I'd rate as one of the 3 worst of her books.  Since all three are fairly recent and were written with co-authors, I suspect that Ms. Norton did very little of the plotting and writing herself, and of course, she passed away almost a year before this book was published.  If you want some good, recent Norton, try the Time Traders and Solar Queen books co-authored with Sherwood Smith, or the "Mark of the Cat/Year of the Rat" pair, which was a total and delightful surprise to me--hearkening back to the vintage "Star Man's Son" in some spots 
 When I read the jacket at the bookstore I just had to get it.  And seeing how the author was so acclaimed from his "Comes A Horseman" novel I figured this would be a great book.  All I can really say about it is it's one of those stories that builds up and builds up but never really delivers 
 The Author doesn't really demonstrate any long term problems of the "hook-up culture" and cites a discredited theory about women's bodies not producing oxytocin when they engage in multiple hookups.  She talks to a few women who have had disappointing relationships but doesn't really provide any compelling evidence in her conclusion 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I have not read this book but I am a real life Eunuch. I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says "Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity." WRONG!!!  How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing 
 The author puts forth a "New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out. 
 I can't believe the other reviewers read the same book I did! Early on, the author relates his method for dealing with his dogs after they've killed several chickens. He beats them, ties them up for days without food, hits them with chicken carcasses, and ties dead chickens around their necks until the chickens rot away.  And he tells this story as if it reflects well on his problem-solving ability. I know he was inexperienced at farming at the beginning of the story but you don't have to be especially bright to know that 1. Chickens who remove all the grass in their enclosure will make every effort to get to where the grass is greener.  2. Chickens are prey. 3. Dogs -- especially unneutered males -- have a strong prey drive. 4. Combine untrained, unneutered dogs with freely roaming chickens and it's bound to end in tears. The whole imbroglio is Stewart's fault but his response is to beat and torture the dogs into submission. (I was immensely relieved to learn that he has no children.) In his chapter on farm dogs, he prattles on ignorantly about how much they love being chained to a tree at night and their pleasure at living out of doors in all kinds of weather, while the reader grows increasingly depressed.   One can only be grateful that he concentrates on vegetables.  But no matter how great his veggies are, he's ignorant about and mean to the animals in his care. (Rather than my usual practice of giving old books to the library, I threw this book out. I wouldn't want to encourage anyone else to read it. 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 Before you get cross with me for the 2 star rating - give me a chance to explain.   1.)  I devoured the (3) previous HALO novels.  I most liked First Strike, Fall of Reach was a close second, & Flood a distant third.   2.)  Eric Nylund is arguably the most authoratative historian of the HALO universe.  His creative imagination is well suited at developing hard SF out of thin air!  I salute him. 3.)  However, Ghosts of Onyx does not contain Master Chief or Cortana.  Huge mistake.   4.)  All of you that would argue that the series needed an infusion of new recruits into the Spartan family - I agree wholeheartedly.  There were infinite ways to blend Cortana and the Master Chief into this story.   5.)  Equiping the new recruits with anything other than Mjolnir was yet another huge mistake.  Spartans should be sealed inside a Mjolnir cocoon - PERIOD!  There is actually a moment in Ghosts where a Spartan 2 decides AGAINST donning the (superior in every way) Mjolnir armor - and instead decides for symbolic reasons to don the inferior and yet stealthy Spartan 3 armor.  GAG!  CHOKE!  Spartan 2s were trained to use overwhelming force to achieve victory - not leave their Mjolnir in a freaking air conditioned locker!  MAKES ME SICK!  That Spartan should be court marshalled for that egregiously poor decision.  I would type more but it would be a spoiler.  6.)  Mr. Nylund - I'm sure you do not have complete creative control on these projects - so for the gripes I have that you may share - I apologize.  My opinion likely mean little to you.  However, if you find yourself reading Amazon reviews late one evening - please let this one resonate. As a reader of HALO, I find myself feeling like I did whenever I watched Star Trek.  Why did the Enterprise even have shields, when every race they met could defeat them?  I can accept that every human soldier is woefully unprepared for contact with the Covenant - except my SPARTANS.  Give my Spartans Forerunner tech that interfaces with their Mjolnir armor and weapons - to give the Covenant pause.  This slight advantage will be tempered by the fact that the Covenant forces always outnumber SPARTANs.  Thanks 
 What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.  Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn.  Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed.   I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.  Now I have a 'plain' scooter...  I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more.. 
 I agree with the previous review.  The deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out 
 Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it and I would not buy another bathing suit from Amazon as it cost me money to send it back.  
 These sages' examples of bravery and devotion are inspiring.  Their words, deeds, and teachings stand alone like all great masters. I feel blessed to have seen, read and spoken their sacred words.  For that I am greatful, however, what these sages do not need is a rude and angry woman standing on their shoulders with an axe to grind 
 This book was interesting and held my attention to the end (hence the 2 stars). However, it was full of cliches and the end was predictable (and a bit ridiculous). I felt nothing for the characters, who were under-developed, and yes, they were all there: the good guy with the past that still haunts him, the bold and smart heroine, the computer geek, the obsessed bad guy who, at the end, gets what he deserves...Only read it if you like Hollywood-type adventures and don't really care for real literature.That said, if you love Dan Brown, you'll probably like this book 
 I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.  AVOID this movie. It's terrible. Not one positive thing could be said about this movie 
 I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe 
 Webb has some gold that he mined out... with the redemptive movement thought.  However, the book was left wanting.  He sets uo the "rules" by which scripture is examined and lo and behold when he goes to scripture he find things that make his point.  When scripture conflicts with where he is going then it is merely background noise... not something significant.    He goes to the Bible and finds it to say exactly what he desires it to say rather than letting the living scripture speak.  It was a massive struggle to finish the book.  
 This seat is very dangerous and set my daughter's potty training back months. The seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it! Thank goodness I was still holding her! She did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after! Potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse! The only reason I gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one 
 I was expecting a really great story when I bought this book.  I've been watching the TV show Lost since it first aired, and I thought that reading this book would be a fun way to find some tidbits and clues about the backstory of the television program.  While the story was mildly interesting, the pages were filled with cliches and poor delivery.  I would have bene much happier with the book if I had known that prior to buying it.  I still would have purchased the book because of its connection to the television show, but I wouldn't have been expecting a well told mystery to come with the package 
 The glimpse inside the book (and the beautiful doll on the front) are very misleading.  I was expecting to get a book for more advanced folders; most of the projects inside were very simple.  It is a great book for someone just starting out because it gives one a thorough look at the basics of origami, but it was NOT what I was looking for at all.  The A-Z is clever, but I think they stretched to get some of the letters and I think, by following the letter pattern, they missed out on some other great objects that start with the same letter as something they already had.  The book was disappointing, at best 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 This book was required for the DE classes at UTexas for a first/second year student, encountering DE's for the first time.  The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's.  However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through.  The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material.  For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times.  In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that?  In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new.  Overall the examples are vague 
 THIS  CD  IS  NOT  MARTINAS  BEST.  I  LIKE  HER  A  LITTLE  SO  FOR  ME  I  GUESS  ITS  THE  FACT  OF  NOT  BEING  A  BIG  FAN.  MY  FAVORITE  SONG  ON  THIS  CD  IS  CONCRETE  ANGEL 
 Very ! ! ! Got my new card and it didn't work so had to send it back. So upon calling Adorama every person I talked to was rude, short, and not helpful.  They did send me out a new one hopefully it will work.  I do know one thing I will never ever buy from Adorama again. BEWARE rude people and lousy customer service at Adorama. I will return to tell you more on how my new card is working for me.  
 I like to try out the examples myself. I have made numerous attempts to acces the book's website. I get a message from my browser that the wesbsite cannot be found. I have emailed both the author and the publisher but have not recieved a response.  I have also found at least one mistake in the book. Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2 is supposed to show a web page without a style sheet vis-a-vis Figure 2.4 which shows the same page with the style sheet applied. However, they both look exactly alike 
 Marc Eliot is the literary equivalent of Edward D. Wood, Jr. 'Nuff said 
 Before buying this book, I wished I had read the review below that says, "For every winner there is at least one loser. For every big winner generally there are a few losers. The successful ones do study the stock market in detail and they depend upon substantial understanding of the share market system but knowledge is not enough, you need something else as well. If it was simply knowledge and easy, then arrogant inexperienced fools like this writer who are obviously extremely intelligent would have made money instead of losing it."  For one thing if the author knew at least a little bit about stop loss techniques before entering the stock market, he would not have lost so much money with his stock purchases. Maybe he is just so frustated and wants to show how smart he is and that only a random market could beat him as it did. Maybe he just wants to show that with the mathematics he had all he needed to enter the market, that no additional domain knowledge would be needed.  But then he goes on to show how technical analysis is flawed and how smart he is to see this so clearly. As the other reviewer noticed, he quickly jumps to conclusion whenever things don't follow his logic. I could list many cases in this book where his very own analysis is flawed, where his arguments are not well constructed, where the next step is avoided whenever the path could lead to a different conclusion.  I have a Theoretical Physics background and the I-know-it-best position that the author shows does not appeal to me either. Most of his humor seems to be based on a deep-seated sense of arrogance.  Yet, he is an intelligent man. One can hardly believe that this is the same person who wrote his other good books, especially the excellent "Innumeracy". Well, they were more in his domain of knowledge.   But he thinks that knowing Mathematics he knows a lot more than he knows, and a lot more than the average Joe. And the market is unforgiving to people who behave like fools and without proper domain knowledge.  I have given two stars to this book because it happens to be an interesting book for people who works with technical analysis. To find the errors and flawed arguments of an intelligent man trying to beat technical analysis is intellectually gratifying.   It may also turn out to be very enlightening to see how the market turns an intelligent man into a fool if proper domain knowledge is missing. It is a lesson that many learn the hard way.  This book probably has a typo in its title.  
 Rather bland and boring; covering overly general neuroscience topics. Many better neuroscience books have been written covering the same material. 
 I first read Desert Sons because of the high ratings, BIG MISTAKE. I had purchased Into This world We're thrown along with Desert Sons, and once I finished Dessert Sons, I left feeling disappointed deeply at how much of the book focused merely on sex, and how predictable the ending was.   To give myself a break, I decided to skip Into this World We're thrown to take a break from such amateur reading. When I came back to it, I wasn't surprised. I finished it very quickly. There wasn't anything confusing about it. It was terribly predictable.   If you're reading books to learn about the gay life, THIS ISN'T WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT! Mark writes on beautiful events that have the POTENTIAL to be great pieces. But without the details they're nothing but unfinished fantasias. Mark is not a developed writer; his writings are very Un-detailed. I'd like to see him write a more descriptive piece, write something that touches us on levels other that what happens physically.   It seems that Mark limits his characters to what he would consider to be a great person, but these characters seem to be stereotypes, people without deep thought, very immature. Now don't get me wrong, he does address some great issues, and things about the gay life that others might not know about, but I don't feel he does a good job at expressing in detail.   One of the things that disturb me most is how he portrays other characters. He'll make certain people be the "bad guy", and I know that every story usually has a bad guy, but I think that he does a bad job at making people with disadvantages be the bad guy here. For instance, in this story is a boy who was a victim of sexual abuse, even though he turns out to be a jerk Mark doesn't seem to show any compassion on the character. Instead he'll subject the character to the stereotypes, and forever label the character as bad. Just because he was a victim, and he's a jerk, doesn't mean he's heartless, but that's just my opinion. And of coarse he always makes the bad guys have something bad happen to them. But the main character (who makes mistakes just as bad) perfect, without flaw or any bad instances happen to him. He's an angel.   I'm sure this book means a lot to Mark, but it will mean nothing to the reader if he doesn't show us how wonderful it really is. I'm very disappointed with Mark Kendrick's book. It's not my favorite and if you read other novels I'm sure you'll automatically see a huge difference from this author compared to others. 
 I bought an Extreme Card for my G4 from ameris and it was faulty didn't load and wouldn't let the computer come on.  Sent a note on the feedback and didn't get any response.  Looks like I will have to eat the card and the cost.  Not very happy with the vendor that amazon let sell the product on their site 
 I've enjoyed the Inspector Banks series in the past (particularly "Final Account" which had a great twist in the last few pages), but "Innocent Graves" is all talk and very little pay-off.  Banks himself continues to be an interesting character, and Robinson's writing is never less than superb, but this particular mystery was a big "who cares?" for me.  The mystery itself isn't really much of a mystery and its solution has more to do with blind luck and a piece of evidence that just happens to appear, like a deus ex machina at the last moment, than it does with any brilliant deduction on Banks's part.  "Innocent Graves" seems far more interested in the psychology of the suspects (one in particular, whose story concludes in an all too predictable fashion) than in satisfying its readers with a great solution to the crime.  I've always found this kind of mystery a bit of a bore; give me a couple of corpses and some brilliant twists and I'm happy.  There are a couple of corpses here, but no twist; just a far too unbelievable and uninteresting ending 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 This book is a mishmash of banal trivialities alternating with the author's relentless self-aggrandizement. Don't waste your money 
 I purchased this movie because it said that those who purchased Love's Enduring Promise also purchased this movie.  Was I ever disappointed.  I was not prepared for the content of them sleeping together before being married.  I had purchased this for my 14 year old daughter.  She also was very disappointed.  I replaced her Christmas present with another, more appropriate movie and I am distroying this movie so that no one in my home will ever have the opportunity to view it again 
 Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of "drove there-wore this-ate that" sequences that leave us wanting. Stephen Cannel plus clothing descriptions 
 I first read A WALKER IN THE CITY as an adolescent, and the book impressed me, in that mysterious way that things that we know "should" impress us can do.  I re-read WALKER as an adult and, by modern standards, I think that it is overrated.  It is long and rambling and self-indulgent.  By rights, A WALKER IN THE CITY should have resonated for me, since my own father had grown up in Brownsville, exactly the same neighborhood that author Alfred Kazin describes, and at virtually the same time.  Yet I found little about Brownsville in this dreary memoir; it simply explores the rather maudlin sentiments of the young Kazin. Swifty Lazar, the late literary agent who was renowned for representing men of letters, as opposed to being a man of letters himself, had offered a far more compelling description of life in that same Brownsville in his own memoir.  No, WALKER only is about Kazin and his adolescent imagination, his theories about those who lived in places other than Brownsville (to wit, "the city") and about his personal (and intensely idiosynchratic, if not peculiar) yearnings.  There are points in which he uses Yiddish without offering a translation, and even a section in which he lapses into high-school French, again with no translation. His use of language often seems strained and self-conscious, such as using the word "plash" as--I think--a synonym for "splash."  Insofar as much of the book had been printed in contemporary magazines as essays, the format here has cobbled together several essays into a memoir. In consequence, this memoir could have used better editing, since things that are fully explained on their first mention do not need the identical explanations further into the book; such styling would be reasonable in a series of magazine pieces, but not in a volume offered as a cohesive work.  I cannot help wondering whether A WALKER IN THE CITY, first published in 1946, would be as enthusiastically received if it first saw print today. It strikes me as the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap "shocks" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry "Mom!" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major dispointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all 
 I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere.  I also got the feeling that because Brooke Shields suffered PPD, she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it.  I'm sorry but I don't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much.  There are unfortunately millions of people who are poor, without health insurance, and worse without support of family and friends, that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness.  No one cares about them.  That is the saddest fact about depression in this country.    However Brooke Shields had millions of dollars to pay for help, a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it, a career that people would die for (her lack of talent doesn't seem to have affected her career much), and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out.  She also had a doctor calling her every day which I've never heard of before!  Try being without all those things when you're suffering depression.  Trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather.  I was a bit annoyed that Brooke Shields was oblivious to all this in her book.  And Tom Cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications.  I admire Tom Cruise - he is certainly far more talented than Brooke and I believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything.  However he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about!!!!  The book's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author, so it's hard to get much out of it.  This book only sold because it was about Brooke Shields 
  	Picture this, you're a regular kid, trying to make friends and fit in, and the way you do it is by committing a robbery. That isn't the smartest thing to do, now is it? You decide that it won't be a big deal if you just "look out" while your new friends do the real robbery part. Then, your plan backfires completely on you and you end up in jail. This is what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myer's novel titled Monster. This book is a realistic fiction novel and not a very difficult read. Walter Dean Myers does an amazing job of showing what Steve is like. He makes Steve an easy character to relate to by making him like any other kid. That's just until Steve gets put into jail!  This book is written as an autobiography that the main character writes...while doing time in jail. Why did Steve end up in jail? Simply because he was the look out of a robbery? Nope, you have to read the book to figure out with specifics! I would recommend this book to almost any type of readers of all ages. Especially for people like me that enjoy reading Walter Dean Myer's work. It is written fantastically and I think could be one of Walter Dean Myer's best!

 This is by far the worst hoover cleaner I have ever owned and I have had many over a long time span. After ten minutes or so the broom motor heats up and you have to wait at least twenty minutes for it to cool down so you can start using it again. I have never had this happen with any other Hoover electric broom, so I called Hoover and they said that this model is only meant to be used 20 MINUTES PER WEEK and only for quick pickups. No where does their literature say this on the box or in the manual inside the box. This product is a completely useless item if you want to use it on a daily basis. I purchased it for bare floors, not carpet, yet it has a rolling brush for carpet use. The box says is provides "effective carpet and bare flooring cleaning, " but they don't tell you it can only be used for 20 minutes a week as I was told by their customer service rep. Poor product from a company I always trusted 
 I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I picked this book up, because I'm interested in getting a high level overview of Nietzsche. The title read Very Short Introduction, so I assumed it would be a great starting point to figure out if I would want to dive into some of Nietzsche complete works and study him over time. Now, I'm not an English major, but I do hold a Masters degree, so I am educated. I found this book terrible in communicating its point. Yes, Tanner has a wonderful command of the English language, but does his book really need to require a dictionary to read? It's almost as if he ran it through a software thesaurus that converted every word to the most obscure word he could possibly use. Yes, Mr. Tanner your language is impressive, but if the average reader, like me, can't understand you then what's the point? Keep it simple; always use the simplest most widely used words to communicate the point. Anything else is just egotistical in my opinion 
 The first book in the series, City of Ember, is brilliant.  The second book, People of Sparks, is still interesting, although it does not live up to its full potential.  The Prophet of Yonwood, a prequel to City of Ember, is completely dull.  It takes so long to get to the point (the point being how Ember becomes Ember and exactly what has happened, etc.) that I rushed through all the pages to find that there are only 2 pages at the very end to connect the plot in Yonwood to Ember.  It's so disappointing because I was earnestly hoping that all the details and mysteries that are just hinted in the City of Ember would be unraveled in Yonwood 
 This could have been an excellent study into the characteristics of manhood set by culture, society, environment, and nature. Instead it is a terribly limited view of a handful of men in one country. Sadly, it is void of enthusiasm for its topic, boring as dirt, and less interesting than reading a phone book.The author seems more intent on proving he has read a great deal on the topic by endlessly paraphrasing the work of other studies (always giving due credit), but displays little skill in using his knowledge to make his viewpoints or research remotely appealing 
 Recovering drug addict William Cope Moyers is the son of award winning journalist Bill Moyers.  And he won't let you forget it. Although the first few pages of his memoir, an account  of his parents tracking him down in an Atlanta crack house after a six-day drug binge, are compelling, the following section, his recollections from childhood up to the binge, is downright boring.  It tells of an over-privileged kid of below average intelligence (ranked 210 out of 487 in high school) and uses amateurish phrases like, "My most painful memory isn't even something I can remember," icing on a cake is described as so rich that, "the sugar crunched like sand between your teeth," and after drinking, "my bladder was stretched like a water balloon."  Seemingly ordinary childhood behaviors are given special significance as precursors to his addiction, like his kindergarten teacher's report card comment that he, "shouldn't talk out in the classroom whenever he wants," first grade, "needs improvement in exercising self-control," and, of schoolmates "kids would tease me and make up little taunting phrases."   He name drops (sometimes repeatedly) feeling compelled to share the fact that he has met folks like Mike Wallace, Fidel Castro, Dan Rather, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Paul McCartney, and Bill Clinton; toots his own horn, recounting a story of his bravery in helping firefighters rescue two people from a burning building, even including the letter of commendation he received from the local chief of police; and places self-deserved blame squarely on the shoulders of others, during a night of college drinking, "the bartender should have stopped serving me when it was obvious I was drunk," of his father's post college graduation letter, "I wonder how my life might have been different if my father had insisted I get professional help," on his first wife showing up to visit after his stint in Hazelden, during which he began an inappropriate relationship with (and later married) another resident, "after refusing to go to the family session together...here she was getting in the way of my new relationship." Ultimately he divorces, remarries, has children and gets a job that allows him to do something he is good at, helping raise awareness and affecting addiction-related public policy.   His most telling quote, "I always felt that I had the unfair advantage of being Bill Moyer's son," will cause many to think, "You did!" Although the writing in the last half of the book, especially that dealing with his four relapses and struggle to remain sober (which will ring true to anyone who has experience with addicts or addiction), is an improvement over the first half, the letters and notes from family members and acquaintances and rehashed journal entries that he includes detract from the overall story. Frey's lies (A Million Little Pieces), prefaced with the phrase, "Based on a true story," are much better written and were published without help from a famous father. Anyone interested in reading a memoir about how alcoholism (and poverty) affects a family, would enjoy The Glass Castle (good) and Angela's Ashes (great). 
 I love literature.  I respect books.  I only destroy a book because;  1.) I feel like the author cheated me, or  2.) To keep it from falling into the hands of someone else so desperate for something to read that they'll pick up ANYTHING.  This one went directly into the dumpster for both reasons 
 I hate to write a critical review, since any book is a work of love and dedication.  But for scientists as myself, I would tread carefully, dear reader.  For example, consider Fig. 2 and 3 on pg's 150 and 151.  Fig. 2 shows the brain with regions delineated by 5 patterns (dots, dashes, white, etc.).  OK so far, but there is no graphical legend to the patterns.  And in the textual legend the author refers to "the cross-hatched area."  I submit no x-hatched area exists in this Figure.  (Maybe a zazen test?)  Being human, I forgive one error.  Now, on to Fig. 3.  Nice picture.  But read this part of the legend.  "The long cingulate gyrus receives extensive thalamic projections from the anterior thalamic nucleus (not indicated)."  What I describe is a figure legend describing something not indicated in the Figure. In 54 years (OK, I have only been reading since age 3 or 4, so in the last 50 years of reading), I have never before seen such an example.  Did the MIT Press really read and edit this text?  Respectfully yours, 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 i've had farts sound funnier than this hack. and yes i sit around and smell them, but its more mind stimulating than listening to a fake mexican talk about how controversial he's about to be and TELL IT LIKE IT IZ when he just says black people eat chicken. really carlos? do they really 
 When I first looked at the title, I thought,"wow, someone has a great understanding of the movement from the Shoalin to other places of Asia, and eventually America."  But that was not the case.  I feel that the title is misleading, for it hardly describes that at all.  The author i felt was way to bias to his style of martial arts, not only, the original forms created in the Shoalin temple.  His agruments is basically that all martial artists should learn the traditional Shoalin forms for they hold "special meaning," or that they were created for a "better purpose."  In other words, no one must forget them.  This is a kind of contradiction to the buddhist thought which is change is inevitable.  I have a question, if the purpose of forms a state of focus, a state of meditation, and phyical training, than does it matter what form we as martial artis do?  I feel that he is trying too hard to promote his style he trains.  Had some good concepts in the book, but the rest has nothing to do with the title, therefore, i feel you need to retitle it.  My opinion,  Also i found many other things that seemed contratictory to the taoist, buddhist and zen thought, but i will let everyone else figure that out themselves 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing.  She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well.  Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding.  It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt.  So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt.  Do the math 
 I had a hard time finishing this book. The characters were all created nicely, but the book bored me, the end was just too bland, nothing shocking, and no resolution for the reader. I won't read any more of his books. 
 Be carefull, make sure this is the upgraded unit, that came out recently. No reason to buy the old original one, because of many flaws in design. 
 the dvd didn't work and returning it couldn't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes 
 I didn't really care for this toy and felt it wasn't really represented properly in its description.  My grandaughter found it boring 
 While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.  I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.  The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.  Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.  I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy 
 Don't waste your money on this one.  Very poorly written.  This appears to be a magazine article that was expanded into a book with a bunch of glowing quotes about Unitas and then added 40 pages of stats, some photos without captions, three forwards and an afterword.  As a n alternative, run a google search for Unitas, read the first few hits, and you will know more about Johny U in a few minutes from running the search - than you would learn from wasting your time reading this paperweight. 
 Walter Russell Mead had the unfortunate timing to publish one of the best new books on U.S. foreign relations just as 9/11 changed the American security landscape forever. His remarkable "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and how it changed the World" hit bookstands around the country within weeks of Al Qaeda's attack. The work, which was part revisionist history and part typology of U.S. foreign policy traditions, had everything going for it except one thing: it called for an American global pullback, and cautioned against international overreaching, just as 9/11 ensured the U.S. would be extending itself around the world with a vengeance. What's a talented foreign policy specialist to do? Why not write another book?  The result is something of a disappointment. "Power, Terror, Peace, and War: America's Grand Strategy in a World at Risk" feels rushed and light. Weighing in at just over 200 pages, and with no bibliography, the book is thin in both original thinking and scholarship. Mead obviously felt he had to say something about 9/11 without delay. He should have taken his time. Where "Special Providence" had much that was useful and interesting, even after events had overtaken its conclusion, this book is likely to sink out of view without a whimper. Comparing the two books is an object lesson to authors who believe that topicality is of primary importance to the quality of their book.  A problem of Mead's that was not apparent in reading just one of his books, but which appears with more clarity after reading two of them, is his addiction to classification systems. His four part typology of American foreign policy -- Jeffersonians, Hamiltonians, Wilsonians, and Jacksonians -- is the centerpiece of "Special Providence." In "Power, Terror, Peace, and War", he comes up with a three-part division of sharp power (military), sticky power (economic), and sweet power (cultural), because he apparently wasn't satisfied with the traditional dichotomy of hard and soft power. He also speaks of Fordism and millennial capitalism, hegemonic power and harmonic convergence, and he reprises his classification of Jeffersonians, Hamiltonians, Wilsonians, and Jacksonians from the previous book. Not all of these terms are Mead's creations, but most of them are, and the result is the book has a strained quality to it. Even informed readers might feel a little at sea when contemplating ideas such as whether revivalist Hamiltonians' post-Fordist strategy of sticky power helps America's harmonic convergence.  (Mead doesn't actually say that word for word, but it sometimes feels like he wants to.)  Despite this compulsive desire to come up with neologisms, Mead says very little that is interesting or new. In "Special Providence", he changed the way I thought about U.S. foreign policy in the nineteenth century. This book, on the other hand, is instantly forgettable. Mead makes general comments on economics that are weakly supported (how does Mead know whether millennial capitalism is here to stay?) and throwaway remarks on current events which were already dated by the time the book was published. Rather than waste your time with this work, I recommend reading his "Special Providence", a superior book in every way 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
 ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)      ((( Insert this every other sentence! )))     figuring out the problem is not hard, its admitting it.     ( hint, dont kneejerk and yell hate and sexist, this is a woman writing, who stays home with the kids and whose own mom stayed home with the kids, rem those days?  the 60's?  oh gee why has everything changed?!  you know the answer, just admit it.      A sense of community  We know all about the women who live along Wisteria Lane, but not what's going on with the people who live on our own street. We instant message with strangers around the world while hardly talking to the neighbor next door. We know the middle names of celebrity children, though we have no idea who the kid across the street is.   It's the American way, or perhaps the demise of the American way.   Fewer people know their neighbors, a decline that's been occurring since the late 1960s, according to the book "Better Together: Restoring the American Community," (Simon & Schuster, $15, 336 pages) by Robert Putnam and Lewis Feldstein.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Since that time, social clubs, civic associations, participation in public affairs and time spent with family, friends and neighbors have all dropped by 25 percent to 50 percent, according to the book.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     And the average American has friends over to dinner about 45 percent less than in the 1970s, according to another of Putnam's books, "Bowling Alone" (Simon & Schuster, $16 paperback, 554 pages).   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     "It does seem to be the kind of thing we have lodged in the collective imagination where the Cleaver family has barbecues with the neighbors," says Kevin Wehr, an assistant professor of sociology at California State University, Sacramento. "That just seems to be not really the case anymore."   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     Busy schedules, a more transient society all contribute to declining neighborliness, experts have found.   ( women have left the home and family and gone to work!)     
 but this one I had no trouble parting with.  I purchased this book shortly after it was released, long before General Clark made his bid for the Democratic nomination.  I've tried to complete it twice, but cannot bear to finish it.   It's just too much celebration of General Clark and not enough discussion of events in  his life or the the context of those events.  It's a dissapointment , because General Clark is obviously intelligent, and has the resume to provide an interesting read 
 I am a big fan of Kurt Russell but this movie sucks. And as Forrest Gump said, "thats all I have to say about that. 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 Where in the world is the 2nd Disc to the Tarzan Special Edition I was told about in the commerical? This is complete false advertisement. I bought this DVD thinking there where 2-Discs. Disney really messed up on this one. They need to send all owner's of this crappy So-called Special Edition a free copy of the next Tarzan release(which will probably be a 2 Disc DVD) or refund unsatisfied customers money back. I will think twice about buying certain Disney movies in the future.    I am also upset about the "New Groove Edtion" of The Emperor's New Groove. This is for the most part the same DVD as the previous released. Down to the content and even the menus. The only thing really new is 2 more deleted scenes.  I am totally upset about this situation. I can not return these DVD's to the store because the DVD's are opened. The only way I could know this was not what I wanted was to open the DVD's. As a customer what do you do when the stores have a no return policy on open DVD's.  Total Disappointment 
 This book is written as if it is a parody of a new age self-help book. I simply can't believe that any intelligent person would take it seriously. I heard of the poem and it is sort of nice in a new agey way. The book, which I looked at in a bookstore, is just laughable. Come on, people 
 John Fowles is a talented writer, and I think that if you end up buying this book, you will not be disappointed. It has some interesting points in  it. Many deep thoughts, some interesting chapters. But, the problem is that  I don't think that the story of "Daniel Martin" is a good one. It  is not fascinating, atleast it didn't raise my interest. At some point I  started to dislike this Daniel Martin.. He seemed boring and dull, just  like any stupid, chauvinistic, self-centered, egoistic middle-aged man you  can see. Maybe there is a point in describing a person like that, but  frankly: I am not very thrilled to read about a man like that, I think I've  met too many "daniel martins" in real life 
 As a holder of a doctoral degree myself, from the University of Washington, and having had additional training on fellowship at Stanford University, [...]  In his writing, Wood never takes a breath, or any other pause for serious reflection.  He manifests no rational evaluation of competing thoughts on any page of the text; he merely spews a haphazard series of diatribes.  Wood provides no new insights, but merely repeats Fawn Brodie's outdated and questionable citations to the 19th-century equivalents of National Enquirer sources.    Wood's fiery accusations provide dim light, at best 
 Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child.  This gate is all look and no function.  It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it.  If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work.  I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together.  I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6" then drilling two holes about 4" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something.  Good luck!! 
 THe complete fat flush program is an impossibility for most. The time it takes to shop for, prepare, and consume would be a full time job. Not to mention that you are suppose to drop everything to search out all "organic" meats, veggies and even juice! I did learn some interesting facts about how to increase bile production.  Just add some lemon to your water, cut back on your portions and enjoy life 
 First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar.   But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet.   However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking. 
 Just another wanna be somebody, using the tired old trodge stuff. Like a previous bright lad said, `Heresay`. Wonder why they don`t consider self immolation to get attention....now THAT would be worth reading about. AND we could bring chestnuts. As for George nicking somebody elses song....oh dear. And of course, the only place that the Beatles went, was america. Typical yank author..two places in the world. america and notamerica. Toilet paper might work if the ink isn`t as cheap as the scribbler. Not worth a zac.  BTW the software advised that I HAD to award this crud with at least one star or the review would not get posted...hence the one star where I gave it minus 5 stars (idea would be to give us a choice of bouquets or brickbats doncha think??) 
 I read this book,a couple years back and was somewhat skeptical,initially. I wondered if just measuring brain metabolism in certain areas can really give you a full picture of whats going on. Still,other parts of the book seemed to contain good advice and insights. After some discussion with family, I decided what the hell,and went ahead and got the pricey standard workup at the Amen Clinic, 2 SPECT scans, etc. Keep in mind that insurance does not cover this, at least not in my experience. The clinic was reasonably professional,although Dr Amen himself came off as quite pompous. He's also quite short,about 5'4. The prescriptions I was given did not make much difference in the 2-3 months I was on them. To get them renewed I would have had to travel a long distance back to the expensive Amen Clinic. My local pdoc did not have much respect for Dr. Amens reccomendations,(which I understand now)so in the end,it was a big waste. I later found out Dr Amen is a fundamentalist Christian,and is a fan of Pat Robertson. It didnt surprise me, as he didnt come off as a very tolerant person. I suggest you do a google search on "Dr. Amen" + "quack" to at least see both sides of the story. Im sure he has helped some people with SPECT,but in my case it was like throwing money down the drain. 
 this book is about HARDY euphorbias (E), those that can be grown in a temperate garden. (Succulent enthusiasts be warned- not for you!) the 1st 2 or 3 chapters are of interest to any gardener but then to get into the meat  of the book one needs some familiarity with botany & botanical  terminology;  What should be the most interesting part of the book- the A-Z  of hardy E.in cultivation- is far too full of irritating detail useful only  to the E. specialist & would not be usable (except by such enthusiasts)  for the identification of an unknown species. There are 16 pages of  beautiful photos of some 40 different species but,surprisingly, there is no  reference to the text and when one does look up a particular plant there is  noreference in the text to the photo. there are also some 20 line drawings  shown in the list of contents but there is no indication of which page  carries which drawing!  only to be recommended to E. enthusiast 
 Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.  It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.  I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)  It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.   
 I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play 
 4 ingredients:  Flour in a bowl (maybe 4 cups); some milk (maybe 3 cups); some water (maybe less than 3 cups) (gin per Ellen) and probably fast acting yeast in liquid form.  Mix by hand and leave alone for a while for the dough to rise (1/2 hour).  Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to probably less than 1/2".  Use a standard tin can (the size that Campbell's chicken noodle soup or diced tomatoes, veggies, etc. come in) and cut out the biscuits.  Then they are brushed with melted butter and go into probably a 350 deg oven until done.  The dough bisquits are adjacent to each other so when the baking sheet comes out it is one giant biscuit nicely browned.  But who really knows what the flour was pre-seasoned with or if all the ingredients were telecast due to time restraints.  You can match this against traditional southern biscuits and probably get a better idea of ingredients and quantity.  I need a southern fried chicken receipe for my new Lodge cast iron 3 qt lidded chicken fryer.  The Loveless web site has a quicktime movie and this time Carol Faye mentions adding grease (lard? or Crisco?) and the baking time is 10 minutes.  I am now inclined to increase the flour to 8 cups and the milk and water(?) to 4-5 cups each 
 I was required to use ALWD's Citation System in law school, in part because one of the professors is a member. However, as I do not work around any of the Courts that use it (e.g. 11th Cir., Montana, the Marshall Islands), then it is absolutely useless.  Everybody else uses Blue Book, and that system is not that hard to learn. Look, if a law student can't learn Blue Book and needs a dumbed down system like ALWD, then they should reconsider their career choice.  However, I assume that the reason why you're buying this is because you have to. Good luck. I found it to be of marginal assistance when I had to use it 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 Would work great, except...this doesn't fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100).  
 This has to be one of the worst productions in the history of music.  There comes a time when a person should really take a long, hard look to see if it is time to hang it up. For Babs, that time has come.  The good thing is that I have the answer to her introspective undertaking - STOP SINGING NOW!!  
 Don't waste you money on this one. To many opinions in the first two chapters turned me off right away. I continued on to find most of the book is about stamp technology. The chapters could have dealt with one topic at a time rather than just touching on various things. Theres alot of information but its rather bombarding to someone who is tring to learn. Its too many ideas to study as once, it does make a fine reference for the bookshelf. But not practical to learn with 
 In the worlds time of crisis you have to show your true colors!!!!! Go to HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Hi.  I bought this product expect a bright laser because of other reviews.  Not only was this laser bright, it hurt my eyes to look at the dot it made!  How ever, this laser ran out of batteries after 3 days of use and a week later it broke!  Some of the wiring inside it has gone faulting and I have to tilt it a direction to get it to work.  Not only that but from 6 feet away the dot is the size of an apple!!! -unhappy customer.  *Good shipping speed though  and I would be glad to buy a better product from the seller 
 I've been following DBB for a few years now. I bought this album after admiring the other live album "ROWDY DOWDY" (which was incredible). But unfortunately "RELEASE THE GREASE" fails to convey the band's tremendous energy onstage. The sound quality is not the best (as is often an issues with live albums) and die-hard fans of Jen's renditions of the earlier songs may be disappointed - this album lacks some of the earlier albums' funky grit. If you want to hear DBB live - SEE A SHOW!!! - or purchase "ROWDY DOWDY"... but pass on this album 
 If you like books that feed dissallusionment then this book is for you.  If you want to read a book that will give your hopelessness a legalistic edge it is a must.  I am sorry to say that as much as I enjoyed some of Edwards other books example "A tale of Three Kings", this one was a huge dissapointment.  It is written with an "elitist" edge that I find disturbing.  Thank God that the Holy Spirit can use anyone or any method He desires! Mike Brown's "Revolution in the Church", and Wolfgang Simpsons, "Houses that change the World" are 20 times better 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 ....the ultimo movie about a bungled heist job and the crooks are holed out somewheres is....Reservior Dogs. This has great actors in it...I enjoyed seeing, f'instance, Dame Dunaway...but, she, Sinise, Dillon, Mantegna, and perpetual co-lister Faison had a poor dialog to work with. Imagine if QT had written it. Or, my favorite tough guy screenwriter, David Mamet. Fortunately though, Spacey will have something to build on develop a director's repertoire.. 
 While Liz Greene has a smooth writing style, it is unfortunate that it  has not been put to more constructive use.  She identifies some of the key characteristics of Neptune, but views them in an almost entirely negative light.  What is worse, her descriptions of "Neptunian" people and problems are done in a  condescending and belittling manner.  Although she dismisses much religion and spirituality as Neptunian phenomena in a negative sense, her book offers no viable alternatives.  There are few constructive suggestions given in this book for the supposed weaknesses of those with hard aspects to Neptune in their charts.  Reading this book might lead some "Neptunian" people to think of themselves as being problematic and of little use to society, and could do more harm than good in many cases 
 The book does give great interviews and words of Vonnegut, but there is no substantial whole.  It is poorly laid out, and makes no concrete assertions or comments on Vonnegut's words 
 I am unsure if this book is available in English trans from someone other than Ed Vit. and Mondial book publishers, but there are several mistakes in translation that are more oversights and bad editing than any real translational problem between English/French. As well, there is an entire section in which the translator removed a description of Zola's, because he thinks the English audience wouldn't be interested. Incase he's reading this, I was interested. Zola is an excellent observer, that's part of the charm of his writing, his fabulous descriptions that allow the reader to nearly take part in an event for which they were not present, the descriptions are so detailed and interesting. To have instead an astrisk by Ed telling me at the bottom of the page that my sentiments couldn't take the brutal description...if there isn't a new translation, there needs to be one and a better edited version too!   That said, of course, even shoddy trans and editing mistakes can't ruin Zola. I am half way through and just like all others this novel immediately presents great characters that make you curious for more and keep you hooked until the end!!    
 Very simplistic treatment, with some results left for the reader to work through exercises.  The chapters are almost non-existent, with all the book being mainly exercises 
 Maya Angelou is an expert at writing easily remembered catchphrases and proverbial tidbits that have all the taste of wisdom with half the calories.  She fills her fans with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, she inspires them, she makes them feel as if she speaks The Truth.  In other words, she's great at writing motivational proverbs.  She is not, however, a poet.  Not even close.  She displays virtually no poetic craft and shows no real skill at compression, imagery, figurative language, and metaphor, to name a few tools that make a piece of writing a poem.  At best, this collection would bore the pants off of any serious reader of poetry.  At worst, it will make them want to gouge their eyes out with a pair of #6 knitting needles.  If you think this is poetry, you haven't read any poetry yet 
 This is by far the worst editing I have seen.  You will enjoy if you suffer from schizophrenia or suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, since no single video clip lasts for more than 1 second.  Had this series been produced as a traditional documentary it would have been fascinating, but so much for that idea.  I sat through three episodes before I could no longer stand it and turned it off.  Thank God it was a rental.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD 1) you will regret it and 2) you will always here me saying "I told you so! 
 In this self-aggrandizing attempt to position the Braves as the most successful franchise of the past 100 years of baseball, Schuerholz offers very little insight on how to run a successful franchise and instead focuses on stories that leave you saying in the end, "who cares."    The book at times feels like it is being written on a 4th-grade reading level and I could not in good conscious recommend it to any baseball fan. 
 I bought this text for additional tutorial help and insight into an HVAC class I am currently taking.  Unfortunately, this is not a 'summary' or 'reference,' nor is a 'thorough background' presented.  This is a work-book, full of work-sheets.  There are not even any answers to the myriad questions provided.  If you are trying to learn the material being covered this will not help you.  The text only asks questions you don't know the answers to because you bought the wrong book 
 This is something I would find on a humor website. And it's not very good. Most of the jobs listed is only held by a few people and not what I call real jobs. There is a show on The Discovery Channel that is titled "Dirty Jobs". One job that Racz mentions was featured on it. Chicken sexer. And what the job is about is quickly finding out what sex the baby chicks are. But he mentions silly stuff mostly like Saddam Hussein Double and Exorcist. A few real ones like Data Entry and Shopping Cart Valet.   I got this book from the library by placing it on hold. If I saw the inside of this book I wouldn't have bothered with it.  
 I Personally cannot stand George Michael's voice and the claims people make that he sounds closest to Freddie is absurd.  The Freddie Mercury Tribute is a great cause.. and this made lots of money.  But George  Michael, IN MY OPINION, cannot sing 
 The only useful thing about this infuriating -- and inaccurate-- book is the selection of photos.  Otherwise, get Dunning 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 i dont have this item, but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is $100 and they are selling it for $2.50!!! 
 on this book, unless you wish to follow the mindless politically correct rewritten version of history that you find pretty much everywhere these days.  I am a teacher, a historian, and a woman whose ancestors fought proudly for the Union Army.  That said, I recognize this book for what it is.  If you're really looking for something historically accurate, then you would better spend your money on books which detail - even for this age group - the War Between the States in much more realistic and honest terms.  They are out there.  Though I'm not quite as passionate as some of the reviewers below, I agree with their sentiment entirely.  This book is simply fluff with almost no historical value - actually, it's worse than that, because it does perpetuate false stereotypes.  It's especially bad because it's done in the guise of educational fiction.  Shame on Scholastic 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 There's very little in this book you couldn't learn from one of the free PDF downloads on the Daily Racing Form website.  It's an introduction to what happens in and around the track that doesn't help you at all with learning how to handicap.  Strictly lowest common denominator stuff, nothing that will help you think for yourself at the track.  You'd be better off picking up a copy of Brad Free's brilliant Handicapping 101 instead-- This one falls far below the usual Dummies standards 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 If you're looking forward to being entertained by reading a good novel, by all means buy this book.  If on the other hand; you're looking for facts... don't waste your money (and time) on this work of fiction 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
       This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.  
 This is Hemingway's worst book.  It's hard to know if he was going for the "titillation factor" or if he was simply this jaded, cynical and without compassion.  If "three ways" thrill you, this is your Hemingway book; otherwise, it simply illustrates how superficial and careless he could be -- and his writing in this one is pitiful 
 I read somewhere that a vacuum or hairdryer could soothe a screaming baby.  I was at my wit's end and tried both.  My baby would stop crying as soon as I turn either on.  The vacuum would even put him to sleep.  However, living in an apartment complex with neighbors that go to bed early, I couldnt use these things at night.  I saw this CD and figured it would be the answer to my prayers.  The sounds, though, are not the same. When I play the CD the only reaction I get from my baby, if I even get one,is he looks at me funny and screams even louder.  The hairdryer is ear piercing and the vacuum is just wrong.  I have even tried to adjust the volume from low to louder than my vacuum.  Nothing works.  BUYERS BEWARE!! 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 O cd do alexandre  pirata. veio com a faixa 1 do filme era tocada pelo black crowes. eu gosto de gosta de ouvir village people de madrugada.... 
 I had ordered a few tapes which were fine.  However this one was shipped and received w/ a broken plastic jacket... 
 ...HE HAS TO SHOW HIS ''THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE'' FACE ON THE COVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bob is no musical genius (no ''O'' in genius,people !!!!!!!!) but he is a genius exploiter.he duped a generation of hippies into believing his junk.its been said before,put some other drunk guys name on any of bobs cds and not one person would buy it.except for tom waits but that goes without saying 
 I was left with the feeling that all of this has been said before in one form or another, Where it was ' new' there are other who have already explored the space ( eg The Suport Economy by Shoshana Zuboff)  There are two many big words hidding little concepts. The case studies are simplistic  and look to the past rather than casting light on the future. This will be another 'fad" and like all fads find its place in the dustbins of business book 
 I'm a big fan of well written adventure books and books on natural history. The best of them transcend their subject matter to arrive at bigger truths about human nature, the world, and mankind's place in it. Sy Montgomery tries mightily to link her experience up with The Bigger Story, but never manages to do it. Her attempts to be profound become almost embarrassing after a while.    Sy writes a nature column for the Boston Globe and it shows. Everything of interest she has to say in this book could have been said in a column or two. What she's done in this book is take that column and simply keep repeating it over and over and over. Thus we hear narrative after narrative from the locals about how the bufeo live in an enchanted underwater city and come up on land periodically to seduce women. We spend day after day in a boat with her exclaiming "There's one! And there's another one!" After a while I found myself thinking "Sy, you go out in the boat and look for the bufeo. I'll lounge here on the hotel veranda and have some refreshments until you get back. Have a nice time."  Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find anything `magical' or particularly poetic about her descriptions of the environment. It's not that she's a bad writer - clearly she isn't - but  she describes things the way a columnist would describe an exotic local for readers planning their next vacation - the size of the trees, the depth of the water, the different kinds of plants and bugs and wildlife you may encounter, with some attempt to make it all sound beautiful.   She does give some superficial history of the Amazon Basin,  a little evolutionary history of dolphins, some "highlights" types of descriptions of a couple of towns and villages - everything you need to know to enhance your vacationing experience. She meets a lot of people along the way and dutifully describes the physical appearance of most of them. She tries to instill a little personality in each of them but can't pull it off, so even these encounters take on the quality of "And then I met this tanned woman wearing khaki shorts who was interested in manatees."  In the end, we have gone on a trip with Sy and visited a local market or two,  admired the opera house at Manaus, caught some glimpses of the pink dolphins, listened to various natives tell the same legend, went to the funeral of a drowned child, dodged a snake or two,  and got sweaty in the jungle. If you had any interest in pink dolphins before you started the book, you'll be over it by the time this trip ends 
 What a "piece of work" this was.  Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT "the bomb" ;).  It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience.  There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book.  Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one 
 WOW,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!! NOT EVEN ONE GOOD SCENE IN THIS HUGE MESS ABOUT DIAMONDS ,KILLER APES,AND GREED! EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS SHOULD SAY THEIR SORRY!!!! THE PITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SKIP THIS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Although this book received glowing reviews on the back jacket from the likes of Vincent Cannistraro and Robert Gates it is not only dull but offers little or no new information. The book is further marred by a lack  of footnotes, putting a serious dent in the author's credibility. For  example, Laqueur states in one chapter that a right-wing racist group in  the US managed to obtain Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. This is something  I would have like to check out but could not, because there were no  footnotes. Even worse, contrary to the title of the book which talks about  weapons of mass destruction, there is very little discussion of how  terrorists would obtain or use weapons of mass destruction. The book reads  like a college text on the ideology of terrorism. Fine for the ivory towers  of academia but of little value in the real world. Save your money, this  book is a dog. I would recommend Jessica Stern's "The Ultimate  Terrorists" or William E. Burrow's "Critical Mass" both make  more interesting reads and both HAVE footnotes. Sorry Walter, better luck  next time 
 I have read hundreds of diet books--but honestly this one is the WORST one EVER!!!  It was so depressing that I had to quit reading it!!! REALLY!!!  I ordered "THE OVERFED HEAD" by Rob Stevens at the same time and it was THE BEST DIET BOOK I've ever read!!! -- thanks to Rob -- it may be the LAST DIET BOOK I'LL EVER READ!!!  Take my advise and buy his book -- he gives great advise!!!  Rob was on a diet for 25 years, but when he STOPPED DIETING -- he lost 150 lbs!!! -- proving diets don't work!!!  The only thing you LOSE on a diet is the money you spent on the diet!!! -- because the weight always comes back -- plus more!!!  Mary   
 I sincerely wish that amazon.com allowed 0 stars.  There were too many "eyerolling" moments in this book, not to mention that the copy editor must have been on vacation.  The plot, which involves a voluptuous woman and ex-rock-and-roll star who get married because of the terms of a will and then begin to fall in love, would have been far more believable if the author would have spent time in story development to make us care about the characters.  This does not happen.  Consequently, the characters come off as simply unbelievable and cliche-ish.  Save your money and pass on this book 
 I find it ironic, that the major issue in the world today is the Israeli-Palestinian problem, but the majority of anti-semite, anti-islam books are written by Christians. With the exception of Dore Gold, and Daniel Pipes 
 I did not like most of the recepies that were in the book.  They were too exotic for me.  A couple of the desert recepies were ok and I did like the color pages that showed the food.  
 "How To" books always get my hopes up, and I did hope to find a nice, solid path to playing the piano. Not concert level, just enough to get by. While I think the explanations are good, and it moves sequentially, I have to agree with my husband that despite following instructions, I didn't fill the house with joyous noise. Just noise.  So I intend toget out there,  just bite the bullett and find a teacher, and let him or her actually show me how, listen to me, and tell me when I've finally "got it." Maybe that's the thing missing that only a teacher can do--that a book just cant: listen to you and keep what's good and fix what's wrong. Well written, typical for Evans. But maybe more than a book alone can hope to accomplish. Will let you know after I find a teacher. Now, what's the best way to find a teacher?? 
 Save your money. These authors have better to offer, as does the science collective as a whole. Look elsewhere for insightful musings 
 I was given three months to read this book, and each time I picked it up I threw it down in disgust.  Between the none-stop Johnny Appleseed referances to the Collegian's Guide to Growing Pot, it is amazing I got through it.  I am convinced he was once a Columbian drug lord 
 This book makes some decent statements. However, Korten goes way overboard on his assault, and in doing so ends up "throwing the baby out with the bath water".  What I wish Korten would write is "WARNING - if we are not careful, corporations and the short term goals that they inspire CAN and WILL ruin not only the planet, but your life and life as we know it". But so will any organization that is left unchecked (think of 1984 and/or Brave New World for excessive examples of both). Korten warns that corporations have the potential to be excessive in their quest for greed, and that is true. However, corporations are made of people, and if people decide to give their lives over to greed, then yes, there will be consequences. Korten never really says this, but it is obvious -- life is more than just work, and it is every person's individual responsibility to think about the values of life beyond just simple greed. This means (I think) sharing a healthy passion for improving your position economically in life, but also balancing it with other equally important needs - love, family, friends, environmental balance, love for your neighbor (regardless of territorial boundaries), etc...  Korten's attack on corporations is excessive and looks at the worst case scenario in every sense, and then finds a way to place the blame on business. He tells you about all the people that he has seen misplaced over the years due to terrible economic corporate greed. However, is it just corporations that are at fault here, or could it also be politicians, local police, warlords, lack of execution, or any other things that could have made a situation bad. Korten decides that it is the fault of corporations and leaves it at that.  Korten also likes to talk about all of the failures of capitalist societies and how evil greed and pro business leaders caused all of this pain. I agree with him that there is no government in the world that is perfect, and the US (the leader of corporate society) has many skeletons in the closet of history, but the US history is also one of constant improvement, relentlessly seeking to improve the balance between companies, individuals, and the different elements that make up all of life. The "Robber Barons" was a chapter of US history that was excessive, but it was also one that was ultimately fixed (or balanced), and after this was done the US not only emerged as one of the strongest economic powers, but also a place that immigrants loaded onto boats by the thousands to come to. And yes, this was a CHOICE that they made - no corporation forced them to come.  Korten (as well as the first review of this book) goes into talking about how even Adam Smith was opposed to large corporations. To quote, (page 81) "Smith... opposed any form of economic concentration on the ground that it distorts the market's natural ability to establish a price that provides a fair return on land, labor, and capital". This is incorrect. What Smith opposed was any economic force that led to COLLUSION or MANIPULATION of the markets away from their free workings. Today free market principles are espoused and they should be. When they are not, and often times they are not, we are dependent on the courts and our elected officials to rectify the problem. Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not, but simply saying that corporations are bad (and Adam Smith says so too) is just wrong. Free market capitalism is a work in progress...  I could go on, but I will give one last example of Korten's excess. On page 76, he talks about the beliefs of free market ideologues. He writes "These beliefs are based on a number of explicit, underlying assumptions... (1) Humans are motivated by self interest, which is expressed primarily through the quest for financial gain. (2) The action that yields the greatest financial return to the individual or firm yields the most benefit to society. (3) Competitive behavior is more rational for the individual that cooperative behavior and ultimately more beneficial for society. (4) Human progress and improvements in well-being are best measured by increases in the aggregate market value of economic input."  OK, fair enough - this seems to be a fair statement in general. However, Kurton then puts his EXPERT OPINION on things to work. He then interprets all of this in the next paragraph when he says "To put it in harsher language, these idealogical doctrines assume that: (1) People are by nature motivated only by greed. (2) The drive to acquire is the highest expression of what it means to be human. (3) The relentless pursuit of greed and acquisition lead to socially optimal outcomes. (4) The interests of human societies are best served by encouraging, honoring, and rewarding the above values." This jump to "harsher langauge" is absurd.  Reading this, I just cannot see how Korten is looking at this with any sort of objective lens. To reinterpret the first set of thoughts into the second is just a ridiculous leap and assumes that all people in large corporations must be Gordon Geckos. This type of comparison is made time and time again in this book and is the reason I don't think his arguments can truly hold much weight other that one off examples of corporate ills.  In the end, Korten does have some points. If you, or society, or the world, cannot understand the difference between economic growth and happiness/quality of life, then we are all in trouble. However, I give the world more credit than that. It is not a perfect world to say the least, but just because there are some problems in certain areas, we should not be totally against that area. While throwing out the bathwater of economic growth and improving qualities of life, let's make sure to hold on to the baby that we are trying to take care of 
 I buy most programming books with the expectation that there will be some step by step modules geared toward developing some type of application.  I found nothing of the sort in this book.  I found a lot of code to demonstrate what the author was saying.  I felt the whole book - was geared toward the history and explanation of what various programming components were all about.  I am an accomplished ASP Web/Database Developer and was interested in learning how to write activex components.  I thank the author for wasting my money 
 In terms of vitalism spiritism supernaturalism, I particularly enjoy this line: "the organic foods you eat have a spirit of their own, one that will blend with your spirit and strengthen and empower your vital force [p.354]."  This one is good too:  "when the right herb is selected [...] its vital life force works synergistically with that of the patient [p.004]."  Maybe this is my favorite: "a plant, which is a living and breathing entity, has the ability to understand and work in synchrony with the body's internal needs, in harmony with the vital force within us, to heal and give life [p.094]."  Generally, 'like curing like,' 'as X' curing 'X,' is known as sympathetic magic (SM).  These quotes are of the vitalistic spiritistic supernaturalistic (VSS) herbalistic strain of sympathetic magic (VSSHerbSM).  As apposed to the homeopathic strain (VSSHomSM).   -rc 
 It sounded like an in-depth treatment of the spiritual dynamics of so-called coincidences. It read like the one-page fodder from an old Reader's Digest. Seriously, this is a few anecdotal tales, and some of them aren't really interesting.  Caveat emptor 
 Having worked in an Embassy, this National Geographic documentary does a marginal job of encapsulating the top level mission of an Embassy as seen through various Ambassadors, but the title is certainly misleading.  Other than a brief glimpse of a hapless junior foreign service officer working in the consular office and an Ambassador's residence, all you see is the 'outside' of the Embassy.  The rest of the State Department functions and other agencies that make up an Embassy are simply ignored in favor of one dimensional political intrigue.  For example, the US Ambassador to Guatemala is shown as an overly strong figure lecturing the President of Guatemala about corruption in his impoverished country, but nothing is said about the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) role in providing hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to assist Guatemala.  Assistance programs are a big part of the Embassy's mission in developing countries, but the good folks at National Geographic chose to ignore this important element.  While the film is useful for those want to get an Ambassador's viewpoint on how they approach the job, don't expect to learn anything about an Embassy and the film is too topical and is already out of date 
 This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.  Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.  I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.   By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%. But make sure you don't buy censored music 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.  The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.  I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.  Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 We tried adding the soap and turned the handlle " really fast" but it still dosent do much?? 
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 Although I do credit this book with whetting my appetite to research further into Lilith and I did enjoy reading it when I first started it, after I did more research myself, I realized how flawed Koltuv's research  is. She makes assertions while giving no evidence (such as stating that  Lilith appears in Germanic mythology, which she doesn't), and she throws a  lot of non-Lilith myths, stories, etc., that are similar to Lilith but  treats them as if they are actually directly connected instead of just  being "archetypally" connected. She also makes the usual claim  that Lilith was originally a goddess, and, per usual, gives no evidence for  this assertion. This is an OK intro to Lilith book and is a fun read, but  do your serious research into Lilith elsewhere 
 Robert Rossen's "The Hustler" is a film about relationships and self-destruction.  It is a tale about learning to triumph in life by recognizing the limitations of your dreams.     Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler who wants to prove that he is the best pool player around.  He seeks out a game with the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and is crushed when the game does not unfold as he envisioned.  Felson moves on and slowly starts to regain his confidence with the help of fellow lost soul Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie).  After hooking up with gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), Felson sets out for Louisville with Packard in tow to compete in a big-money match.  After getting a hard lesson on the cruel realities of life, Felson seeks out a rematch with Minnesota Fats to prove that he has become a changed man.    "The Hustler" looks spectacular in glorious black and white and the pool matches crackle with energy.  However, the character arcs are not as well engaging as they should be.  Felson's transformation feels rushed and is lacking the emotional depth needed to round out his character.  Sarah Packard is similarly underdeveloped.  Her fate should have more of an impact on the viewer but it does not because not enough time has been spent to develop her beforehand.  Scott and Gleason fare better in their roles with the latter being a revelation in a dramatic role.  Also, Newman again proves why he is considered a legend of the silver screen with his strong performance.  Yet, "The Hustler" just does not have enough going for it in the end. 
 The publishers of this CD are being blatantly DISHONEST. The CD claims to be the AUDIO Unlimited Power and even includes a statement about it being narrated by Anthony Robbins.   Yet the CD is NOT AN AUDIO VERSION OF THE BOOK. It is simply a recording of Mr Robbins presenting 50 minutes of material at a seminar.   Only in small letters at the back of the CD does it say "abridged version".   Avoid the CD. Just buy and read the book. 
 Watching this movie and wondering why it was made and for whom.  I cannot escape the thought that perhaps since all the plots have been exhausted and all the movies were made, all that Hollywood has to offer is this. For a while, I watch thinking that perhaps at some point it will add up to something, but in the end there's nothing, just the waste of braincells so graphically depicted in what is perhaps the only 'memorable' scene.  I may be exagerating a bit, I just remembered there are also a couple of vomit scenes. 
 This book is great.  It's great if you want to completely confrom to what's expected for you to do just because someone told you God wants you to do it.  It's great if you believe a higher, supernatural power watches every step you take and actually cares what you do.  It's also great for mimes, you can make some damn funny impersonations too 
 Wasn't it Forrest Gump who said that?  The premise of this film is pretty cute:  dumb people are reproducing at a more rapid rate than smart people, so they overwhelm the smarter folks 500 years from now.  An present-day average person is thawed out and becomes the smartest one.  Well, despite "Talledega Nights," dumb jokes can only take you so far.  After a while, this movie devolves into a standard digest of chase and save, and becomes a unconscious parody of itself.  Some funny lines, some funny moments, but overall, it becomes tiresome 
 This book is no different than any other book on the subject of menopause except that it informs you that if you have sudden menopause the symptoms appear at once instead of gradually. You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out! In sudden meopause you experience the symptoms immediately instead of over a period of years and the solutions to dealing with the symptoms are the same whether menopause is sudden or gradual. Do not waste your money if you have read any other book on the subject of menopause because you will not learn anything new 
 David Thomson thinks he's some kind of superior being and criticizes in a pompous and condescendent manner everything Welles ever did. He's one of those people who think that Welles never achieved anything after Kane. He wonders if he was even really responsible for Kane? He states that Welles did not write any of the script (false), that Greg Toland was director of photography while Robert Wise was responsible for the editing. SO what did Welles do? He directed! Apparently, that's not enough to make Kane his movie, his masterpiece, among others. Well if movies were only based on photography, scripting and editing, then why would directors be needed?  Thomson insults Welles in every paragraph; he hammers him over and over, relentlessly. He focuses on the less successful aspects of his life and exaggerates them. He ridicules him, makes fun of his weight, says he's egotistical, a liar, a misogynist, an unfaithful friend, a machiavellic mischievous man who uses people, cheats on his wives, dates married women, eats like a pig and stuffs his face with anything he could find (he talks a lot about that), a pretend genius or would be genius who thinks he's the victim of evil Hollywood moguls. What other bad things could be said about Welles? Basically, any insult or evil thought you would ever have towards your worse enemy would not match up to the way Thomson writes about Welles.  Welles is not the only target of the author's wrath towards famous people. Any dead actor that was a friend or acquaintance of welles is also treated unkindly, as for the ones who are still alive, Thomson refrains himself from making a judgement. What a coward! Dead celebrities are such easy targets to criticism aren't they?  When Thompson runs out of evil things to say, he talks about his childhood and when he went to see The Third Man with his grand mother who for some reason has a claw instead of a hand. Oh poor little David, he could not hold his grandma's hand, only a claw! Tear. Who cares! Also, he has the annoying habit of interrupting every other chapter with imaginary conversations between the writer (?) and the publisher (?). It's never quite clear and really pointless. It's a way for him to put himself in value and shows how he can also criticize his own work. What a decent man!...  I was not expecting a hagiography, I know Welles was not godlike. Thomson explains at the end of the book that he does not mean to put Welles down, but only attempts to humanize him. Well there's a difference between humanizing someone and destroying the truth. Also, a biography should include anecdotes, facts, it should be detailed and accurate. Thompson writes some kind of very superficial, selective, inaccurate story, with imaginary dialogues about what people could have said to welles or thought of him. You can't assume things in a biography.  The author is too involved with his own thoughts instead of sticking to the facts in an objective manner. If you want to learn about Welles, read "Road to Xanadu' by Simon Callow, which focuses on Welles life up to Kane. Or "This is Orson Welles" which is a series of Welles interviews conducted by Peter Bogdanovich in which Welles tells the story of his life. Sure he had a tendency of lying about his past, but only because he was a story teller. Story Tellers always add a little to the truth. Thomson has no such skill.  Unfortunately I can't give 0 star to this book, or I would. It's really just food for the shredder 
 The story of a recently orphaned girl - Jenny Benet - who instead of becoming a frontier doctor travels back to UK to be reared by her uncle Neville. Upon arrival she finds that he is about to start out on an archeological expedition to find a hidden pyramid. When uncle neville sets out, Jenny, and her guns, are brought along. The expedition is hampered by threats from a fellow archeologist party and a religious sect bent on protecting the pyramid, and helped by cryptic warnings from an anonymous source. The book start out with a bit of backstory to the search, and end with a suddenly appearing egyptian pantheon. My problems with the story are many. Most prominent is the simplicity and childlike way the story is told - 50 pages in I actually had to make sure it wasn't just a bad childrens book I had picked up - and the sudden tacking on of a 'fantastic' ending  that is not in any way made believable or plausible 
 The pockets are too small for men's size 10.5 athletic shoes and women's size 9.5 athletic shoes but sandals and moccasins will fit.  
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading 
 o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod.   Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download.  It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't!  i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.  1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide?  and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?    2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer? 3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry? this is just the beginning 
 The "Proud Tower" is one of Barbara Tuchman's many popular historical works. The Ballantine (mass paperback) edition is a reprint of the 1966 original, probably made because Tuchman's pleasant and accessible writing style has guaranteed excellent sales on all her books. In this particular work, she sets out to describe how the late Victorian period (indicated here as roughly 1890-1914) was not a time of peace and progress, as is often the way it is portrayed in the most simple and shallow of historical descriptions such as those in high schools, but in reality a period of upheaval and tension, making World War I rather a climax than a sudden break.  But it is here also that the content does not merit the style. Tuchman clearly has a good knowledge of her subject and a popular historian's love for storytelling, but what mars her project is her obvious bias and unfairness towards some of the subjects she writes about. For example, her first chapter, on the British upper class, pays absolutely no attention to any of the striking class differences of the time, to the role of Labour leaders, to the economic basis on which the British rentier system was based, etc.  On the contrary, all we are given is some sixty pages meant to convey the utterly clich?d conservative message: that the British aristocracy was perhaps a little far detached from current events, but nevertheless their leisure allowed them to rule the country well thanks to the virtues of upper class education and their lack of "greed".  The same approach is taken towards the other end of the spectrum, in this case incidentally in the next chapter, where Tuchman discusses the anarchist movements. At no point is she willing to even entertain the idea that the anarchists might have had legitimate ideas and that perhaps the lack of enfranchisement and opportunities was a cause for their, admittedly, radical and violent approach. Oh no. Instead the reader is bombarded with phrases such as "the Idea", "the bomb was to be the Messiah", "throbbing with the consciousness of Martyrdom", etc. etc. At each and every turn Tuchman takes her time to discredit every lower class attempt at lashing back, to speak her contempt for the ideals of young, suffering people ("a rebellious soul", "a highly excitable nature"), and to underline how much she hates the idea of revolution even if it is from the horrors of industrial age capitalism and hardly or not at all democratic states ("his goal, like his hate, was generalized toward destruction", "[he] wrote wrathfully for the revolutionary press", "behind the poor foolish megalomania (...) glowed the Idea") and so on. Her own 'insight' into anarchism seems to be best represented by this callous quote: "One of them [the poor] with a sense of injury or a sense of mission, would rise up, go out and kill-and sacrifice his own life on the altar of the Idea". I am myself no anarchist, but her treatment of desperate people, so crushed by their society that they see no other way out than the violent overthrow of even the whole idea of governance, is nothing but cruel and stupefying.  Looking at the following chapters in the book proves this to be no accident. Her description of the transformation of the United States from an isolationist country to a more imperialist approach is positively gushing (expansionists being invariably described as "an adroit master of political strategy and tactics" and "shrewd, worldly, forceful" etc.), she blames the assassination of McKinley for ending attempts to block the negative sides of this imperialism (never anywhere mentioning McKinley's corruption and support for union busting etc.), and when by Chapter Five Tuchman was trying to explain how futile the attempts of the various Peace Conferences were and she describes one of the main expansionist thinkers, Admiral Mahan, as "trying to instruct the public to take an honest look at war", I had enough. Only the chapter about Dreyfus seemed untainted by her dubious look at history, although this is of course easy since the good and the bad side are quite clear to distinguish from hindsight in that particular affair.  This book may be fun for light reading and informative if you know little about the period, but I would not ever rely on it for an honest view of the people or events described in it. For that, it is simply too tainted by her constant awe for all aristocrats and her equally strong contempt for all attempts at political change. Progressive minded people, beware 
 I could be wrong but when i looked a this item i thought it was going to be a router that would interface to my DSL line. all it is a cheap firewall with a switch not at all what i wanted. the discription should say 4 port 10/100 Router. 
  	Picture this, you're a regular kid, trying to make friends and fit in, and the way you do it is by committing a robbery. That isn't the smartest thing to do, now is it? You decide that it won't be a big deal if you just "look out" while your new friends do the real robbery part. Then, your plan backfires completely on you and you end up in jail. This is what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myer's novel titled Monster. This book is a realistic fiction novel and not a very difficult read. Walter Dean Myers does an amazing job of showing what Steve is like. He makes Steve an easy character to relate to by making him like any other kid. That's just until Steve gets put into jail!  This book is written as an autobiography that the main character writes...while doing time in jail. Why did Steve end up in jail? Simply because he was the look out of a robbery? Nope, you have to read the book to figure out with specifics! I would recommend this book to almost any type of readers of all ages. Especially for people like me that enjoy reading Walter Dean Myer's work. It is written fantastically and I think could be one of Walter Dean Myer's best! 
 The advertisement for a $30 credit is deceiving, don't fall for it 
 I produced and directed the America Premier of a stage adaptation of this screenplay off-Broadway in NYC in the mid-70's. Having done much research into the subject including reading the transcript of the trial of Burke and Hare and the writings of Robert Knox I found that this film -- though cast with fine actors and with all the possible resources available to film making and not to a stage production -- fails to offer the audience any real incite into the horror of the story. Rather it makes a feeble, hollywoodish attempt to bring Dylan Thomas' screenplay to life 
 While her struggle is apparent her story is difficult to follow and when it is followed it is merely repition:  "I was held hostage in my own kingdom, I was strong, My subjects came to me with gifts... blah blah blah."  I do not reccomend this book except if you are an insomniac, it certainly can put one to slee 
 Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool.  If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book. 
 Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound 
 ... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the "next Riverdance". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess 
 She is a LIAR!  John 3:13 "No man hath ascended unto heaven except He who came down from heaven"  Acts 2:34 "David has not ascended unto heaven" Hebrews 11:39 "none of the patriarchs have received the promise"  This book is just more fantasy propaganda from the church of Mystery Babylon, Mother of Harlots.  This is damnable heresy from a false prophet (2 Peter 2:1)   
 Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.  In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)    The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.   Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.   
 Doris Day's film career took a nose dive in the late 60s, and lord knows it wasn't her fault. CAPRICE may win the title for her very worst film of all time (perhaps a tie with THE BALLAD OF JOSIE?). Why she ever agreed to participate in such a poor piece of garbage is beyond me.  If you're a Doris Day fan, stay away from anything she made after THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT. That was the last hit she had, and it's easy to see why those that followed were the kind of clap trap she was forced to do.  What a shame 
 Barbara Branden is a former protege of Ayn Rand.  She is also (as the book amply demonstrates) a pretentious mediocrity who appears to be able to offer the world nothing substantive, save a vitriolic, snotty "tell-all" style blast against her former mentor and supposed "friend".        Barbara should have known that a book like this would be exactly the sort of thing Anti-Rand/Anti-Objectivism/Anti-Libertarian types would love -- a "juicy tell-all" purporting to demonstrate that one of the greatest public champions of socio-economic freedom was really just a shrewish, slutty nutcase.       Branden takes exquisite, almost tragically obvious care to paint herself as the wholly-innocent victim of the machinations of Nathaniel Branden (her husband at the time), and the supposedly megalomaniacal villian, Rand.  Her "sympathetic" portrayal of Rand's husband Frank O'Connor manages to show, instead, a pathetic, drunken schmuck, completely browbeaten and psychologically over-powered by his domineering shrew of a wife.      As with NB's retelling of events in "Judgment day", the Brandens portay themselves as the archtypal "innocent, impressionable teenagers destroyed by the vile, capitalistic evil-ness of Ayn Rand".  The truth is doubtless somewhat less flattering in their regard.       It's very ironic this book is taken at all seriously -- given that at least half of it is almost word-for-word reprint of a biographical sketch of Rand that Ms. Branden had published in the hard-to-find book "Who is Ayn Rand?" in 1968, shortly before the break.    No details of Rand's philosophy are given -- not even in summary form -- with the exception of several long-winded and preachy passages misquoting Rand's ideas, and then denouncing them as "dangerous".       To top it all off, after spending 200-plus pages painting Rand as a deceitful, power-mad poseur, Branden  devotes the end of the book to detailing the tremendous impact Rand's advocacy of socio-political freedom and "rational self-interest" have had on the culture at large.       All in all, this book is an obnoxious attempt by a former "friend" to urinate on a dead woman's grave.     I gave it 1 star, but it deserves far less. 
 We enjoy Maxwell's look at leadership. This book hits on the subject of what if you are not the Boss can you still influence people. We thought it was so good we gave it as a gift to a friend to encourage him 
 I echo all the other reviews. Sure, it's a bootleg "filmed" by the band and roadies but that doesn't mean it has to be so bad. The Dimebag tribute should have been left off this disc and a proper tribute put on a professionally produced dvd. The sound on this particular track is horrendous and made my speakers sound like they were blown. Listening to that muddled mess would definitely end up blowing my speakers. Don't waste your money 
 Well, well... hard core treasure buffs are the hardest lot to dissuade.  These 4 and 5 star reviews are something else.  I have never been a big believer in `lost mines/hoards' - gold of this magnitude won't stay hidden for long.  And when it is recovered, the person or persons recovering the hoard won't advertise it.   (...)  While obvious that Brewer has a talent for deciphering obscure and confusing map codes, it is apparent that he has preconceived notions that lead him in the direction he wants to go.  He is like a chemist or scientist that already 'knows' the results he wants to achieve, so he manipulates the experiment to get his desired result.   The Lost Dutchman mine legend is built upon historical fact. It is strains credibility for Brewer to come to Arizona and in a few days re-write the Spanish mining history of the southwest; suddenly it all becomes `Rebel Gold'.    Some of the mines attributed to the `Dutchman' have actually been located and documented - not the cache that Jocob Walzer  hid and occasionally visited - but the actual mine workings of the area around Weaver's Needle. There is nothing particularly unusual about Spanish mine workings in the southwest, and how they were occasionally `high graded' by miners - that sustained them in style for a number of years, while the legend grew and grew.  The Lost Dutchman mine has been romanticized to the point, that it has entered the public domain of movies, books and legend.  What is galling is that Brewer and his partners never even entered the actual Superstition Mountains. Never more than a few minutes from the highway and the air conditioned SUV, they spend their time trespassing and digging on private land, drawing horse heads on topographic maps (get a fresh copy of the Wickenburg area topo maps - you won't find a horse head, a soldier monk anywhere, unless you WANT to see it - then get a black pen and draw it in - you can probably draw in a happy face if you want).  Bob sees `heart shaped' images everywhere - he can hardly walk outside with spotting heart shaped boulders, mountains, rocks - he sees them on the landscape, he sees him in Ashcroft's gag photo, he inks them onto his topo maps.  KGC sign all around - even on US topographic maps - which is so silly it needs no further comment.   They find shotgun shells arranged in a five pointed star and conclude that is KGC sign - are we to conclude that these shells have lain on this spot for decades or that the KGC is just hours ahead?   He finds something that he decides is significant, announces it as a `clue'.  Later he finds another random item he decides is a clue and points out that `it lines up precisely with the previous clue'.   Well sure, Bob - two points make a straight line.  Thanks for the basic geometry lesson.    What begins to push this entire book into the `conspiracy' section of the local library is the helicopter scenario right out of the X-Files.  What is probably a realtor showing property (first helicopter flyby) or a federal officer (second one) is spun into such contrived weirdness that it demonstrates that Brewer and the boys are way out of their league in the Southwest.   Southern Arizona isn't the wooded hills of Arkansas and Oklahoma - this is the hard Sonoran Desert - drugs, bounty hunters, smugglers, illegal aliens, etc.  It is gradually becoming militarized and being confronted by feds exhibiting odd behavior is not unusual.  These well fed treasure tourists with the metal detectors (mountain men as Getler continually reminds us) must have been quite a sight shaking at the site of the mysterious helicopter flying `sentinel'.  Later they are unnerved by the sight of a `dead' rabbit, they conclude that it had been left as a `warning' and that they didn't want to wind up like `Adolf Ruth'.  (Adolf Ruth was murdered, shot in the head by one of the itinerant cowboys that guided him into the Superstitions; animals most likely separated the head from the body during the months it was exposed.)   The idea that the KGC would have helicopter flying 'sentinels' that would go to the trouble to confront a couple of fat guys wandering around looking at rocks is ludicrous.  But since they have this image of this vast treasure hoard buried somewhere round here, they have created aura of paranoia around them - everything has import. They ask us to believe that the Knights of the Golden Circle (disbanded 90 years ago) have a helicopter STANDING BY, to frighten off people with metal detectors.   Beech tree graffiti, helicopters (at least they weren't black), `eyes rolled back' gag photo, grandpa riding a horse ("on patrol" guarding the treasure - well, sure... of course - that's obvious), photo of Albert Pike (total nutcase), `coded' photograph of some winking dandy so full of self importance he loads up the photo with the most obvious of `codes' - his mysterious `all seeing eye' on the instep of his shoe.  One thing that Brewer and Getler seem to not understand is that Freemasonry is NOT a secret society; it is - if anything - a society of secrets - and most of those are public knowledge.      In Arizona, using a backhoe and without the owner's permission, they dig up a trash midden.  Each bit of random trash has deep significance, more `code' - you wonder if, for Brewer, a cigar is EVER just a cigar.  Every single item has some hidden meaning - and when the bottom of the debris fails to deliver the expectant treasure - rather than admitting they were digging for nothing, the mystery deepens.  This trash heap is suddenly placed there to `throw them off the trail'.  Brewer states that it all confirms his research.  The author actually includes a photo of these guys with all the junk they recovered laid out.   Junk - all of it - a book on what they claim is the largest treasure hoard in North America and these guys are digging up pig iron and broken kitchenware. Two pieces of rusted steam pipe are the `cross' of the skull and crossbones, some scrap metal is shaped like a heart, a horse skull is an `ancient French Breed used by Crusader Knights', broken pottery has a circle design underneath.   To them, all of this has coded significance. This reminds me of that 'Calvin and Hobbs' comic skit - where Calvin is 'excavating for dinosoars' and digs up all this junk - soda cans, bottles, pipes - what does this all mean?  Calvin assembles his 'artifacts' into a dinosoar and announces his 'discovery'.   With a bit of training these `mountain men' could be shown how to tell the difference between `artificially disturbed soils' (deliberately buried) and random deposition by wind or water.  These are standard archeological recognition skills and knowledge of geological deposition.  Brewer shows no real knowledge of what is known as `site formation processes'.  If `hunting for buried treasure' in the ground has been as important part of his life as this book claim it has, then he would understand these things.  It confirms my idea that Brewer is the armchair sort - and comfortable with his ciphers and codes - most of which he made up.    The entire Arizona portion was just hilarious - like tourists on a Caribbean Island Club Med vacation walking around looking for signs of pirate treasure. Suddenly they are comfronted by a landowner who runs them off, and they decide that the man is a descendant of Captain Kidd guarding the buried treasure chest.   And then the final cop-out in the book - Brewer has this `immense calm' come over him and decided - or one isn't quite sure - to leave the treasure where it is - conveniently located on federal lands (Brewer and Getler - in true paranoid fashion decide that is part of the `conspiracy' as well).  Ah!   I can't recover the treasure, but could if I wanted to, but I don't' want to, since it was guarded by my family members and I have conflicting emotions, and it IS on government land so we can't dig it up.  This of course, provides an excuse for the fact that Brewer never found much more than a jar full of coins after 40 years of searching.  I am sure, however, that he will continue to be a big hit at the Treasure show circuits.    
 I gave this two stars only because I got to see some characters I haven't in a long time. The writing is disjointed, poorly characterized and the art was so bad in the original that they had to fix or finish it here.  There do seem to be some revelations that the changes in this edition (versus the actual series) hint at, but at this point, who cares?  The story itself makes little sense. Characters are brought back into continuity just to be killed off. Major events come out of nowhere, and seem to have been made up out of desperation.  For example, Superboy Prime tries to re-start the universe by flying through Oa at light speed, which makes no sense at all, and there seem to be pages devoted to the most tenuous connections to other series. The whole thing is incredibly contrived and forced, just to fit a plot that seems to have changed during the story.  The worst part is that this isn't even a whole story, given that 52 is still going on, and you need to have read more than 4 other stories to get all of what is going on.  No thanks. 
 The ebook version contains maps, figures and pictures which are unreadable 
 First, I think I should tell you that this book and another of Steve Russo's " What's the Deal with Wicca" is The SAME BOOK but with passages rearranged.   Secondly as a Wiccan for over two decades, presumably I would know all about my religion. Russo does not diffentiate between the various Pagan groups, Wicca and " witchcraft". I think he makes no distinction deliberately.  On the surface the book(s) looks semi- well researched, but a more informed reader can see that is a mask for the same old " all other religions are decepttions of satan" stuff that books attacking Wicca and the occult in the 1980s spewed out from Christian publishing houses.  The sanctimonious arguments that Wicca has no real values, we worship the creation not the creator, ad nauseum shows a pretense of knowledge but more of the author's own biases than anything objective.  Russo's biases and Bible-'rationalized" intolerance shows through no matter how much he tries to sweeten it. And, like in many " arguments" for comversion, Russo cheats. If you are a parent cocnerned about your teen involed in Wicca, this book is NOT the one you should read. " When Someone You Love is Wiccan" by Carl McColman is far more informantive, unbiased, and the author is not trying to decieve you to uphold his own biases 
 I love dissecting punching physics. A book that would lead me to my own exploration of that would be a wonderful thing. Or; any teacher that would want me to make my own exploration of martial arts and stay away from politics would probably be what I need. Need I say more ? 
 Is it not important to make history interesting to read?  This book is so boring, misdirected and verbose I couldn't finish it.  Rather than talk about the issues of the title, Francis spends more time going on and on about what Sewall had for dinner, what he paid for land, his romp through London and wars against Indians.  I appreciate the accuracy and thoroughness of his research.  But his inability to focus and put words together that are fun to read make this book painful 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son, Will, and his father, Sonny; between Sonny and his wife Aila; between Sonny and his lover Hannah, between everyone and the political situation at hand. However, the frequency of pronouns can be confusing and the long,  impassioned dialogues never directly state anything at all. One must  already be familiar with the apartheid and liberation movement to fully  comprehend the book 
 Don't buy this book. Save your effort and money.This book won't help you to become a better writer. I bought the book because I was influenced by 5-stars reviews on this board, and, for my pity, I completely ignored opinions of those who was disappointed with this book ( Sorry!)Those who rate the book  5-stars, it seems to me that  them just didn't read really great books on writing: John Gardner " Becoming a Novelist" and " Art of Fiction"; "The elements of style" of Shrunk & White; Thomas S. Kane "Essential guide to writing".          
 A number of talented actors walk through this sham, half awake.  Motor cars, and tiny minds, poorly scripted, rubbish for the brain dead.  Get a life. 
 This book, short and terse, takes a reproachful tone and minimalist explanation style. My biggest crticism, though, is its lack of challenging words. Those who have no trouble telling apart "incite" from "insight," "disparage" from "disparate," and "plum" from "plumb" aught to look elsewhere to satisfy their intellectual curiousities. I was wholly disappointed with this book, but very glad to have found a replacement for it called "The Bibliophile's Dictionary," which is in every way superior.  This book is a reference for the laity and, in my unintentionally high-brow opinion, should be skipped 
 "This songbook uses a unique system ... The system may seem tricky at first, but  a lot of people find it works really well once they get the hang of it." I found it to be quite "tricky" and didn't have the patience/skill to "get the hang of it." I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but an accomplished musician 
 This book does not live up to its title and subtitle.  Very general material.   For example, Denial of Service Attacks are in the news these days.  Looking through the index, I find four references to DOS attacks.  The first on page 45 tells me that DOS attacks can be costly.  The second  on page 85 describes some previous DOS attacks, including one that took  place 12 years ago.  The next reference is on page 304 and is a historical  description of DOS attacks over the past three years.  The last reference  on page 452 tells me that I should conduct DOS testing for my web server.   Most of the book's content is similar.  If this is useful to you, please  buy this book.  For specific help in hardening your network, please look  elsewhere 
 While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B 
 This book is written for biologist who mistakenly believe that  bioinformatics problems can be can be solved without mathematics, statistics and computer science. The author knowingly avoids these important components of the bioinformatics equation in his presentation and as a result several problems arise. The most noticeable is that the book is almost incomprehensible. David Mount and his editors must realize that verbal descriptions in place of mathematical formalism will not lead to an understanding necessary to solve bioinformatics problems and advance the field. David Mount and authors of similar books will be responsible for raising an entire generation students who can merely repackage preexising software packages and provide ad hoc(theoretically weak)solutions to bioinformatics problems 
 The first book was not great, but at least good. This is so dreadful that I couldn't even make it through it. Nonsensical plot, Non-existent plot, Nothing plot. Those terms all describe this one. This isn't worth reading; whether you've read the first one or not. Doyle can be so much better than this!! 
 1. May reflect the author or editor's own lack of interest in pro sports.  Mentions that Vegas has pro baseball and hockey teams but inexplicably fails to provide any info about them (name of team, phone number, website and e-mail addresses, dates of season, ticket prices, name and location of arena or stadium, major-league affiliations).  If many folks don't care about Vegas's spectator sports options, that's fine.  But my family makes a point of visiting the local pro baseball & hockey teams wherever we travel in the US & Canada, and the author didn't put forth even minimal effort to inform us of our options. 2. The "Side Trips" chapter covers many interesting attractions, such as the Hoover Dam, Area 51, Red Rock Canyon & Lake Mead.  But it makes no mention of Nevada's famous brothels (or infamous, depending on your point of view) -- some of which are in counties adjacent to Vegas/Clark County.  If some readers find the brothels offensive or unappealing, that's fine.  But the author should provide the information and let the reader decide whether to skip it or read it. 3. The guide has a "section" on Internet access, but doesn't bother to list even one Internet cafe (or coffeehouse with free Net access).  How hard is that? 4. The accommodations section is fairly thorough, but misses a rather obvious property:  the Marriott Grand Chateau Resort.  It's large and right on the Strip - hard to miss.  It was under construction long before the guide's publication date and occupancy starts in October '05 
 this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. c 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 Many of Ms Garwood's books have similiar plots and characters, yet each usually stands on its own.  I don't know WHAT happened here, but this book was boring.  There's no other way to say it 
 This amazingly thin book is low on content and quality.  I'm sure there are blogs out there that make much better reading.  Very empty, very bland.  I'm amazed that you can actually have a career as a flight attendant and have so FEW experiences to relate!  Oh, I hid in the luggage bin!  Oh, I forgot my uniform and had to wear one 10 sizes too small!  Oh, I spilled orange juice on a passenger!  Come on!  I bought it due to the 20 positive customer reviews.  Could it be a case of the author reviewing her own book, under different names?   I believe it must be.... Or her friends and family...  Amazon customer reviews are usually pretty reliable, but once in a while you come across a case like this where the reviews are totally skewed and disconnected from reality.  Save your money!!!!  Don't buy it!! 
 I started buying Hotel Costes backwards starting from 6,5,4,then 2. Then I bought 3 and 1 and those two just wasn't as good as the others. Some what disappointed. At least know I know his newer ones are getting better and not worst, right 
 Now that Hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation.   "Thank God for Hannity!" -Lee Krock, founder of NAMBL 
 This is essentially another attempt at seperating profound German thinkers who were somehow idealistically affiliated indirectly with Nazism, from Hitler. Whether it be Nietzsche, Wagner or Strauss there is simply an ocean of oxymoronic literature devoted to *pretending* every free thinker and artist in history adopted the same judeo-christian "equality" ideals as a generic "free tookie" college marxist, in reality national socialism is a direct reality of Nietzsches bright fantasy, merciful lost Europe rallying in for once the defense of its own beauty rather than dwelling in self hatred and the worship of failing ethnicities, abolishing slavery thus being blamed for it, abolishing gender inequality thus being blamed for it. Nietzsche was a worshipper of beauty itself rather than the self loathing linear 'philosophy' of other westerners.  Nietzsche is often said to "oppose anti-semitism" to justify his hypothetical opposition to Nazism, yet in his own words describes Jews as foul smelling creatures (this is not to mention National Socialism has pro and anti jewish sects. The obvious proto-Nazi mental state of himself and his sister creates an obstacle for typical minded modern readers who are shocked initially by Nietzschean philosophy, thus an entire industry has been built around "disproving the racist lies" etc. For another example see the industry built around disproving the Bell Curve, another case of actually intelligent racism being flooded by leftist extremists, like Kathleen Higgins and Robert Solomon.  Anyone who truly understands Nietzche and comprehends genetic elitism, natural selection on a spiritually endorsed level, is better off buying pure translations of his work and cutting the introductions and editor notes out with a pair of scissors-thats what yours truly does.  This is, in all ways, another off shoot of the watered down politically correct anti-racist "nihilist" teenage movement, only for adults who appreciate nietzsche yet belong to a group he found unworthy 
 For years people have been calling this album a "masterpiece" but what's so great about it?  This is the sound of a man and his woman holed up in their apartment for far too long.  Really, is this the best Lennon could come up with after five years?  It's a shame he had to go out on this note.  These simple songs about domesticity may have had a certain charm at the time but time has not been kind to this CD.  The lyrics are mostly love letters to each other or their son Sean (who was five at the time) or both.  But there's nothing wrong with silly love songs, RIGHT JOHN??  Correction:  there's nothing wrong with WELL WRITTEN silly love songs, and that's one thing that Double Fantasy lacks.  "Woman" sounds incredibly monotonous now, even more so than back in 1980.  The one saving grace is "Watching the Wheels", an interesting observation of Lennons perspective on the music business.  The music, which was played by popular session musicians back in the day, is unremarkable and lacks distinction.  And I haven't even mentioned Yoko yet!  Walking on Thin Ice has a repetitive, robotic groove that appeals to some, but why must this woman open her mouth and utter such banal shrieks and shrills?  Kiss Kiss Kiss is the definitive low point for this record.  Yoko's orgasmic screaming on this track makes one visualize the ugly prospect of John & Yoko having sex.  That was too much for most people who didn't even want to visualize the two of them even being together 
 Do NOT purchase this "Flexi-Skin. What a waste of 20 bucks!!  The skin hinders the camera's functionality.  A very small portion of the "Flexi-Skin" blocks the camera lens, thereby messing up the photos. I had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures.  Next, it makes your otherwise super-pimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk, more akin to a Zach-Morris style Nokia from 1993..................Additionally,  The Flexi-Skin actually TRAPS dust and other particles between the skin and the phone.    This item blows in both functionality and aesthetics, don't waste you money! ! !   
 To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character 
 Booooo. Not fun, don't waste your money on this one. Talk about disappointment. I have searched for cool tub toys for so long and thought for sure I had a winner. Nope! 1)The little clown head doesn't stay on. 2)the beach ball that you squeeze to make the water run down the slide, simply doesn't provide enough umph to get the water really going 3) the slide keeps falling off 4) the suction cups don't hold really well. I took the slide off and now we just pour water into the cup at the top and call it a day 
 No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education 
 I thought the book was rather bland and perverse. Not much interaction between the 2 main characters and I found the suspense plot lacking as well.  Bottom line: Do not recommend. 
 Animal Man Volume 1, reprints Animal Man # 1-9. I was expecting a lot from Animal Man. I am a long-time Vertigo reader and enjoy most of Grant Morrison's work. This being his first entry into American mainstream comics (and the start of the famed "British Invasion"), I was expecting something along the lines of Shade the Changing Man or Doom Patrol. Instead we get pretty standard superhero fare complete with the requisite appearances by Superman, Hawkman, et al. Majority of this book is centered around Animal Man's return to super-heroics, his battles with B'wana Beast and Mirror-Master. There is also a cross-over with DC's "Invasion" storyline from the late 80's, which is a bit distracting. Granted, Animal Man Books 2-3 do get progressively better and start to contain some of the experimentation that you might expect from Morrison. So the story in itself isn't too bad, and I would have been content with just picking out some early signs of genius (such as issue # 5). But what really took away from my enjoyment of this book is Chas Truog's terrible art. You would think that with a title like "Animal Man", they would find an artist that could draw a decent cat or dog. Although people are drawn pretty badly too. Backgrounds are rushed or non-existent and it feels as if no effort was put into the art for this book at all. As bad as the art is, the coloring is even worse! It looks like maybe 12 colors were used total for the entire book. Only recommended for Morrison completists and late-80s-era DC superhero fans that are able to overlook shoddy art. Story 2/5 stars. Art 1/5 stars 
 I was assigned to read this book over the summer by my school, and I had to unpleasantly plow my way through this book. I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters got on my nerves SO much; all they did was whine and complain about things not even related to the accident, and I hated the way they thought. I couldn't read this book for more than 30 minutes at a time; it bored me too much. I feel like this book had no point to it at all. I didn't learn any "lessons," nor did I find myself even relating to the characters at any point during the story. Sorry, this book was just really, really awful 
 The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom 
 Don't you all really want some kind of variety in your life. All the guys in Dipset are making the exact same songs over and over on different albums. There isn't anything original to what any of them are doing. When will you get tired of hearing about what these kats bought or what they are riding in? Most people are so wrapped in what they own that they don't even look at the skills of the rapper. Then most of the time the stuff you are mesmerized by, they don't own it they just rented it for the video. These guys have no talent and are flushing decent beats down the toilet 
 I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand. I don't think we need to know all about History. A little background information would have been enough. It was repetitive. He was abrasive and annoying. I did agree with who marketers are ignoring but these marketers aren't listening. Mainly this just kind of repeats what he has done in the past 
 I've been following David Torn for quite some time, but this is by far the worst album he's ever done. This was a waste of time, money, and effort.  What we have here are no compositions, no melodies, no harmony, and no rhythm. Why would a great guitarist like Torn release such crap? I have no idea.  If you want to hear a great new album by a jazz guitarist check out John Abercrombie's new album "The Third Quartet. 
 it was bad in a way but it got better. It was a cool book with a lot  of things most people would not  think of.Yeah 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
 Not easy for any beginner to use. Unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i.e. English, Scottish, Irish... etc, it was a bit confusing. Marks are black & white, some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print. If you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates, this may be for you. If you want information about your piece, pass it up 
 I have the wrong book. I needed a book on the I Mac version of Elements 4. I received the Windows version of Elements 4. To me the book is useless 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 I couldn't even make it to that "magic" fourth or fifth day when all cravings are supposed to magically disappear. From the very beginning, I was so incredibly jittery, which is 1 of the claims Hoodia reps make. I, also feel sleepy all the time, yet I can't nap and my sleep has been severely disrupted by all the jitteriness- I'm what you call TOO TIRED TO SLEEP! REALLY, how many over-the counter appetite suppressants actually work. I believe none of them work better than a placebo (and maybe that's what some of you are experiencing?). DON'T BOTHER WITH this one. A total waste of a lot of money - this stuff isn't exactly cheap, either; take your $$ and go buy some sneakers, get a little exercise & you'll be a lot better off! 
 Until now, I enjoyed John Maxwell's books, but this one is just one big yawn.  Same stuff you read in his other books, which are much better.  
 I bought this pedometer for myself, and bought my wife a $20 Omron pedometer, and hers' is far superior. Easier to set up, more accurate, durable. Lesson: spend a few dollars more for something that works well. This one is disposable junk 
 I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today. 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I approached this book with some hope that it would yield help in understanding the great truths of "Christ in you, the hope of glory", the "new self"; and many of the other profound distinctives of this letter. I was even open, as a stalwart conservative evangelical, to stretch my orthodoxy to make it more generous, but what I got was an effort to make every word of Colossians fit the neo-liberation theology agenda of its authors. Let the book say what it says, not what you had hoped it would say.  
 It used to be that Rhino took excellent care and pride in all of its releases.  This no longer seems to be the case.  Easily, The Name of This Band is one of a small number of superior rock and roll live albums, and preferable musically to the more famous Stop Making Sense, which works better as a theatrical release than as a listening experience at home on the victrola.  That initial expanded touring band featuring Bernie Worrell of P-Funk fame adding his signature swimming textures and a post-Bowie pre-King Crimson Adrian Belew on scorching guitar was both a revelation for many in the audience uninitiated into either seventies funk or seventies noisy art-rock and an amazing leap into the unknown for Talking Heads.  The expanded version indeed adds some worthy items to the overall set list, such as "The Big Country" on disc one and "Warning Sign" as well as a seemingly Fela-influenced and irresistibly funky "Born Under Punches" on disc two.  However, as other reviewers have noted, there was a slow intro to "Crosseyed and Painless" from the original vinyl release that has been deleted, which not only MADE that particular version of the song, as a contrast to the tempo increase which followed, but was one of the most enjoyable sections of the entire 1980-1981 record.  The beginning of this intro can be heard on the fade at the end of "The Great Curve" where Byrne announces that it's okay to dance if you want to.  Maddeningly, the producers at Rhino chose to remove this section from album, thereby breaking what is essentially rule number one of reissues.  While it's okay to remove crowd noises or orchestrations added after the fact, NEVER, but NEVER, delete ANY MUSIC that was on the original release.  EVER.  FOR ANY REASON.  Those very familiar with an original release will want everything that was on it initially, even the parts they didn't like.  Not only that, but apparently this was done to place "The Great Curve" at the end of disc two, the slow intro excised for the mind-numbingly LAME reason to be able to present the exact set list from the tour.  While understandable from a historical standpoint, I doubt that ANYONE would remember the EXACT RUNNING ORDER of the set list (unless they were some kind of fanatic and actually wrote it down during or immediately after the show) from a concert they saw 23 TO 24 YEARS AGO.  Further, if time was an issue for mastering the second disc, Rhino could have easily dispensed with the version of "Once In A Lifetime" in an arrangement that would be finally and fully fleshed out on the next tour, or better yet "Stay Hungry" since it adds little to the version ALREADY PRESENT ON THE OTHER DISC.  Perhaps lopping off a one minute or so intro to a song doesn't warrant dissatisfaction with the entire job, as there is much that is commendable about this reissue.  However, most songs stayed in the can on an original issue for good reason, and only a few on this expanded version needed to see the light of day; an intelligent band's initial instincts are usually correct.  As far as the producers at Rhino are concerned, cutting out that little intro was simply inexcusable.  The band was right in 1982 when they ended side four with "Take Me to the River;" stupid to both remove a piece of the original document and second-guess them at the same time.  Shame on you, Rhino, you've done so many things right in the past.  I think you should either offer to exchange a corrected version to anyone who wants one free of charge, or give those so inclined their money back.  Don't ever make such an egregious mistake again: you should know better 
 LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage 
 This book does contain useful information about general nutrition, especially when it comes to encouraging whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Beware, though, because the author advocates megadoses of vitamins that in many cases are not considered safe by the medical community. While she does reference studies in some cases, she also bases a lot of claims on anecdotal experience, and any scientist knows this isn't science at all. 
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 1st song got me interested. Half way through, I started skipping out of boredom.  This music's been made before.  Goodbye and go home 
 I haven't received this product but you're asking me for a review?? Suggest you check your shipping records!! I still want it but haven't received it to date 
 I agree with "thecollegebum" that this title is an improvement over the Playoff title from the same year. It is a bit more explicit, but nowhere near the 1999-2004 "golden era", as thecollegebum calls it.  I also agree that Martina Warren would definitely not have been my choice to receive the POY award, although I am sure she will appeal to plenty of guys who like blonde bombeshells. To me, she is just too much of a stereotypical Barbie doll. And when she opens her mouth, oh my, oh my... If you want to see a real girl behind all those blonde jokes, look at Martina. That's her!  My main complaint, however, is that too many things in this film are REPETITIVE (and hence become boring soon). The same kind of lingerie all over. The same hairstyles all over. The same poses all over. The same (tame) action in GG scenes all over. The same style of furnishing all over. The same kind of music all over. Call it lack of creativity. At times, I felt the purpose of this video was not to arouse you, but to put you to sleep.  All in all, I give it two stars for reasons explained above.  Hey, thecollegebum: Do you ever visit Midnightowlvideo? You should definitely check it out, esp. the message boar 
 My initial reaction to this book, when a friend (laughingly) sent it my direction, was unprintable. But -- slightly redacted -- it went like this:  ***** WHO ARE THESE MORONS?  Have the editors at Zondervan lost their minds? Did they have minds to begin with? *****  I cannot find a single redeeming feature to this tragicomical book. The authors are earnest, but they are completely clueless about the philosophical concepts they are trying to summarize and employ. They might, with equal hope of success, have attempted to explicate quantum field theory. (Hmm, let's see, Fock space -- well, have you seen "Meet the Fockers" ...?)  In the space of an Amazon review it is impossible to do more than point out a few typical errors. Here are three classes of mistakes.  First, the authors put their foot in it when they try to deal with terms from logic (p. 31). If they were merely making up some new technical terms, we might deplore their decision to redefine words that already have established meanings and let it go at that. "Deductive method" as they define it has nothing to do with deduction; ditto for the other terms. But no; they intend to pin the third category on the American logician Charles Sanders Peirce. And they seem to think as Stygius comments in another review on this site, that "abduction" here means "kidnaping":  ***** Abductive reasoning (a seismic little phrase coined by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce) has powerful implications for preaching -- and all communication, really. To go abductive, get rid of your inductive/deductive outlines and make your sermons pointless! In other words, don't build your sermons around analysis (the A-word of modernity), but instead, build them around an abductive experience, one that takes people out of their current world of assumptions and issues, of boredom and anxiety. ... Rather than leading your hearers along in an orderly, step-by-step, predictable, reasoned argument, like a lawyer before a jury -- proving and moving on, proving and moving on -- seize them by their lapels, like a friend in crisis. Grab them by the scruff of the neck (their imagination) and throw them into something they never expected. (pp. 31-32) *****  Warning: Do not try this on people with trained minds unless you want your cognitive hand broken. The only good thing I can find to say about this passage is that the authors are doing their level best to practice what they preach. There isn't any sign of reasoned argument here. There isn't even any sign of grammar. (Or did they really mean to indicate, as a puckish part of me wants to believe, that the friend in crisis is the one doing the seizing?)  But there are some incongruous trappings of scholarship. A footnote refers the reader to K. T. Fann's sober little monograph Peirce's Theory of Abduction. I defy anyone to find a trace of this kind of silliness in Fann's book -- or in Peirce. (See his collected papers, section 5.189.) You will, I grant, find much nonsense (though more subtly presented) in Julia Kristeva's work, which they incomprehensibly bundle into the same footnote. I doubt if the authors have even read Kristeva. But unless we begin questioning their honesty we cannot possibly believe that they've read any serious amount of Peirce, the fellow who was so enraged by fuzzy thinking that he fulminated that "nothing can clear it up but a severe course of logic." Amen.   Imagination is a wonderful thing, and properly disciplined it can be a great tool. C. S. Lewis comes to mind here. But it should be used in conjunction with reason, not as a substitute for it.  Second, the authors make ridiculous claims about the current state of scholarship. "It is hard to find scholarship that is not destabilizing assumptions about rationality and challenging intellectual categories inherited from the Enlightenment," they crow on pp. 20-21. A footnote directs us to another po-mo chic tract but not to the supposed void in traditional scholarship. Actually, the problem is that the authors aren't reading anything outside of a pathetic little circle of their po-mo friends. Otherwise they would surely have encountered something by Doug Geivett or Doug Groothuis or William Lane Craig or Bill Vallicella or Peter Kreeft or Dallas Willard or Charles Taliaferro or Paul Copan or Stephen Parrish or Stephen T. Davis or J. P. Moreland or John Warwick Montgomery or John Gerstner or R. C. Sproul or N. T. Wright or ... okay, you get the picture. And I'm just listing people who would probably be comfortable describing themselves as (broadly) Evangelical Christians. In the main currents of secular analytic philosophy, "scholarship" that is "destabilizing assumptions about rationality" is nearly non-existent. Pick up a recent issue of Mind or Journal of Philosophy or British Journal for the Philosophy of Science and see for yourself.  Third, the authors fuddle and fuzzify major theological categories in the manner of old-fashioned theological modernism. "Easter," Sweet tells us on p. 12, "is all about dying into the new," and he goes on to identify "the new" with "postmodern culture" which "thrums with possibility." Odd. I thought Easter was about the resurrection of God incarnate. Can we at least find room to mention that little point?  Readers who think I have simply picked soft targets are welcome to leaf through the sample pages made available here on the Amazon site and see for themselves. I won't even recommend pages. Start anywhere.  Brian McLaren writes in his preface that this book has given the authors "a chance to lodge in key words some of our best thinking so far" regarding postmodern ministry (p. 13). The scary thing is, I almost believe him 
 Shambles of an erotic thriller the sex scenes are virtually non existent and the story line is terrible i was very dissapointed with my purchase and encourage all to avoid this film 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 I found thins book to be not at all helpfull to me in moving to New Zealand. In fact I found it to be very out of date and the back section that talks about the Kiwi people and their way of life seemed depressing to me. I found the book to be constantly stereo typeing Kiwis. Sheep, beer, rugby etc. I think that the information in this book was true 10 years ago but a lot has changed in New Zealand in that time, especially in the cities. The information in this book is all available on the internet and it is constantly updated there 
 Well, sorry to be the only one in disagreement, but this is a trivial and sophomoric book with absolutely nothing original in it. First off, I did live during Mickey's time, and I knew him casually. There are a lot of books describing Mickey's faults, all of which he admitted to himself. The pop psychology, done from a distance, with just the right amount of politically correct sociology really gets old in sports books. The Author contradicts himself several times and does not understand at all the mentality of managers or players in the late 40's and 50's. He  gets off on the strangest tangents, and I can't for the life of me figure out what he was driving at. It's a pointless book that reminds me of an article in a checkout stand tabloid. Skip this, get Golenbock's "Dynasty" or "Wild, High and Tight" 
 By far the least informative book I've read on Fibromyalgia. It's far too simplfied and woefully incomplete. For instance, the most diffinitive diagnostic tool for Fibromyalgia, the 18 pressure points, is barely mentioned. Called "tender points" in this book, the location and description of these points, how this test is correctly administered, and the important of the test are missing. Without them, you do not have Fibromyalgia. Also, I realize this book is "for Dummies", but give me a break, no one is this simple. More substance and a lot less fluff are needed. Even the writing is mediocre at best. Instead, I strongly suggest you read "Inside Fibromyalgia" by Mark J. Pellegrino, MD (who has the condition himself.) This is my number one reference, easy enough to understand, but solid medically with accurate and sensible diagnostic and treatment help. Also, "Living Well with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia" by Mary J. Shomon (a patient herself) is much better researched and better written than "Dummies." This is a serious subject and even a "Dummies" book should be more comprehensive than this! 
 I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it 
 This little book is a bitter pill. Written and illustrated by a new dad, its tone aspires to be searingly honest. It may well be, since I never liked the water-color-painting, former Yale jock, who muses openly about the conflicts in new fatherhood. For me, it rang false from the opening, when he described the birth as a head coming out of his "best friend." To resort to such a roundabout way of naming his wife is typical of Cooper's puer eternis tone; he knocks about with his daughter, visiting the Cheese Board, Chez Panisse, Royal Cafe in Rockridge. I liked Berkeley in his book, but I couldn't stand him. There definitely are fine turns of phrasing speckling the otherwise self-enamored prose, which aims to give the author's character flaws a pass (arrogance, irritability, selfishness) by disclosing them 
 Appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget, CGI enhanced anime theatrical releases have: Gorgeous visuals, but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog. Trust me, I was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you. I wanted this to be a great movie (as I am a fan of the OAV animated series). Appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone... but that is about all 
 I was sucked into this book as one of the "campanion" books to a book that I was purchasing through Amazon.  I was hoping for an insightful book on our culture, instead it was just a bunch of whining people who use tiny examples of people behaving badly in public and try to roll it into an argument that our society is basically bad. Honestly, they use examples like people acting rudely on a bus!    The only type of person who would enjoy this book is a crotchety old fart who is looking for evidence that his bitchy, whining, and negative view of the world is correct.  Everyone else should avoid this book!  Oh, the introduction is written in an extreme acedemic style. It's been awhile since I studied up for the GRE, so I had to pull my thesaurus out a number of times to try to follow the editor's introduction.  I gave up after awhile because it was obvious that he had a bigger thesaurus than mine. (I couldn't find some of the words!)  Okay, I'm impressed, your vacabulary is bigger than mine, but you lost your audience, so what's the point?!!  Save your money, and avoid this book.  Patrick Robinso 
 To list all the statements in Roscoe Blunt's book "Foot Soldier" that are factually incorrect would take more space  than a review should use.  I will cover only one action, the Roer River crossing.  I made this crossing with the first assault in a boat at 0330 23 February 1944.  I was a member of the 1st Battalion Headquarters Company Antitank Platoon 334th Regiment 84th Division.  For the Roer crossing I was part of a bazooka team attached to Rifle Company C.  This operation is accurately portrayed in the 334th Regimental History "Fortune Favored the Brave", Mannheimer Grossdruckerei, August 1945.  My name PFC Douglas J Harvey on page 136 establishes that I was in this attack.  The Divisional History "The 84th Infantry Division in The Battle Of Germany" states Blunt's Regiment, the 333, crossed the Roer River on the 24th on the well-established bridgehead.  His account indicates tanks were crossing at the same time.  The first tanks crossed noon of the 24th establishing that he was not in the first wave.  Only two air attacks by individual aircraft, ME 262s, one of which was shot down, are mentioned in the 84th divisional history.  However, artillery hits were frequent.  Blunt's stories of throwing grenades, being strafed by waves of planes, and hand to hand fighting after crossing on the foot bridge are pure fantasy.  This all supposedly took place 36 hours after the initial attack of which I was a part.  I had difficulty in reading all of Blunts book because of my frequent anger by his distortion of facts.  No star was not an option or I would have used it.  Douglas J Harvey   PFC 1st Battalion Headquarters Company Antitank Platoon 334th Regiment 84th Infantry Division 
 Racist Black Garbage 
 Anyone who is looking for an economic analysis on why the IMF and World Bank (something that should be done rigorously) should be abolished should look elsewhere.  This book is not a condemnation of the IMF and the World Bank, but a condemnation of free trade and capitalism.  He talks about how markets create inequality.  My response to that is: so what?  People by their very nature are unequal, with skills that are in various states of demand.  It is not surprising that an electrical engineer is more valuable, thus gets paid more than and cashier and that a CEO gets paid more than an electrical engineer.  The more scarce and in demand (i.e., valuable) your skills are the more you will get paid.  Another example is the following: Suppose John makes $20/hr and Jason makes $15/hr, then at the end of the year John gets a 10% raise and Jason get a 5% raise.  The inequality between the two have increased, BUT they are both better off because they each make more.  Even more importantly, though, is that countries that evolved using markets (the West) have far less economic inequality than countries using so called "planned" economies, i.e., markets do NOT increase inequality, but centrally planned economies do.  He then talks about how businesses will deplete any and all resources in the name of the bottom line, using the logging industry as an example.  No industry is so foolish and short sighted.  The logging industry knows that if it cuts down every last tree, then it will no longer be in business, so they take steps to avoid this.  They modify trees to grow faster, plant a tree for every one they cut down, and rotate through different patches, coming back to the same patch of trees when they are matured, thus they are able to produce on a finite amount of space, without having to expand.  The faster a tree can grow the less space is needed to get the same amount of logging.  In fact, forest coverage over the world has increased over that last 80 years.  Not only is this push for efficiency (doing more with less) true for the logging industry, but is true for all industries.  And as technology improves, so does the environment.    Outrageously, he says that the average worker in developed countries are worse off due to free trade.  Any check on the facts shows this to be clearly false.  Todays average citizen in any developed nation has so much wealth as to be incomprehensible to anyone who lived 100 years ago.  In fact, we live in a time of such abundance that even those who can afford cell phones, cars, microwaves, refridgerators, cable TV, etc. are considered to live in poverty.  Another of his 'reasons' on the fallacy of free trade is that none of the developed countries developed in the absence of government intervention.  While this is true, what he ignores is that the developed countries developed in an economic atmosphere of substantially less government intervention than in the past.  In all of economic history, all around the world, governments have controlled and directed the economy.  But most technological and commercial advances took place when governments were weak.  As a result, the idea of personal liberty was established during the Enlightenment period.  When this took place, the economies of the Western world exploded, giving them the capital to explore and develop.  This is the primary reason for the dominance of the West.  Another idea about the evils of capitalism and free trade is downsizing.  Companies downsize because they can do more with less.  The agricultural revolution means that 1 or 2 people can create enough food for 98 or 99 people.  This frees up the 98 or 99 people to do other things besides worry about where they are going to get their next meal.  Today, the manufacturing sector in America produces 95% more than it did in 1970, with only 75% of the people in manufacturing during the 1970s.  This means that productivity per worker increased by more than a factor of 2.  When this occurs companies will naturally lay off workers.  Instead of viewing this as an evil, it should be viewed as what it actually is: allowing labor to go where it is most needed.  Due to the efficiency of agriculture people were free to work on other things (creating the division of labor), like manufacturing, and creating newer and better services, instead of toiling away on the farm.    I can't remember all of his 'reasons' since I wasn't foolish enough to buy this book, but all of his other 'reasons' are just as weak in fact and logic.  Don't buy this book.  All but 2 or 3 sentences are wrong 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 Tried attaching this to my tile sink splashboard... never would hold. Tried reattaching several times and would consistently fall off 
 The camera operates good, but I thought it was suppose to be new.  It looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom.  It does work, but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out 
 I've never heard of the "Bell Witch" before, and this movie didn't really get me interested enough to care.  Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek must have needed a payday real bad to appear in this clunker: parts of it are so unintentionally funny that they should cut and spliced into the next "Scary Movie" they make.  The director, I guess, didn't realize that a lot of people have seen that movie "The Exorcist".  (Remember?  With Linda Blair?  Oh yeah!) The scene that was bust-a-gut-laugh-till-you-vomit was when the girl is picked up by her hair--you can actually see a wire or something for a minute--and dangled in the air.  It looked so unbelievably fake that I began to see this more as a comedy than anything else.  Is the entity so mad that it wants to glue the hair of young girls together (maybe a deleted scene has her waking up covered in spitballs).  The ending, however, and what is implied about Sutherland's character is not one bit funny and struck me as unnecessarily morbid; also, the performances and general plotline before can't support an issue as serious as incest or child abuse.  I guess at some point this was so obviously a clunker to everyone in the crew that the decision was made to throw something really sick into the plotline.  It didn't save the movie.  The only creepy scene is the ending.    
 The authors have made a great effort writing this book, which is divided up in two parts: macro- and microeconomics. It gives insight of how we should understand current economic affairs on both the macronomical and micronomical levels. The book does serve this purpose quite well. I particularly liked the summary at the end of each chapter. The book does however lack in solid economic theory, which makes this book inconsistent. If you are an economics student I would not recommend it for you to actually study economics (there are better books around for that), but merely as a reference to understand that theory is what you learn at univerity, and understanding the theory in practice comes usually afterwards. The big lack of this book is that it is only based from an American point of view and thus is not very useful for anyone living outside the US. Even the international economics chapter won't satisfy your desire to really understand what's is actually going on (when you don't live in the US). What this book totally fails to point out is that the US economy is very different to most other economies in the world. On the whole two stars were awarded for this book, as I think that it is very useful to  help your understand the current economic affairs. At the same time it fails in providing solid economic theory, it is based far too much on the US economy, and it is incomplete on other parts. Yet, if you live in the US, are studying economics and want to understand what it all means in practice, this book will help you! If not, don't bother 
 This movie was terrible.  The only reason im giving it any stars is because i love tupac but thats it.this movie basically has no story line. if you want to see a good tupac movie then you go buy juice. i think u will enjoy that alot more than u will in this movi 
 where are all of my magazine subscription first issues???????  mar 
 Just in the first few paragraphs alone she makes the same point about the smell of the slave market not being quite as strong because of the cool weather 3 times.  It seemed like a redundant effort to fill pages with nonsensical information.  If she had a better editor who helped her catch these errors she could concentrate on making an even deeper more rich story which I believe she desperately wants to accomplish.  Sorry to say I won't be reading another of her stories again 
 I was certainly looking forward to reading this book.  While I haven't read any of the other books written by this author; his reputation preceeds him.  Unfortunately, I was wholly unimpressed by his approach.  I find the writing style very unnatural for mathematics.  It can be difficult to follow the long, rambling sentences with his strange turns of phrase.  While I can appreciate that this is modern writing, the style is inappropriate for the subject.  Mathematics must be presented clearly and accurately.  I left the book thinking that the author didn't understand the subject very well himself.  It's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here.  Sadly, there are much better alternatives to this one.  If you have a mathematical background the book may irritate you with it's style.  A pity though, it is a wonderfully rich and interesting subject 
 The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are "what's for dinner tonight," and "what will the plumber work on next."  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like "modicum" and "greasy spoon" I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back 
 As stated by numerous other readers, the characters in this book bear no resemblance whatsoever to those that Jane Austen created in her own novel. Even the characters that appeared in the original Pride and Prejudice seem so completely and utterly changed, the only thing they seem to share at all is a name.   From a semi-historical standpoint, Aston does trot out a few colloquialisms and descriptions that seem realistic, however the behavior and actions of the characters themselves are completely anachronistic. It was laughingly sex-fueled and over-done, more of a Harlequin corset-ripper than any homage to Austen's fabulous creation. 
 I purchased these but had to return them.  while the molded strap is adjustable, it only opens up approx. 1".  The magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5" or larger around - at the eyebrows, forget it, these will not fit you 
 Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHY WE GARDEN as an almanac of helpful tips from a Pacific Northwest gardener's decades of experience, along with musings on the "Zen of gardening", & yet it is much, much more -- it is the story of how to take inspiration from the history of the written word, & epiphanies from global cultures.  Come walk with this gardener (who, by the way, talks to whales) as he plants a treeling that will live a thousand years, & get a glimpse of TIME as you've not known it.  Come sit a while in his gardens while he shows us the "temporal charisma" of the PLACE wherein we finds ourselves.  Come wander in this gardener's wonderings as he unearths the roots of our ancient yearnings about paradise to our more recent ideals of utopia.  Month by month, Jim Nollman takes us out where the wild things grow,  where spirit, mind & body come together in the most enduring of our "pastimes" -- digging up healing, planting hope & harvesting contentment.  WHY WE GARDEN is a mystery -- no matter where we do it -- atop highrises,  in window boxes, on city blocks, or where the trees outnumber the houses -- wherever we garden, that is where we dig up our souls & nurture our own unfurling.  Much to learn, relish, think on -- all year long, for the rest of our lives. WHY WE GARDEN is the perfect gift for your gardening friends 
 I have to say that the most disapointing part of this translation is the authors atempt to render into english the Shi'ur Qoma...not only are the voces magicae mangled and rearanged, but the author's little or no knowlegde of hebrew only produced incoherant statements in scatterd form.  Really, this is a VERY BAD TRANSLATION.  The only aspect of this book worth anything are the reproductions of the mystical diagrams and illustration 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 C. Loring Braces's review above is a rehash of his review in the newsletter of the National Center for Science Education.  It is a remarkably uncritical review.  Dr. Brace stresses Dr. Graves role as a scientist.  But he is also a professor of African-American Studies.  Although the book shows impressive scholarship, it seems more of a political tract than a scientific one.  To suggest that race is merely a "construct" is facile and wrong.  This is a political line of the left that does not gain credibility merely by repitition.  It is also a line imbued by disingenuousness.  To paraphrase:  race is a mere construct invented by the white race to justify the racism that is a characteristic of the white race.  Dr. Graves is to be commended for his openess about his hatred of Sir Frances Galton, but that does not make it palatable.  To blame Galton for Hitler's use of the word "eugenics" implies that Hitler's motivation was what he claimed and that he was not opportunistically stealing a term from science.  Why do people give Hitler so much credit intellectually?  Why can't they recongize that his motives were baser than he claimed?  The connection of Galton with Hitler's later use of the term "eugenics" has always been nothing but a cheap shot 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 Beautiful pictures, impenetrably dense text. I got this because of all the great reviews, but I have to disagree with them. I was expecting "how to create a cottage garden," but this is more like "two dozen cottage gardens and the two million plants that are in them." It was information overload, and yet not very informative. I was very disappointed. I returned this and got _Cottage Garden_ by Elisabeth Arter, which was much cheaper and much more what I was looking for 
 I made the mistake of purchasing his older book called The A.R.T. of making babies updated edition. Do not buy unless your doing a research paper. This book was written in 1998 and the information is outdated. Make sure you purchase the 2005 edition. I wish amazon.com would have made this clearer. I did read it anyways and had the book  been filled with updated information it could be informative. I found the "Couple's guide to In Vitro Fertilization a much better book. Having recently gone through the procedure it was right on the money and very easy to read and understand 
 I sat down in Borders and read this in half an hour.  I am a huge Tolkien fan, and know all his works backward and forward, and this was such a terrible thing to see shelved in the bookstore.  It mistranslates names, gets dates and events screwed up, and is simply a terrible reference material.  If you want to know about Tolkien's Middle-earth, pick up Tolkien's books and *read* the things.  Don't take this crappy short-cut 
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 I know I am not a traditional watercolor painter but I thought I could learn something from this book - given the glowing reviews I had read. Well.... right off the bat, the paintings Whitney uses for his examples, are horrible! its really hard to learn from a painting teacher when you don't like their paintings. He writes pretty well and poetically and seems to really love watercolor. Its just you do not see him putting his words into practice with his work and that makes it really hard to get into what the guy is saying 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 This book sheds little light on the Hollywood scene in Welles times and contains little on Welles' personal life or makeup.  Rather it supplies endless, scene by scene trivia on how Welles saw his dramas develop.  A good book for a collegiate motion picture major but a bore for the general public 
 This book is possibly the stupidest book I have ever read. The stories are boring with no plot or character development. Do not read this book 
 Raymond Feist likes to take his time developing a story, that's for sure. Just like his other series, Feist takes a pretty good idea and drags out the climax for well over a 1000 pages. I liked the concept started in the first book and even appreciated the character development carried into the second in the series. However, by the third book I was was saying to myself, "Please get on with it!" As I step back and look, nothing but character development happened in the the first thousand or so pages. A couple minor adventures and the retrieval of several old characters from Midkemia's past prepare us for a major conflict that still has not become clear. I wish I could give this a higher rating because the ideas and twists are respectable. However, this could have been a two book series and given the reader a lot richer and faster paced diversion. 
 I am an MBA student with no financial background (having received my BS in a completely different field), this was the required text for my Corporate Finance class and it left me so confused I had to withdraw from the class so as not to ruin my GPA.  The text is of no value to students like myself that need to learn the basics in order to understand what the authors are talking about. Surely there's a better book out there somewhere for Professors to select for their students 
 Just when you thought every rediculous theory had been put into print, here comes Sally McFague and her organic model of political correctness.  Can we please have more new definitions for everyday reality?  Before I  read this book, I had no idea that I was a morphic descendent of the  protozoan patrea conspiracy.  If you don't already hate old white men in  America, and you're looking for a reason to, buy this book, and get your  carpet cleaned by Sally McFague 
 I received two sizeable chunks of Karma soap in a couple of my orders and I thought I'd give it a go.  EEEEP - there's a whole bunch of patchouli in there (which I hate, but still thought I should at least try).  Maybe I'm overly sensitive to the patchouli but it was so strong.  The soap as a whole smelled like a sickening mix of syrup-y orange soda mixed with that dreaded patchouli.  To be fair though, you CAN smell different elements in it and appreciate it for that.  Aside from this, this soap melts incredibly fast.  Even if you keep it in a draining soap dish, even if you take it completely out of the shower, away from the steam,  it still melts at an alarming rate!  I can see how people (who love herbal scents) would like this.  It IS a unique scent that has depth and layers to it,  but it's just not for me 
 the book anywhere but here shows a mother who is capricious and unfulfilled trying to find a life for her daughter which she didn't have for herself.  i found it confusing that the book jumped around and didn't have much of a plot.  the boring unemotional character ann august who takes up much of the book keeps the book at an uneventful state, leaving you feeling like you don't want to finish the book.  there were many parts that could have been left out and seemed unnecissary 
 (Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)   O. K.   Get ready.   Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....   This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!  Yergin's "hydrocarbon man" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)  My advice:  Buy this book!   Buy it today!   Read it as soon as you receive it!   The next day may be too late!    (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)     Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer 
 Very frustrating book to read.  The idea of the book is great--that the self-help business has gone too far and allowed people to cop out of their own personal responsibility.  But the execution of the book is filled with poor research, weakly-drawn conclusions and hypocrisy.  The chapters on love and the family are particularly bad.  Though he claims unconditional love is hogwash and that family interests should rise about individual interests within the family, by the end of the chapters he is preaching the same old self-help message that he claims to condemn.  He even praises bad parenting and then uses his own problem kids as an example.  The book doesn't deliver what it claims to sell.  It doesn't practice what it preaches.  And, worst, it uses a few oddball research studies to attempt to draw conclusions that are just not supported through most research.  So if you are buying the book based on the title or description, beware!  It ends up being a pretty traditional self-help book that preaches a traditional psychological perspective with a lack of moral perspective. 
 I have a large interest in this subject, but the book was like a text book to me, instead of a story teller.  Could just be me. 
 sadly i feel tricked....yes michael buble can sing but the cd is short and the songs are not so good. reading other critisims posted  i see my feelings are shared 
 Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft.  "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl," he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel "What I Loved," an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City.  I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress.  The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her.  Don't judge Hustvedt by this one 
 A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations 
 I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one.. 
 The book has very nice Cover Page ! unfortunately that about it..and nothing else ! the contents is not very good, there almost no illustration, no picture, no example...just word after word like a Romantic novel while the reader is searching for the Feng Shui solution.     I don't like it ! 
 This book is a disappointment.  It is of some interest to Raider fans, but it doesn't really have much in the way of special information.  However, the first chapter is fantastic.  I'm sure the author's editor told the author to take that chapter out of chronological order and make it the first chapter because it's a great story 
 I flipped through this at the Midnight Special in Santa Monica and alighted on the chapter on finding an agent, since I was looking for a new agent at the time (and am still looking). When the author recommends going to writer's conferences, because agents often attend them, I tossed the book back on the shelf with a snort of derision. This book presents a superficial overview of various subjects and doesn't have nearly enough concrete examples, like a full book proposal or sample query letters. This is the same old stuff I've seen in every other writing book 
 I found this book overly verbose; not good for a minimalist. Also they pay no attention to people who just use the email for fun and communication. 
 As others have said, the side flaps should be glued on the OUTSIDE of the envelope.  It's very annoying when you're trying to insert CDs because they get caught between the side flap and the back of the envelope.  Bad design 
 There's simply nothing useful in this book. One would have to have never heard of the Internet or the Web, and never to have worked anywhere, to benefit from it. The author repeats infosec and management bromides ad nauseum, waves the bloody flag of 9/11 to puff up the importance of the field, and introduces new acronyms faster than the Pentagon.  It's also frequently incomprehensible, due to the author's poor control of English grammar.  If you're in infosec, don't let your bosses read this -- they may think you're as full of hot air as Kovacich.  Also note that at least 3 of the 5 star reviews below are by sometime coauthors of Kovacich 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. No other ballet partnership is as legendary -- the fiery Russian defector and the graceful, aging English ballerina formed a bond on and off the stage that for several years practically defined romantic ballet. Thus, for this very reason, hardcore balletomanes should get this dvd. Many of us (including me) were too young to have seen Nureyev and Fonteyn live, so these videos are the only example to dissect the legendary partnership.  However, caveat emptor: this is NOT a "typical" Swan Lake by any means. You can argue that there is no "typical" Swan Lake -- the original production in 1877 was a failure. Some of the music went missing. After Tchaikovksy's death, the choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov restaged Swan Lake, and that version more or less is the Swan Lake audiences know today. There's lots of music, so most versions of Swan Lake use the "traditional" pieces.   Nevertheless, there are some different traditions of Swan Lake. In the Russian productions, the outcome is usually "happy" -- Rothbart is killed, and Siegfried and Odette are alive. In the productions used "everywhere else," Odette and Siegfried leap into the lake, and are reunited in the otherworld. I prefer the second ending personally, because I think it better matches both the story (the happy ending was enforced by the Tsar, and seems tacked on), and the music as well.  Rudolf Nureyev's 1966 film, however, is unlike any other Swan Lake I've ever seen. First of all, from the opening closeup (of Siegfried in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick) you realize this film is not going to follow Balanchine (and classical ballet's) creed of "ballet is woman." The first act is redesigned to incorporate a lot of solos and dance opportunities for Siegfried (Nureyev). The first act usually ends with Siegfried picking up his bow and arrow and going hunting with Benno. In this film, there is a long elegiac solo for Siegfried (using music that's usually used in act 2).   Nureyev even dares to tinker with the famous Act II choreography by Lev Ivanov. In the famous Odette/Siegfried Adagio, the melody is not repeated with the cello -- instead, there's another solo for Siegfried. Margot Fonteyn was born in 1919 so it's possible that the emphasis on Nureyev is due to Fonteyn's technical limitations at the time. And one notices that Fonteyn, as graceful and lovely as she is, is at times unable to cope with the famously demanding Odette/Odile role. For instance, Odette's solo in Act II usually ends with a series of turns and then Odette stands on pointe and holds a balance before going into the wings. Fonteyn doesn't attempt the feat, but ends the series of turns in first position -- flat on her feet. Fonteyn by modern standards also lacks the athleticism, bonelessness (her arms always look like arms, not wings), flamboyance, and flexibility, that one usually associates with this role.  Act III's music choreography is pretty standard, but the musical arrangements (and choreography) for the Black Swan Pas de deux are radically different. Fonteyn actually churns out the fouettes, confirming something I've long suspected: that everyone looks at the fouettes, but Odette/Odile's real challenges are the balances, footwork, and leaps, and this is where you can see Fonteyn suffer.   Strangely, Act IV (the act that is usually cut to shreds) is the most intact. And it's the best-danced act: it;s the reconciliation scene between Odette and Siegfried that one can catch glimmers of the genuine bond that existed between these dancers. Elsewhere, the technical limitations of Fonteyn by this time and Nureyev's reworking of Swan Lake as a solo showpiece for Siegfried distracted me from simply enjoying their partnership. I particularly loved when Siegfried runs all over the stage, turning up the head of each swan, to find his Odette, and when he finally finds Margot's head, it's a truly beautiful moment. The ending of Nureyev's version follows the original Swan Lake, and not the "usual" endings of the Swan Boat to heaven.  On a technical level, there are problems. The ballet was filmed on a soundstage, and seems way too small to fit a whole cpmpany corps. As a result, the dancers often look haplessly cramped and as if they'll bump into each other. The close bunching also detracted from the natural geometric shapes that are so much a part of classical ballet. The Vienna State Ballet also looks woefully underreheased. Either that or they're just bad. Their legs are terribly uneven in arabesques, their arms are a mess, and they simply look like a corps that hasnt danced Swan Lake enough. The sets are also deliberately artificial and the costuming, espeically for Nureyev and in the "color" acts, is garish. Rothbart (Redbeard here) is a non-dancing role, unlike in most productions when he's a smooth pimp-type in Act III.   For a traditional Swan Lake with a more modern Odette/Odile, I'd suggest the Makarova/Dowell dvd with the Royal Ballet. Makarova was 41 at the time of filming, but her long extensions, boneless arms, exquisite balances, and still impressive technique make her Odette/Odile much more appealing to modern tastes. This Swan Lake is of great historical value, and Fonteyn is undeniably lovely, but overall I admit I wanted a more traditional Swan Lake, and I certainly wouldnt recommend this dvd as anyone's first Swan Lake. Its just too unorthodox.  
 While Giroux asks a few good questions, I can't take seriously the suggestion that Disney animations are sexist, racist, or anti-democratic. Space limitations prevent a full rebuttal, but if Giroux went after Santa Claus, I bet he'd be a gluttonous, chain-smoking, reindeer abusing, elf oppressing, break-and-enter man with an unnatural fixation on young children. If you want to read how he does a job like this on "The Lion King" and other great movies, this is the book for you 
 That's what I feel after listening to this album... blah. I tried very hard to find this record's groove, but easy listening music is not my thing. EC the guitar God is most certainly alseep if not totally dead. The few times I heard his Stratocaster come alive, the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference.  The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been  written by any amateur songwriter. With such a great backing band and top-notch guests, this record should have caught fire and burned strong. The only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production.  To me it looks like EC has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing.  Very sad 
 When I print something in color it prints but it doesn't print the right color. It prints as if the color ink has run out. I wouldn't buy any color ink from here again

 This dialogue was PAINFUL to read.  My 9 year-old Goddaughter can write better dialogue in her stories that this stuff!  Luckily, I only paid 75 cents for the book at a clearance book sale.  Save your money.  Turns out this book wasn't even worth the 75 cents I paid for it!  
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 Dudes.  This is the worst ever.  You gotta be kidding me.  Life is short.  Don't do it to yourself.  Please.  Do not buy this album.  It is so cheesy it hurts.  Get some Heavenly, older Belle and Sebastian, the Beach Boys. If you like these guys then you probably like the Barenaked Ladies.  And if you like these guys and you say you hate the barenaked ladies, then you are a hipster.  My bad.  I am dumb 
 I wonder if she's going to "write" a second book called "Jessica Simpson I Don't:  Achieving Your Dream Divorce".  
 i love this author. this is the least of my favorites of his books though. i just couldnt read the whole thing. i think it was due to the fact that i was brought up in a southern baptist home and have a bad taste in my mouth from that.... this book reminded me of that time in my life with a lot of the same verbage and talk. it probably is just a person issue, but i love every other book that i have read of Mr. Stevens'! 
 Although I believe it was an honest effort, some of the information was misleading. A few of the authors views were in error as I know from experiance. (i.e. "a knife shorter than 3 inches is BS." I have seen people attacked and severely injured by screwdrivers and knives shorter than that.) There were some good points, and I'm sure that some people who have never been exposed to this will find the section on the use of a belt particularly interesting. Certainly NOT the holy grail of martial arts books though.  
 Was excited to buy this item as I had lots of dull knives made by several manufacturers (Chicago Cutlery, Victorinox, and Henckel). I tried both sharpeners and the steel does an OK job but the ceramic wheels (for "fine sharpening") butchered every blade i tried it on. When I was done sharpening the knives, the blades were jagged and looked like I was trying to cut concrete with them. Save your money on this one 
 Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book.  This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration.  This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures. 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 A good cast wasted. Poorly written, filled with every cliche of "life on the edge", the film never gives depth to the three characters whose lives are so deeply intertwined. Their feelings for each other are never illuminated, so we don't know why they are together. They yell and fight and act outageously, but they give us no reason to care about them. For this I blame not the actors, but the director who seems to have no idea how real life happens or how real people talk to each other. Salma Hayek comes off the best, though her charcter is unrelentingly irritating. Vincent D'Onofrio is good as always, a very intelligent actor. Thomas Jane is pouty and intense, but has the least well-written character to work with. And why is the movie named after him, when the center of this drama is not Gary (Thomas Jane) but Valentino (Vincent D'Onofrio) 
 This is a repeat of the first 2 books for the most part. I do understand that the "Rich Dad Classics" aren't meant for tips and specific methods of making money, but rather a rich mindset.  Mineset, but ANY specifics? No. They are his best kept secrets. You would have to attend his money making seminars (i.e. spend more money) It's understandable to emphasize the importance of mindset in a book or two, and I did really enjoy the original "Rich dad, Poor dad," but it seems like ALL of his books are just about the mindset. What good is a mindset if there is no real direction in executing it. Don't waste your time reading this book, it's also the thickest of the three. If you haven't already done so however, read the original "Rich dad, Poor dad. 
 Saddam Hussein has posed the United Nations (U.N.) with its greatest test since the Korean War. Security Council Resolution 687 may have mandated that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs and curtail its ballistic missile capability, but Saddam has treated U.N. weapons inspections with disdain, routinely preventing full, unfettered access, and finally, in 1998, refusing to comply altogether.  Deaver, academic coordinator at the Civic Education Project in Russia, correctly identifies international diplomacy's failure to limit Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program as worthy of study. Rather than analyze the history of the inspections regime or detail the U.N. Special Commission's success and failure, however, he examines power relationships, resistance, and the applicability of academic theory.  Disarming Iraq begins with a succinct overview of Iraq's weapons programs and the international response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (though his summary does little more than regurgitate Anthony Cordesman's uneven work). However, some of Deaver's subsequent speculation is curious. Who outside the sheltered world of academe would state that Saddam objected to chemical and biological weapons disarmament out of fear of being left defenseless in a tough neighborhood? (The Iraqi army retained its sizeable conventional forces and those ballistic missiles with under 150-kilometer range.)  Deaver then examines the monitoring duel between Iraq and the U.N., relying almost entirely on U.N. documents and granting them a legitimacy possible only from someone who has never observed U.N. fieldwork firsthand. Analyzing U.N. monitoring in isolation, Deaver fails to consider how the U.N.'s willingness to compromise encouraged Saddam's widespread obstruction. For example, in May 1996, the U.N. and Baghdad agreed to a memorandum of understanding diluting the substance of Security Council resolutions to enable the oil-for-food program. Iraqis who I interviewed repeatedly pointed out that if the U.N. responds to Saddam's obstruction by reducing his obligations, then Saddam will simply increase obstruction with regard to the weapons program the U.N. holds most dear.  Also missing in Deaver's study is any attention to Saddam's trade politics. It is no secret that Saddam directed billions of dollars in oil-for-food contracts to France, Russia, and key Arab states in exchange for Paris, Moscow, Cairo, and Damascus turning a blind eye to unrestrained erosion in sanctions.  Disarming Iraq is an example of academic self-absorption that provides little satisfaction to real-world international relations practitioners. It illustrates the growing schism between university and practical politics. Theory should never substitute for on-the-ground research.  Middle East Quarterly, Winter 200 
 .............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together.  The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society.  That cannot be true.  All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh.  I'm still thinking about that theory 
 Let me be honest up-front. I did not finish this book. I believe it is only the second book, of the 100+ I have reviewed, that I did not complete. I read the first several chapters and was so disgusted by what I was reading that I elected to merely skim the remainder of the book. After all, I'm a busy guy and have an entire shelf of unread books awaiting my attention. Why would I want to waste my time on what is, unfortunately, complete trash?  Escaping The Matrix by Gregory Boyd and Al Larson is, according to the cover, a guide to "setting your mind free to experience real life in Christ." The reality is that unless Christ requires that we use the latest in pseudo-occult psychological techniques to free our minds, this book will do nothing of the sort. Indeed it cannot, because much of the teaching of this book directly contradicts the Scripture.  The first clue to the trouble within this book came only two pages in, where the authors explained that the key to living a life freed from the chains of the past is to be found in The Matrix movies. In fact, the majority of the book is structured around the themes of the movies, and the authors are as likely to proof-text their teachings with quotes from The Matrix as they are from the Bible. The reader is even treated to a quote from one of the movies at the beginning of each chapter.  Instead of providing a detailed review (something I have disqualified myself from doing, since I merely skimmed much of the book) I thought I would provide an overview of the authors' technique for "setting faith for the true you." That should speak volumes in and of itself.  Escaping The Matrix culminates in an exercise that is designed to "help you collapse the negative Matrix-oriented faith that you are currently doing and install a biblically grounded faith about God's will for your life." There are seven steps:     1. Form a mental picture that re-presents you doing an emotion, attitude or behavior that you believe needs to be changed in your life. Once you have it, set it aside and perform a pattern interrupt.    2. Ask God to give you a picture of what you would look like if you manifested the truth of who you are in Christ. Take a snapshot of this you and enjoy the photograph.    3. Delete all background elements of your future picture and change it to be made out of diamond. Place the negative picture in front of the positive picture so you can see the negative through the positive.    4. See Jesus' hands grasping the positive picture and smashing it through the negative. Hear and see it burst ito pieces and fall to the ground.    5. Now see Jesus and you sweep up the broken glass. Dump the pieces into a wastebasket and see and hear Jesus congratulate you for getting rid of a Matrix lie.    6. Gaze on the positive picture and make it bigger and brighter. With your internal voice, say to your soul that you and the Holy Spirit together will make thie positive picture happen.    7. Ask God for His wisdom to help you discern things in your life that need to be altered to ensure the true you is manifested.  I suppose we are supposed to set aside our reason and believe that this is biblical methodology. Strangely, however, I can find no examples such in Scripture. And what's more, I know of no examples in all of church history. It seems Larson and Boyd have stumbled onto some critical knowledge that has been hidden from us until discovered by the Wachowski brothers and digitized into a series of sex-and-swearingf-filled R-rated movies. The Lord truly must work in mysterious ways for this to be true.  But instead of ranting and raving about this, I thought it would be more profitable to direct you to a much more helpful, educated review. Regardless of whether or not you intend to read this book, I would encourage you to read Dr. Mike's Review at Eternal Perspectives (do a Google search). Mike uses great words like neuropsychology, experiential psychotherapy, and soteriology and suggests that "this book is the latest of a seemingly unending chain of psychologically- and psychotherapeutically-informed attempts to facilitate sanctification. Some of the points made are true and valuable; at the same time, it commits some serious, prevalent errors concerning the nature of salvation and sanctification in the Christian life."  Needless to say, I recommend this book only as kindling. And even that is too good for it 
 After waiting 3-4 weeks, it finally arrived! To my grandchildrens dismay. It did not perform as advertised. There wasn't any volcano erupting, all it did was sprinkle a small amount from the side. Yes we did have good water pressure, and it was put together correctly! I just want my money and shipping charges back! Thank you for your expediency on this return 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 Have these authors ever done any animation? Have they ever SEEN any animation? This mostly contains carefully rendered fantasy drawings that you would never see animated. How they got this published is beyond me 
 Really no one should really own this piece of filth. The images(pornography) are disturbing and really quite offensive. It is a sin just to view this with out ignorance of its content. Regardless, the DVD offers hardly any actually information on the pistols' career, but rather just shows all these performances of the band. It as well shows some cartoons which in those days, it would be unheard of to have the pistols animated.  Not really an essential for a normal fan, but it is still yet entertaining. It reflects the band rather well 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I ordered the 5 piece ble set on MARCH 18th and still haven't received this. I keep on getting an email that it is on back order and I now won't get it until JUNE 30th. Costumer service is ridiculous, I was told it would take 3-5 days that's why I ordered it. DON't get it, if you need it within one yea 
 I regret buying this book.  It covers a lot of material but has very little about each item.  If you really need the detail look elsewher 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely. 
 While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal 
 This portable TV sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design.  They don't tell you that there is NO ANTENNEA nor that the TV will not work without an antennea!  The portable DVD player is great. THE TV IS HORRIBLE.  When we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken.  DON'T BUY THIS FOR THE TV!  We ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in.  This one was a total waste of money 
 I have read all of Anne Rice's books that were released under her real name and have thoroughly enjoyed every one.  One day I decided to try one of her earlier works written under a pen name to see what it was like.  I was somewhat disappointed.  I understand that this is early writing and it shows in that she has not yet developed her prose to the levels that you find in her vampire, witch, and other novels.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the novel reads more like a romance novel than erotica.  I actually find some of her passages in her latter works that skirt with the subject of the erotic more exciting than this less veiled attempt.  In all honesty, I didn't finish the book.  (By my own scale, I should have given it one start, but I'm cutting some slack here because it's Anne Rice.)  The reason:  boredom.  There just wasn't enough here to hold my interest.  I'm not particularly into bondage or S & M and the storey itself didn't interest me enough to continue on to the bitter end.  My star ratings:  One star - couldn't finish the book Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the author Three stars - enjoyable read.  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection.  Would judge other books by the author individually. Four stars - Liked the book.  Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author. Five start - One of my all time favorites.  Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author. 
 Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists. 
 The cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic. The cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use. So I called Coby. They said I'd have to PAY THEM to send me a replacement! My advice, don't bother buying COBY 
 Jon Katz is an idiot.  Anyone who sells him a dog better be prepared for him to kill the dog rather than deal with any issues.  Although this book is being sold as a nice dog story, it is anything but.  Jon Katz once again decides to kill his dog rather than put himself out.  (In an earlier book, he killed his supposedly beloved labs because he couldn't bear to see them anything less than 100% healthy.)  In this book, he decides to kill his supposed "soul mate" dog Devon AKA  Orson, because he does not want to be bothered to manage the dog's enviroment.  Orson bites a couple of people, and Katz decides he doesn't want to be bothered keeping the dog in an enclosed yard because it would "be a prison".  If you are a dog lover, do NOT buy this book.  You will just be pissed off by Katz's behavior.  
 Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful? I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world 
 I am a big fan of Dick's. His short stories are his strength, his imagination is superb, but this novel is peculiar to say the very least. I am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing. Sometimes he soars, but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought. This is just such a book. How it won the John W. Campbell Memorial award for the best novel of 1974 is beyond me. It would never get published today.  The beginning is classic Dick: a famous man wakes up in  a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn't exist. No records, no biography, fame all gone, a pocket full of money, that's it. But from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another. It's all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story. The policeman in the title doesn't show up until halfway through. Granted, the story picks up a bit at that point, but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one. The whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination. How disappointing is that? That's as bad as  those Star Trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell, they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal PTSD, but then the loop is completed and it's as though none of it ever happened. Arghhh!   If you think Dick was one of the great Sci-Fi masters of all time, read this book, but keep it in context with his corpus of work (i.e. somewhere in the bottom half). If you are just starting to read Dick, skip this one for a while. But by all means read his short stories. Some of them are keepers for all time.  
 Wills, like most Christians, ignores a clear fact staring him in the face - from the historical records, context and even what is called the "New Testament" itself.  Jesus was a Pharisitical Jew, who believed in the clearly defined tenets of faith of the Pharisites who were the majority of the Jewish population at the time - and represented the lower classes and the vast majority of the Jewish population.  If he went astray from "Judaism" it was because of his attacks on the Zadokic Priestly orders of the Temple - a dislike which he shared with the Pharisitical sages.  And he was not apolitical because his brother Ya'akov ("James" is a known historical figure who was put to death and was a leader in the Jewish Great Revolt.  I think well-meaning Christians should finally - after 2000 years - stop using this poor, sorry man from Nazareth whose mother was a simple hairdresser for their own personal agendas: left, right, Catholic, Protestant.  He was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as a Jew (except for a few bizarre behaviors) - not as a Christian or a member of the new faith, but as a leader of the Jewish people  (albeit a slightly blasphemous and strange Jew). That is all that Jesus really meant 
 This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as "an offshoot of Islam", and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes 
 Aerosmith is basically another mediocre, radio-friendly pop band that would have thankfully faded away if it wasn't for the Rap/Rock group Run D.M.C. redoing one of their songs "Walk this Way" in the 90s.   Aerosmith owes alot of their success to Run D.M.C., who put new life into on of their drab, uninspired songs.  Run DMC was huge at that time and gave Aerosmith the life they have now.  I doubt they could have made it this far on their own without that rap-rock song hybrid that was first created with one of their older songs with Run DMC.   Albeit, if you are an Old burn-out living paycheck to paycheck then this album is probable for you 
 I bought this book after hearing a radio interview with Beth Teitell. The time and money spent on looking, paying and shipping the book were a waste. The only stories that I could relate to werethe swimming lesson where she didn't know the nursery rhyme and improvised and singing the Brady Bunch theme song, because she couldn't remember any others. The rest of the book (and I admit I only got half-way through before I tossed it) was horrifying.  Getting mad at your children for turning OFF the television? Telling your in-laws not to let your children nap, so that you have quiet time when you get them back? Hiding the fact that it's Halloween? Seriously, what kind of a person does this? And her husband is a pediatrician. If you are as selfish as the author, you shouldn't have children in the first place 
 I misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle. It isn't. Apparently, the dimensions include the packaging. She loves Wheel Of Fortune on TV, and I thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands. Very disappointing. I'll be returning it, unopened. 
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
 This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 From the back cover:  Miracles do happen!  Award-winning actress Mary Steenburgen (TV's JOAN OF ARCADIA, HOPE SPRINGS) gives a solid performance as Ginny Grainger, a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of Christmas, thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six-year-old daughter Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois) and Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), Ginny's very own guardian angel. Ginny's wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past Disney favorites. ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS fulfills all your most treasured Christmas fantasies. Share it with those you love.  And my review:  I'm such a sucker for Christmas stuff. I probably own more Christmas books and movies than regular ones. So this review is not from a "Bah Humbug!" Scrooge. And I don't expect all of my Christmas films to be "happy happy joy joy" all of the time. My absolute favorite of all time is IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which can be very dark in places.  First off, I don't think that the acting was bad in this movie. And the cinematography was pretty good as well. I made my judgment based on the content and the storyline, which, in my opinion, flopped.  What I really found annoying was the way Ginny, the heroine, was constantly being villified. For example, let me paint you a picture of her life: her husband was laid off and hasn't worked in six months. They have two young children. She's making minimum wage, and they're barely scraping by. They've also been evicted from their home (since it's owned by her husband's previous employer) and are forced to move in with her father-in-law. They have very little saved in the bank, and yet her husband wants to take out $500 to buy Christmas presents for the kids. She understandably balks at the idea. First of all $500 is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids, even if you're rich. Unless you want your kids to become spoiled! (Remember, this movie was originally made in 1985, so that number is even more outrageous. Plus, they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own. I think that she's being reasonable. But she's painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys.  Then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop, and possibly go into debt to own his own business. Again, she's villified for being the only responsible one, and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck. After all, they may need their savings to survive. This is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out (and usually don't, since most small businesses fail in the first year). But no, she's shown to be a mean, cold-hearted witch for saying this. Grr. It was just so irritating. Yes, you want to give your kids a magical Christmas, yes, the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop, but you have to be responsible, especially when you have children to feed the clothe. I don't think she was being a Scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult (she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts, after all), but the film painted her as such.  And this film was so depressing. It felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down. The happy ending was a long time in coming.  Also, I'd be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children. I certainly wouldn't want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me, run away from home in the middle of the night, or talk to creepy-looking strangers in trench coats. That's how kids end up abducted or killed! Not really realistic.  I really expected better from Disney, especially when I really loved one of their other Christmas movies, THE SANTA CLAUSE. There are way better Christmas movies out there. See my list "Christmas movies that I watch every year" for movies that are worth your time and money. I don't recommend ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS. If you're still determined to watch it, try to rent it first, or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money, like I was. 
 Harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be, and I was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end....and found out there was nothing.  Just a worthless rant 
 I really REALLY liked this band. It's just sad that this album sounds nothing like the other ones. This no longer classifies as "Love Metal". I would call it "Pop". Every song sounds the same. There is no more crunch, hard lyrics, or amazing music. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs on this album. But the song that the album was named after sounds like Tinkerbell went to Fairyland. Every song just blends into the next one. All of their other albums I gave 5 stars too, this one just didn't make it. 
 I read the Millenials Rising book and I have to say that I found that a lot of the things that were said in this book to be very dated and, for the most part, not revelant to today's teenagers and young adults. One thing that I've noted is that a lot of things have happened since the publication of this book, 9/11, the war in Iraq, etc. and it doesn't jibe with me that the authors stated that the entertainment the Millenials enjoy are "squeaky clean" which doesn't explain the popualrtiy of subsequent shows such as "Chappelle's Show", or "Boondocks" both of which are highly controversial.  I also get the impression that the authors only spoke to a certain group of people which undercuts the assertion that this is the make up of a generation as a whole and I get the feeling that there are other voices that were being ignored of a lot of subjects(such as Columbine) and doesn't really tell the whole story.  I think that this is a very poor book to look to understanding today's youth and, as such, I do not recommend it to anyone 
 I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan and I was very disappointed with this book.  Too predictable, very depressing...  
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 I expected better from these authors.  They, however, left me very disappointed. I thought I'd get some basic and practical advice.  What I got was stroking and dreams topped off with a push for philanthropy from the earnings they don't tell you how to make.  I resent that Hansen and Allen made a dime off me for purchasing this book.  I should have read the reviews BEFORE I purchased. I would have saved myself time and money. Anyone what a free used copy?  Never mind.  It's not worth the postage 
 I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months. In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book reads like the blog of some angry person who ignores evidence to the contrary and embraces anything that agrees with him.  It was very hard to take seriously 
 Great movie, excellent acting!  Annette Benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the White House.  He seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist, of all things, and though their relationship is open and above board, the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection.  Politics are ugly, but truth prevails in this optimistic movie.  My husband and I love this one and we have watched it many times.  We always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics.  Easily one of my favorites.  
 "Longwinded.  Tedious. Impossible to finish (there was a reason Flaubert never finished this either) 
 I hated this movie. It was unrealistic and unbelievable. Also, Julia Roberts is a horrible actress and more than slightly resembles an opossum. 
 This book is nothing more than a great brochure. Too many "holes" in this one 
 Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controlers from now on,   The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great, but again let me stresss this issue,...   it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller (that you just put batteries in, well at least you thought you did) die, and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight 
 There certainly are many ways in which maternity care in the USA could be improved.  But this author's recommendations are not among them.  Even an open-minded person is put off by a great deal of plain old misinformation in this book.  For example, an epidural does not (as claimed in the book) involve sticking a needle in the spinal cord - YOUCH!  Nor do women who have epidurals have more back pain afterwards than women who do not have epidurals.  Because it's the pregnancy stupid!  The book winds up being a colossal straw man.  Maybe someone else will write a truthful book incorporating factual information, rational analyses and sensible suggestions for improvement 
 I find it hard to believe that anyone actually wanted to publish this load of rubbish. Boring people with no character, fairly awful recipes, no plot  What's left ?  Comparing it with Like Water for Chocolate or Sex in the City is the worst kind of publisher's hype. I am SO glad I just got it from the library and didn't waste money on it 
 Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
 Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies.  Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc...  But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess.  Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep.  The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively.   Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you;  Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother. Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice. Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it. Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out. Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here. Big Edie: Did you feed the cats? Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!! Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice.   Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes.   Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients.  You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time.   Horrible. Just plain horrible 
 The book is probably great to those that know nothing about any psychological concepts.  But most of the information is already out there on the internet or in other psychological books.  This is definately not for people who already have done prior research.  Many of the ideas like finding your "inner child" seem somewhat implausible to me.  
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin. 
 As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there 
 Reading this 'leadership pipeline' I became really astonished of seeing here all the ideas of Elliott Jaques and Gillian Stamp (Bioss International) just copied with no reference to them. I keep wondering how can that be done. Jaques and Gillian Stamp has written for so many years about human capability and seven levels of work complexity that are clearly repeated in this book withouth no comment to them. Even the general themes are there, for example managing other, leader of leader, managing a business unit, managing a group of business unit. If you don't beleive me, just read Requisite Organization (Jaques) and previous ones, for example, and you will learn that Jaques' ideas are being developed for more than 30 years. So, better learn with the real creative people that has really done researches around the theme. 
 This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters.  Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span).   If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 I have to say it's really "basic". I didn't mean that it's worthless.But it's not worth the price. It suits the one who is interested in horsemanship but doesn't have any experience in riding . The major drawback is the pictures or graph are not enough  for the reader to make a precise and vivid image of what the author trys to present. And this is quiet helpful for novice riders.isn't it 
 Considering the reputation of this book, I was quite shocked to read some of the errors it contains with regard to Australia and New Zealand to the extent I cannot take for granted anything else within its pages.  A short list:   1. Anzacs, pie floaters and lamingtons are not "food traditions" bought from Britain by migrants and convicts.  All of them originated in Australia in the 20th century.  2. The swagman boiling potatoes in his billy can is a new one to me. Billies were generally used for making tea. Most swaggies did not get more than bully beef, flour, sugar and tea.  3. Anzacs are biscuits, not cakes.  4. The "pie floater" is a meat pie in a bowl of pea soup, not tomato sauce, and is not our national dish unless a national dish by definition is something almost universally derided and never eaten.  5. In what appears to be an attempt to cater for different terminology in different countries, the authors have put corn syrup in brackets after golden syrup. However, these are not the same thing, golden syrup being derived from sugar cane and having an entirely different flavour.  6. As above, icing and frosting are not the same thing.  Any attempt to make lamingtons with frosting will result in total failure.  7. In New Zealand, food is not "simple" meat and veg, but rather a reflection of the diversity of the country's population due to immigration.  In particular, food from Thailand, Malaysia and India is common and modern New Zealand cuisine strongly reflects its influences. The book's information may have been accurate 20-30 years ago, but certainly not now.  8. In New Zealand, kiwifruit is most certainly not eaten with every meal!  This is just a sample from the information regarding Australia and New Zealand and clearly demonstrates extremely poor research. The sort of nonsense you might expect from people who still believe Australians ride kangaroos to work.  I suppose for people who don't know any better, it's great, though to me it smacks of the Emperor's new clothes. I shudder to think that anyone has 100% faith in this book. Given Larousse's reputation (not to mention price) I expect a lot more. 
 This is an abyssally written, horribly researched, inaccurate, unorganized babble of idle gossip about some truly great artists and writers. The author should not attempt to write about things beyond his limited ken.  What a travesty that a publisher would agree to print such garbage 
 If you want to learn project management or get better at it, don't read this book.  It brushes over important concepts and spends and inordinate amount of words attempting to describe the profession. It assumes detailed knowledge, gives very poor examples and, in summary, is a total waste of time 
 I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250 
 This book tries to teach piano the way rock and folk guitar is often learned: it tells you to form chords by putting your hands in certain positions, giving short shrift to the principles of chord construction and  voicing and virtually ignoring the principles of voice-leading. The  inevitable result is a confused and unmusical pianist. For adults and older  children I use John Thompson's MODERN COURSE FOR PIANO. I often supplement  this with John Clough's SCALES, INTERVALS, KEYS, TRIADS, AND METER. I  advise those of my students interested in jazz and rock music to use Jeff  Burns's PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST 
 This book has several flaws that make it difficult for the reader to understand the author's message.  First of all, the book is not well organized.  It does not present material in an order in which the reader  can learn.  For example, the illustrations are not in a logical order, so  the reader is required to skip forward and backward many pages, and  sometimes chapters, in order to see the diagram that relates to a paragraph  of text.  The second major flaw is that there is no bibliography, and  references are alluded to only vaguely, making it nearly impossible for the  discerning reader to check the facts.  I would not recommend this book as a  first, or even second, choice for someone who is setting about to learn  this healing art 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 I am pro-Neal Schon.  I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date.  However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars.  It simply does not meet the mark on this one.    None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you.  These aren't songs that will stick in your head.  Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate.  If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by "Beyond the Thunder...." one of his best to date.  These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine.  Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.  I was disappointed on this one.  Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world.  He just didn't hit the mark on this one.  
 If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.  By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease 
 Michel Murray shows a distinct lack of knowledge of pathophysiology (alteration of body function due to disease). He fails to present balanced reviews of the literature on herbal supplementation leaving out well conducted studies which failed to show the benefits promoted in his book. Often his conclusions are based on opinion instead of scientific evidence.  Save your money and buy some other work of fiction. - William Joppa R.Ph., B.S. Pharmacy, North Dakota State 1985, Doctor of Pharmacy University of Minnesota 200 
 this fat a** can't rap. why does this get 4 1/2 starz? i have no idea. and if u think that she is a true rapper, then just watch one of her awful movies. sellout? whatev, dont buy this, spend some dough on one of the following: 50 cent- the massacre ja rule- r.u.l.e. any cd by lil jon he is great with beats and a truly great lyricis 
 This movie has its moments. Unlike most action flicks that tend to boast more action than a watered down story. This actually has a story worth paying attention to. However it follows the same formula as every other female action movie. She's fighting for some undergroung syndicate, the best asassin they have to offer, avenge someone's death, and nobody can beat her to include the one's who might have trained or are equally skilled. There are some cool shootouts and fights, but I'm kind of gettin sick and tire of this same pattern. If you want a real action flick, check Transporter 
 I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good 
 I read this book for a class on the Greco-Roman world. The book looks very interesting from the outset, attempting to do what is not done very often: combining the efforts of archaeology and Biblical exegesis to gain a more accurate picture of what is happening specifically in the Gospels. They cover what they believe are the ten most important discoveries (or so, they kind of smudge the lines a little bit by combining certain discoveries together, but they're up front about that, so it's ok) of both archaeology and biblical exegesis. Using these examples and many others, they attempt to show what Jesus was about and how his "kingdom movement" compared to that of John the Baptist's as well as the current empire of Rome at the time. They come to some controversial conclusions, but they attempt to back everything with evidence they give.  There are two major problems with Excavating Jesus. One problem is the form of the book. To put it bluntly, it is a poorly written book. In an attempt to put as much information into the book as they can, they tend to get lost in the information and the point they are trying to make is lost within the plethora of evidence and information. If you're looking for a casual read that will not require much effort on the part of the reader, this is not a book to pick up. The reader is required to sift through a lot of information and sometimes guess at what the authors are trying to get at because their point is not stated clearly enough. The chapters are very large, usually around 80 pages, and though each chapter is trying to focus on a specific point, by the time the reader is finished, they are somewhat lost as to what point the authors were trying to make. The thesis of the book itself is not easily discernible. The method is made very clear, but ultimately overshadows what the authors are trying to do. So the important messages that the book is trying to get across are lost in poor writing and direction.  The other major problem with the book is the conclusions. They are not bad because they are controversial; the authors make it a point to try to back everything they present with evidence. What makes the conclusions problematic is that they are all fairly extreme. If there is any room to doubt something, the authors immediately jump to the farthest conclusion. For example, there is little evidence to suggest that there is a synagogue in Nazareth at the time Jesus would have lived there as Luke records. The authors automatically conclude that the events that take place in chapter 4 of Luke didn't happen. That's a fairly extreme jump to make, and there are other plausible explanations that can be made. The book does this quite a bit.  Overall, the book is not good. It's worth reading if one is willing to take the time to sift through the poor writing, but if you're looking for a simple book about how archaeology and exegesis can work together, I would look elsewhere, though the selection is somewhat thin.  One positive aspect of the book is in the discourse of the first chapter about the James Ossuary. This is a fascinating discussion and I think an important on when it comes to good archaeology and exegesis. However, it'd be better to check the book out from a theological library and read that selection rather than purchase the book for that section 
 I'm a CIW instructor.  I've been using Prosoft courseware in my classes for two years, and have never been pleased with it -- especially the Foundations courseware.  This book is written by the same people and it's just as bad.  Dry as a bone and full of inane information that none of my students have ever been asked on an exam.  This biggest challenge on the Foundations exam for most of my students is the Networking Fundamentals portion and while this book does cover the needed material, it doesn't do a very good job of breaking down some of the most complicated concepts -- such as the OSI model.  I encourage my students to get supplemental materials that enhance the material covered in the courseware -- not rehash it 
 The frightening aspect of this work is that it is simply another glazing over of what Americans call the Vietnam War.  The sources consulted do not constitute anything resembling a full scope of available scholarship.  Americans do not understand the Indochina conflict because they are only allowed to see one side.  This book is simply another work in a long line of American political lore which has created convenient rationalization for complex events in Southeast Asia.  There are significant scholarly works available for the reader who desires true understanding.  This work is certainly not to be held among them 
 I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age 
 + sturdy construction + intro to many topics + problems at end of chapter have page reference of the answer   - shallow coverage of too many topics - some key learning points are left to the student in an intro book - poor formatting and organization  = an intro book that doesn't build enough on the foundations and tries to cover too much in this growing fiel 
 This book is severely dated. Several advances have been made in the area of sports specific training. Some of these excercises are down right dangerous. Serious injuries could result. There are some good stretching suggestions, but a beginner's weight-lifting book has safe excercises, for those looking to incorporate weight training with their judo practice 
 Superficially Evening's book appears to be all that anybody would ever need about Photoshop CS2.  In fact, it is an impossible introduction for people making the jump from a simpler program, say Elements 3.0.    The organizational structure is poor.    Many ideas are used before they are explained, a fatal flaw as a text, tho' excusable in a pure reference volume.  But "For Photographers" claims to be a text and not a reference.  Terms are slipped in for somewhere without adequate definitions.  And neither the table of contents nor the index are detailed enough to help somebody find most detailed topics.  I bought Scott Kelby's book after putting Evening's on the shelf, probably for good.  Kelby gives the info a photographer making the jump to CS2 requires, although his language is famously just a bit to glib 
 it is the worst thing i have ever purchased in my life time of livin 
 I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed 
 During the nonsense years of the bubble, most people who fell for the hype never went through a boom and bust period. Sure, some had lived through busts, but they may not have truly experienced it, and therefore had no history to learn from. My opinion is these three "prosnosticators" probably fall in this category. I remember telling an older dot com "exec" that I didn't believe technology acceptance moves as fast as the media was hyping. The response I got back is typical of what this book spews out. Unblinding optimism based on limited experience and with total disregard to macro economic and socialogical trends. It is my humble opinion that these guys are not aware of wave theory and should study up on it. I do believe that science, technology, and globalization will bring good things. However, I am humble enough to look back at history to give me small bits of wisdom on how to proceed into the future. Good things will come, but they will come over a greater time periods than what hypsters believe. In our future, there will still be boom and bust cycles. We have not all become superhumans just because the tech industry plays a bigger role in the economy and in our lives. Our minds are capable of dreaming up extraordinary scenarios faster than our beings are able to make them happen and accept them. Save your money, don't bother with this book. Reading this book is like accepting wisdom from the likes of Henry Blodget or Mary Meeker. Look to people like Buffet and Greenspan for wisdom not a bunch of rubes 
 This is his absolute WORST videos, not his BEST.  You are missing tons of classic moments such as:  When Doves Cry, Let's Go Crazy, Mountains, Girls and Boys, Batdance, Partyman, Scandalous, Automatic, Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?, Sexuality, I Wish U Heaven, Glam Slam, Anotherloverholenyohead, America, and Thieves In The Temple.  This is a crime.  When is the real DVD coming out 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 After I read the book and was very disappointed, I went on-line to write this review.  I find myself agreeing completely with the reviews that gave this book a low rating.  It is yet another attempt to espouse the virtues of the 12 step Overeaters Anonymous program.  While I think there are good aspects of the 12 step program and that it may help some, there are many that the program simply wouldn't work for, including myself.  Mainly, I think, because it mandates that you cut flour, sugar, and other foods completely from your diet.   I feel that this sets a person up to fail because one ends up feeling deprived, which leads to binging.  In fact there is a whole chapter in the book that talks about case studies and nearly every person mentioned has relapsed and is valiantly trying to get back to abstinence and lose the weight yet again.  I would suggest that instead of working a program that obviously isn't working, they should perhaps seek another solution, maybe in the form of professional counseling.  I would recommend "The Solution" by Laurel Mellin, which is a comprehensive support solution with groups and pyschologists around the country practicing the methods given in the book.  I have found this method much more helpful than Overeaters Anonymous ever was.  If OA is working for you, then I think that is great, but if you are like me and do not find that it fits you, I encourage you to look elsewhere.  The Solution is a great place to start, and if you want to check out the website go to WWW.Sweetestfruit.com 
 It is truly sad that people feel they need to use Amazon.com as a forum to vent their racial and religous bigotry.  Throughout history, there have always been poor, angry, simple-minded, ignorant people that have felt a need to scapegoat the Jews for their pathetic lot in life.  Those who gave favorable reviews to this anti-semitic piece of garbage (which REALLY is a terrible book to boot) are no different. The "International Jew" is a reminder both of how ignorant and disgusting human beings were, and how ignorant and disgusting some human beings can still be.  
 This book showcases the filthy ravings of a truly degenerate "human being."  Read it for insight into the mind of a truly depraved individual 
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 (...) weres the CCR and all the good music from the movie?! This is crap. why wouldn't they at least put acdc on there when there song was played during the comercial? makes no sence at al 
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 I purchased the book based on Dr Weil's endorsement. They may be good personal trainers but the book is impractical 
 Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass.  She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third 
 The book provides an extremely general overview of 50 destinations.  Omitted, (I'm guessing for security reasons ) is all of Africa, India, the truly interesting islands of Polynesia (mentions Waikiki) the entire Caribbean, Australia west of Sydney and Mexico.  Standard European capitol cities get the most ink. There is nothing here that could not be found in the first pages of a Let's Go. I was really hoping for a unique insight found nowhere else. It does list a festival or two and several activities for the given city. No hard specifics like maps, embassy addresses, specific lodging, addresses of restaurants esp open to single diners or specific city areas not to venture into after dark. Lists destinations well along the beaten path.  If you are a first time traveller tho, this might be a good armchair read.  
 I ordered Found 1 and 2, I expected some cute,sad,and sometimes heart wrenching reading material. I was very surprised to say the least. If the description of the book had include the phrases "excess profanity" and porn material enclosed" I would not have ordered them. I think you should warn readers that these books are XXX rated. 
 This book is very poor and I would recommend against purchasing it. This guide is seems to be written by seminar teachers, full of simple one-liners and cheesy analogies that don't really add that much to your understanding of strategy. Possibly a starter guide, but not recommended if you have already read anything on strategy 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 Like many people, I was introduced to WA by the incredible "Argus" album, so I was eager to see how they would follow it up. Unfortunately, "Wishbone 4" only disappoints in comparison. In addition to the band's incredible musicianship, the strongest point of "Argus" was the songwriting; unfortunately, the material here just isn't up to par, in fact, most of the album is pretty pedestrian generic 70's guitar boogie. While "Ballad of the Beacon" and "Everybody Needs a Friend" are first-rate, most of the songs here are throw-aways: "Doctor" and "No Easy Road" sound like Humble Pie rejects, "Sorrel" tries to evoke an "Argus"-style vibe in its imagery but fails due to an uninspired melody and indifferent performance, and "So Many Things to Say" (the worst offender) sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette deck in someone's garage. If you really love "Argus", this might still be worth a purchase for "Ballad..." and "Everybody...", but otherwise it's pretty slim pickings 
 This item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for 5-8 year olds.  You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order 
 ...doesn't make it a great toy. A lesson learned the hard way. This toy is unbelievably loud. So loud, my husband and I can't stand to be in the same room with our son when he's dancing (stomping) on it. So ridiculously loud, my son can't play with this toy inside at all anymore. Every time he moves, the songs start over. Grates on your nerves after the 5th or 6th stomp. What a disappointing toy. We've had it out of the box three or four times to play with. It is now hidden in the deepest darkest part of the hall closet until we make our next round of donations to Good Will. Save your money for one of the other good dance mat toys on the market. This one's a stinker 
 This book is a disgrace to academia. The author has yet to master the art of forming a coherent thought or sentence. He routinely writes in the vernacular, rather than a formal researcher's form. Topics are generally discussed by listing a heading, then inserting some ramblings which are devoid of proper paragraph structure and citations. Once you get past the dire lack of high school level composition skills, you find an author bent on slanting his readers toward his own views, which, unsurprisingly, are quite socialist.  Rather than begin with premises and present supporting arguments and research, he automatically assumes his own slanted view is correct. I find it hard to believe this book is published and used in classrooms, but I suppose the socialists have to make up for a lack of logical thought with print volume 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 It didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago, it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron 
 This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American  children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I  only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is  obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who  enjoy such material will like the book more than I 
 What a disappointment.  The TV series bears almost no resemblance to the book.  A few character names are the same and the "Carrie" and "Mr. Big" characters are drawn roughly the same as the TV characters.  All I can say is that the TV scriptwriters did an outstanding job at developing the series' well-rounded characters from this mess of a "book."  There is virtually no plot or character development.  The book is a collection of seemingly unconnected short essays in interview format.  Bushnell owes a debt of gratitude to the screenplay writer who was genius enough to take her twisted mess of words and turn them into the scintillating story that we know from the series 
 Just to let anybody who comes here from anywhere other than the somethingawful forums know, ALL the reviews below were done by members of the SA forums ("Goons"). I bought this book, because I fell for the crap, but it is poorly written, not funny, not interesting, and could have been done so much better that I'm almost angry at myself for buying it. Just a really mediocre effort, from a really mediocre writer. If you're really interested in this stuff, look it up on the net. This book is just a lame attempt by Parsons to get himself published, by any gimmick neccessary 
 Man, I always thought the guys who complained about the CD remastering of Dylan's albums were full of themselves. However, I was quite surprised that nobody sees the problems with this remastering.  I borrowed the remastered "Nashville Skyline" CD from a friend a few years ago when he found out I had never heard the album before. I listened to it a few times and promptly returned it, stating that it was really disappointing. It sounded like a short, poorly-recorded album of Dylan with a weird voice. When I tracked down a good turntable, I picked up a bunch of Dylan vinyl to see how other albums fared in comparison to the CDs. I finally got around to "Nashville Skyline" last month, and discovered that the album was pretty good. The sound quality was much better than I remembered, even though my vinyl copy is pretty scratchy. Then, I ordered the remastered CD last week, thinking that I didn't give it a good chance the first time...............  Oh boy! What a tragedy. The remastered CD is truly as awful as I remember. I could not believe that the CD could have been worse, so I did a track by track analysis. Turns out the entire CD suffers from problems not found on the vinyl. The CD has noticeable tape hiss, with attenuation of the higher frequencies, and a complete lack of punch. The real travesty is that some tracks sound like they have been remixed, as some instruments have been relocated and brought up or down in level. A real travesty considering the vinyl mix is pretty good. The remastering problems really "cheapen" the album overall.   If you have this album on vinyl, just listen to the first few acoustic guitar chords and how they have a "bite" to them on the record that is gone on the CD. It only gets worse from there. This is the only remastered Dylan CD I have been disappointed with. I regret buying the CD and will wind up making a CD copy of my record. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 This book is hard to find things in and doesn't seem extremely well-organized. Besides that, it's annoying because it looks like it was done on an old school typewriter. I thought I'd need it because I need to write a lot of papers for my classes, but it turns out I can just look in the journals I'm using for the citation style for the most part. 
 I first ordered this guitar in another color and after about a week of checking the mail with my little boy every day, I was informed that it was out of stock. I re-ordered in the bodacious blue and it came Friday. It literally came in the cardboard box that you would buy it off of the shelf in with no packing besides a plastic bag around the guitar like your newspaper would come in. There was NO PACKAGING SLIP. I took it out of the plastic and the body of the guitar was damaged around the edge. There was a little divit the size of a raisin where it looked like it had hit something pretty hard. There was literally slack in the strings, so they had to be tightened. It would not stay in tune and I would tighten the strings and you could see them loosen again immediately. My little boy began to play with the out of tune guitar that sounded TERRIBLE and the next day one of the strings broke!!! This toy is a piece of junk. The sales pitch says a fully functional guitar... great value for the money.... HAHAHA! I thought this would be a great starter guitar with little investment. I would only recommend this if you are needing a prop or decoration of some kind. It certainly isn't playable! I have no slip to send it back and what I would have to pay in shipping would probably be near what I paid for the thing. Don't waste your money!    
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 This book has very little to do with mediumship! At best it's a general overview of all things psychic. There are no instructions or exercises. Most of the chapters are on unrelated topics, even the chapters on mediumship aren't actually about mediumship and instead focus on why you'd want to become a medium, why you'll want to work hard as a medium, and ways to dress as a medium 
 I was very dissapointed in this book. I purchased this book at the same time that I bought "Memories of a Cuban Kitchen" and WOW what a difference.  Memories of a cuban Kitchen is all you really need to learn & cook real cuban food.  Andy doesn't have a clue! The only good part of the book is the beautiful cover of the flag 
 Unless you are burning to know more about Mr Rabinow.  The book reads more like a justification for Rabinow's ethnographic failure than like reflections upon his experiences.  Much better examinations of the  fieldwork experience are available.  Nevertheless, Rabinow does have an  interesting style and sense of drama which makes for a not unpleasant  reading experience.  Were the title not so misleading I would like the book  better but it should really be known as "Reflections on my Failure as  an Ethnographer in Morocco.&quot 
 Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of Beverly Hills 90210 but after purchasing this dvd i got so mad. Where have all the songs gone? Seeing this series with songs that you don't eaven know who is singing.  I just saw the pilot episode, i couldn't see the rest of it. It's really, really bad. Where is "Motion of love" when Brenda gets inside the disco all by herself ??????  Where are Technotronic, Transvision Vamp, where is Chris Isaak, REM, Betty Boo ??????  We waited a long time for this dvds and all we get is this piece of junk. Who did this and why????  Don't purchase this dvds. They are not worht your money. The bootlegs are better !!!! 
 This handsome volume badly disappointed me. I think the proper rating for the book is about one and a half stars, but I gave it two out of generosity.   If you don't have a printer and are looking to buy one, it gives a pretty good round-up of the choices, technologies, and papers. The problem with this kind of thing, of course, is that it is necessarily dated--so it can't really serve as a buyer's guide.  If you already have a printer--I have an Epson 4800--and a source of digital images, you won't find much information here about how to make great prints. The only section on the actual print making process shows the dialogs for one printer, probably the author's. Totally unhelpful unless you have that printer (and you've probably already figured out how those dialogs work if you have that printer).  The section on RIP software is way overview, and doesn't provide any decent guidance on how to proceed with it.  I'm not given to writing negative reviews, and I don't often return books (as I am with this one), but in the face of all the positive feedback for this book I feel compelled to provide my opinion. As I said, if you are looking to buy a printer, this might help you understand the basic technology issues (although the models have changed since the book was written). Otherwise, the only use I see for it is as a "gee whiz" coffee table book for would-be digital printers rather than a serious reference manual 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 This book is less about the Jerusalem that Bellow visited and more about himself.  Indeed, his presence is so pronounced that he appears more fascinated with his own perceptions than he is with what he is witnessing, or so it seemed to me.  While the writing is clear and vivid, I can now recall virtually nothing of what he describes, except for himself and his personal reactions - it is he who sees things more clearly than his hosts, etc etc.  After 100 pages, this is boring.  Alas, I got nothing out of this and it is also badly dated.  Not recommended 
 I thought the subject matter of the book was timely, important and accurate.  I enjoyed the thoroughness of the analysis and comparisons of leaderless versus typical organizations.  However, that's where the book really ends.  There's no real actionable data for leaders to take back to their companies, only the argument of what they are up against.  I would love to read a Part 2 to this book that completes the cycle.  That is, how modern companies can utilize these patterns to their advantage to grow in the market place.  I think there are extremely valid applications of this.  One example that stands out is Salesforce and AppExchange.    By developing Apex and adding a marketplace (AppExchange) for third party development, Salesforce is expanding its footprint and innovating through organizations they may never have previously had a relationship with 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 I recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when I sat down to read it. The subtitle is "Games & Puzzles to Stimulate Your Creativity & Imagination". Actually, there are only some  thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts'. However, my  biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy. The very first puzzle (p. 20)  has a mistake in it. Then in 'Mental Counting' (p. 161), the author claims  that the letters O and U are not symmetrical about the vertical axis. As  for 'Three-dimesional Dots' (p. 199) the text states "Below is a  collection of random dots." Unfortunately, the random dots have been  omitted. So much for "something remarkable" happening as the  author claims. And how's this for one of the three (yup, only three)  lateral thinking puzzles? What common word begins with IS, ends with ND,  and has LA in the middle? I bet that really stretched your brain, didn't  it? Sorry, but Mr. Wujec's editor should be fired. These glaring mistakes  and omissions have scuttled any enjoyment I may have expected from this  book. I suspect the author was motivated by the commercial success of his  previous book. He should have waited until he had something of value before  publishing this schlock 
 This is Mexican favorites from a corny old folks perspective.  It was neither classical or tejano, just tacky stuff.  I was very disappointed and returned it. 
 I was dispointed from seying this movie. After seing Wild Orchid movies, 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting Wide Sargo Sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it. The course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee. I did not get the point of this movie. it's worth renting. But I certainly would not buy it 
 this cd was my first dkm cd and at the time i loved it. then i got do or die and gang's all here. they made this cd look like the crap that it actually is. the songs are pretty much all the same except for the rocky road to dublin which is good but gets old fast. this cd gets old almost as fast as Flogging Molly did and that is pathetic. it almost seemed that this whole cd were just fillers. In this cd they really make it known that they are irish too but then in Boston who isnt irish. get do or die and gang's all here. if u like the irish music get some Real Mckenzies or Progues. dont succumb to the level of Flogging Molly and this cd. 
 Not funny enough to succeed as satire, and certainly not erotic.  When I read the blurb annoucement that this was a satire on Voltaire's CANDIDE, my first reaction was, "How do you write a satire of a satire?"  The answer is, you can't; and CANDY ends up as just another tired, outdated...book.  Don't judge Southern by this novel... 
 This movie could've been something, had they gotten some real actors, a script and a director. Well, they didn't, and this movie is an embarassment to mankind 
 FYI, this guy is not a real Indian-he is a white man pretending.  And he was never a member of a tribe, it was "honorary" and was taken away.  The AIM movement came out and said they don't want him speaking for them, that he's a "wanabee" and that they don't like his racism. If you don't believe me, go to their website.  They have a whole section on him and others like him.  That kind of make me not want to read anymore of his books.  I full believe that what was done to the Indians was very wrong, but I'd like to hear about it from a genuine source-like an actual Indian historian, not some fake who apparently hates his own race 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 The book is good in context but I when I got to the center of the book, it split in half.  Now the first half of the book falls out of the binder.  I'm going to have to remove all the pages, punch holes and put them in a binder.  This is a Guide that I will use and reuse frequently.  I'm disappointed that it did not hold up better.  I haven't even finished the class yet and I didn't abuse the book, just opened it to read and highlight certain sections.  Would you consider replacing the book 
 "Get Used to It" and "We won't stop" are TBNH releases that share the same category: boring music. Where's the energy? Where's the passion and love? Where's the catchy music? How I miss TBNH from Shelter and Brother & Sister!! 
 I decided to read a book on the five-hour flight from MCO to LAX, and then on the return flight of something less than five hours.  (Flying downwind eastbound, of course.)  I purchased "The Aquataine Progression" by Robert Ludlum, in paperback form.  (I must admit that I still can't get used to spending $7.95 for a paperback book!  But, the horrors of inflation obviously continue to haunt us into the 21st century, and beyond.  This promised to be worth the price inasmuch as it was touted as a "New York Times Bestseller.")  I got to Page 17 of the 658-page book before I gagged.  I managed to read only a few more pages before I set it aside disgustedly.  I quote from the book to explain why:  "Lieutenant Senior Grade Gordon Ramsey had been hit by a fluke rocket that had winged out of its trajectory over the coastline and in on Ramsey's fuselage; the explosion had filled the jet streams" - - (etc).  This almost stopped me in my tracks.  The reason for my hesitancy being the fact that there is no such grade or rank in the US Navy as "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  My inclination is to think that a noted author like Robert Ludlum (or the editor at Bantam Books) should know that while there is, indeed, a rank of "Lieutenant Junior Grade" in the US Navy, there (conversely) is NO such rank as, "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  (The ranks of "Ensign," "Lieutenant Junior Grade" and "Lieutenant" equate to "Second Lieutenant," "First Lieutenant" and "Captain" in all other branches of service except the US Coast Guard which echoes the rank structure of the Navy.  Most confusing, of course, is that the rank of "Captain" in the Navy is equivalent to "Colonel" in the other services. )  I swallowed my disapproval, and continued to read.  But then, the author goes on to tell us that the skipper of the aircraft carrier, a Captain, calls in our protagonist, a Lieutenant Junior Grade, to inform him that he is being promoted to squadron commander after "Lieutenant Senior Grade" Ramsey met his fate with the rocket as previously mentioned.  Here again, I blanched.  A skipper of an aircraft carrier would hardly deal directly with a Lieutenant "Jay Gee" (JG, for "Junior Grade") to inform him of such a thing.  There are, of course, officers of intervening rank and intervening commands and responsibilities below that of the skipper of the ship. You would have other Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders, and Lieutenants who would be in the chain of command between the skipper and the protagonist.  If there's one thing that's paramount in the military, its delegation of authority!  It would certainly be somebody else who would inform the JG of his "promotion."  So, I had to swallow hard, again, and go along with the absurd notion that a Lt. JG would report directly to a Captain, let alone the skipper of the boat.  Then, while these two are conferring, a four-star general shows up unannounced via a tender to chew-out the Navy Captain.  Aw, come on.  Between the four-star and the Captain are three-star generals, two-star generals and one-star generals.  The chain of command would insert these people into the mix well before a four-star would come and deal directly with a four-striper, let alone "chew him out."  After all, one is ARMY, and the other is NAVY.  The ticked-off general would vent his anger through not only his own chain of command, but decidedly through the chain of command of the US Navy.  I swallowed hard, again, but kept reading.  Now, what happens is that the general proceeds to chew-out the captain while the JG is still present in the quarters.  BIG SWALLOW this time.  NEVER in military protocol or in the constraints of military courtesy would a senior officer berate a junior officer in front of somebody who was junior to THAT officer!  It just does NOT happen - - except in B-grade movies that aren't worth the price of admission.  Not only that, but we are now supposed to believe that the JG interrupts the general, and tells him that he's off base for berating the captain.  I almost upchucked!  The captain dismisses the JG, but he refuses to leave (yeah, sure!) and continues to give the general a piece of his mind.  (Yeah sure, again.)  After all, he's a hot-rock fighter pilot, and he's not gonna let some four-star berate the skipper that just promoted him to squadron commander, right?  The general absorbs the static from the JG, but "orders" the Captain to launch a strike despite the unfavorable and deteriorating weather over the target.  He calls the captain "chicken" if he doesn't order the strike, and calls the JG "chicken" if he doesn't fly it.  So, the JG and everybody else fly the mission rather than being labeled as "chicken" despite the previous critical decision regarding unfavorable weather (which, of course, is a ridiculous contention) and the JG gets shot down.  Okay, this is a far as I got in the book.  It's just entirely too hollow and too outlandish in its premise to entice me to read any further.  This sophomoric rhetoric brings this book down to comic-book level.  I can't believe the blurb that says this bookspent time on the best seller list of the New York Times!  But then, I guess that inasmuch as so few of the American public will spend any time in military service these days, this kind of bull-loney can pass for "real world" scenarios and the author can weave such bull-loney into a "believable" plot.  It's a shame.  And, so is this book!  Carl B. Jordan   
 Is it fair to write a review of a book you thought was so stupid and ridiculous you chose not to finish it with only 75 pages to go 
 Cute designs but they shrink.  I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up.  
 I personally believe Dr. Dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart. I really do. However, I think he is misguided and I am not impressed by him. I admit I did not finish the book. Once he began his personal attacks on Mr. Cosby I left it alone.   Bill said what many of us say in private. Period. You can argue that he picked the wrong time and place, but the message is the right one. Maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have, but it is still the truth.   At the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders. Leaders lead, writers write, and speakers talk. The sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders. There are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do. While Dyson beats Cosby down personally I ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation?   There are basically two kinds of people in this world. You either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true. Or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head. At this time our people need the truth, not more pandering.   
 I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera 
 I admit it: I was suckered into buying this book on the strength of Dr. Edwards' classic, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  So how does one repeat the success of a classic?  Well, this book sure isn't it!   OK, there's some helpful advice, particularly for the new art student, but much of the book is worthless.  Her "scientific" opinions seem spurious, like her opinion that we see after-images of colors because the brain has a preference for complements.  She devotes an entire chapter to the worldwide meanings given to colors -- leading the reader exactly nowhere since the meanings are as different as the cultures. I get the sense that this entire chapter was simply book-filler. Finally and ultimately, she fails to answer the question most artists need:  How do I create a working palette?  There are much better books on color theory:  Exploring Color, Color Harmony in Your Paintings, and Blue and Yellow Don't Make Green, to name a few. 
 May be a good source of reference for a beginner in .NET but most of the recipes don't tackle any tough problems. A lot of what is in this book can be easily obtained from free sources such as MSDN online .. 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 When I first picked up "Tomb of the Inflatable Pig", I was blown away. I'd never even thought about Paraguay until I'd read that book and I'll still maintain that it's one of the best travel books I've come accross. So "Theatre of Fish" comes as something of a disappointment.   Put simply, it's very dull. Occasional descriptions of massacres are interesting but generally it show none of the verve or humour of his first one.  Frankly I've only read half way and I'm having trouble trying to finish it.   If you've read his first book then avoid this one like the plague. You'll be shattered. 
 Why is it that when you combine great solo musicians into an all-star lineup the whole is usually less than the sum of its parts? I came to this CD with high hopes featuring as it does four veteran country singers with great reputations.  Despite not being an especially big Mel Tillis fan, I can honestly say that each of the other three have written at least one tune I consider among my favourite songs ever (not just favourite country songs, favourite overall: Waylon Jennings "Lukenbach, Texas". Jerry Reed's "When You're Hot, You're Hot", Bobby Bare's "Detroit City"). I also knew that Shel Silverstein was involved and thought that would be a good thing as he can be a clever writer.  Like one other reviewer here, I'm gonna lay blame at Silverstein's feet. The singers don't sound poor here, but they don't have much in the way of memorable lyrics to sing. The  overdubbed phony crowd noise becomes annoying and the repetitive nature of the subject matter (it's hard to be old) works against desiring frequent listens. One or two novelty numbers like "Cut the Mustard" and "Young Man's Job" would be plenty.  Highlights: "Rough on the Living" casts a jaundiced eye at the country music industry that talked up Johnny Cash after his death but couldn't find space on the airwaves for his new material when he was still with us (even though some of it stood alongside his finest work),"I Don't Do it No More" with Waylon on lead vocal is one of the better 'gettin' older' numbers here ("lovin' them ladies two at a time, I don't do it no more, I CAN'T do it no more..."), "She'd Rather be Homeless" is a pretty witty take on one of country's "four D's" (divorce in this case...the woman chooses poverty over the yuppie life with Bobby Bare..), and "Time" is a wonderfully bittersweet look back at a life well-lived ('So it takes a bit longer to walk up a hill/What of it?/My life now is much more fulfilled/But they're tearin' down buildings that I watched them build')   Low points: Why they chose to use a cliched double entendre like "Old Dogs" as the leadoff track is beyond me. ('Old dogs don't waste his licks but he can still bury a bone'). It's easily one of the worst songs here and made me not want to keep listening to the disc. "Still Gonna Die"'s joke on health nuts wears thin. "Me and Jimmie Rodgers" would be a great piece of Americana if it ever found a hook but it just feels unfinished.   Bottom Line: While I agree that too much of the country music coming out of Nashville these days is faceless and unremarkable, handing substandard material to great singers isn't a good way to make the case for putting the old-timers back on the air. A more convincing case could have been made. Let's hope the Dogs get another chance to leave the doghouse and they get more than table scraps to work with.  2 1/2 star 
 This book is for women who enjoy reading about relationships, in repetitive, excruciating, detail.  Her mother, father, sisters, girlfriends, boyfriends, etc. etc. and her drinking.  Guys will find this hard to keep open 
 We never did figure out how to make them work.  The saddest thing was we gave them as gifts to our nephews boys and they could not use them.  Very dissatisfied with this purchase 
 This must be a joke. Writing yet another book on creativity that is simply a rehash of the original book with a slightly different twist. Not an example of creative thinking in my estimation. Don't waste your money 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 I was very disappointed.  The author's reasonng is fallacious, his research spotty. Could have been written by a high school sophomore.  There are much better works out there 
 This is one of the few books so bad that I couldn't finish it.  There is no explanation of how things work,or in many cases what they really are.  I feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed, sex, or guilt about greed and sex.  Do not bother with this book 
 Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.  
 How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh. 
 I had high expectations of this book, hoping it would be at the minimum insightful to my current views and perspectives. I have to say, this book proves nothing more then stereotpyical concepts in a seemingly unfounded light.  My biggest gripe with the book is not even so much the content, but the way its written is exceedingly difficult to comprehend. Each chapter seems redundant, and at the least self explanitory. The author makes very general points and very little meaning to their comprehension. She states in an earlier chapter how we should have 'figured out what sign we are by now', but I clearly havent. The beginning on how the author sees the garden and comes to these realizations are interesting, but so vague I had trouble placing faith in how these can be compared to modern astrology. The author makes several cliffhangers to end chapters and writes very little information on the "Dark Soul" group which had attracted me to the book in the first place.   The author uses alot of emotion and little sensibility in interpreting the various groups, and after a few chapters, it all sounds the same, redundant and boring. The scenarios the author uses to help understand the soul groups and how we figure them out seems shallow and incomplete, leaving too much to the imagination and too little to guide the reader to self actualization. Even the clarity used to describe certian personality types can be drawn from astrology with greater precision. I found myself wondering why the author avoids certain subjects and does not analyze the more important ones in greater detail.  Overall, I think the book lacks evolution and is flawed in more ways then one. I give this book two stars because I did make me think, at least enough to concider the deep and ancient ways of the Native American spiritualists whom I have sincere respect for. It is a relatively easy read however, if you are not bored by stagnation and dont try to think too much 
 Shallow veneer of "why" overlayed with "my company" and "my software"  Sad.  
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 I was a little disappointed with this item. I was expecting the item being more sturdy, it seems to me that the turntable is not going to last long. It is not a good buy.  
 I purchased this book when my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer last summer (June 2006). I was hoping for some real insight into the process of healing and opening oneself to the channel of healing. I found the book very disappointing. There was nothing in it that inspired my husband in any way nor gave us any insight as to how to investigate the process of opening oneself to the miracle of healing. I was miraculously healed of Multiple Sclerosis in November of 1975 and have conducted many retreats and workshops on "Self Awareness and Healing" across the United States. I had hoped that Adam might have some further insight into the healing phenominan and that I could gain further insight in order to help my husband and others. I read the book aloud to my husband and he,too, was disappointed in the content of the book. I learned nothing new from this book nor found it to be particularly inspirational. My dear husband passed away in October 2006 and received the greatest healing of all, death. He is now in the presence of our Lord and is where I want to be someday 
 I have been buying workout video's/DVD's with Denise Austin for years and have been very happy with them.  However since Denise is no longer with Artisan (she is now with Lions Gate) the quality has changed.  The camera man can't seem to sit still.  When I buy a workout DVD, it's not because I want to look at a pertty face. Far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we, or as in this case our child/ren, need to do.  By the second workout, the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow.  Still, it is not the quality I am used to from Denise.  It could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment 
 I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons: #1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up. #2 There is no option of purchasing a lid #3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot 
 Probably a first of its kind study about families with two-working parents.  However, the writing is poor, redundant and cliched.  The cases she presents don't suggest much variability except income and ethnicity.  Additionally, she skimps on a serious evaluation of what would make a successful household with two working parents and instead leaves us with the overwhelming feeling that success is almost impossible 
 TOTAL waste of time. I got this as a gift and didn't have to waste my own money on it, but only an extraordinarily clueless woman who has never watched television or read a magazine in her life would benefit. The suggestions are ridiculous (seriously, wear a tiara, call your girlfriends, fingerpaint with your feet) and some even borderline offensive. There's a section about being "cosmopolitan" that suggests things you can do to be French, Italian, etc. On the French page, one of the suggestions is to "skip the shower." On the Spanish one, it is "skip the underwear." These women have got to be NUTS.  If anyone ever calls me a diva again, so help me.. 
 This book was sooooo bad, I didn't even finish it.  Thank goodness I read a library copy, as I would have been very perturbed had I paid money for it.  I was hesitent about choosing this book based on the cover blurb.  Two elderly ladies with a valet? In Regency England? How shocking!  But I suspended my disbelief and decided to give it a try.  (I usually like Catherine Coulter's books) I wish I had just trusted my first instincts.  What didn't I like?  The conversations were just simply bizarre. There is absolutely no consideration given to the mores of the time period. (In one scene the "hero" bathes the naked heroine.  In a small country inn. Where the doctor who's been treating her knows she's a girl.  And he's told the entire countryside.  The local squires wife has donated her night gown for the "heroine" to wear.  The vicar has been by to give her last rights.  And yet, the young unmarried "hero" is permitted to nurse a young,naked, unmarried "heroine" who has been impersonating a boy, but everyone knows is a girl.  It is at this point that the book banged against the wall.  I did pick it up again...but I couldn't go more than a chapter beyond before I gave up.  This book was just inane.  Skip it 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 After reading all the great pre-release press, I assumed this book would be full of useful and new ideas.  Wrong.  While the author sounds like someone you'd love to have for a friend and shopping buddy, the book itself  is largely content free 
 Kozol spews his normal emotional stuff but fails to get to the underlying problem: government-provided goods always have at least 2 out of 3 features: they cost a lot, they are low in quality, and they harm the poor. Government education wins the Trifecta: it does all three.  If someone said that lower income people who get food stamps should have to spend their food stamps in government run supermarkets, we would see the idiocy: government has no edge in producing or distributing food. Well, now we have government giving education stamps but saying they have to be spent in government run education stores. Kozol has no right to be shocked. 
 Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair 
 Superficial, biased, gossipy.  All in all, an unworthy book.  For a good read on TR, the 2 volume set by Morris is excellent 
 This being the only book on the subject that was on the bookshelf in the brick&morter store, I was very disappointed in the author's handling of certain key aspects of the subject, that I felt, as a novice were very  important.Specificly alternative sources of suitable supplies and  materials 
 Oh, yes - this is a very fine book... for me to poop on!   In other words, it's a JOKE book. It's just another one of a half dozen duds out there, all trying to slam whoever happens to be the #1 retailer at the time - this decade it's Wal-Mart.   Foreign countries paying their workers less? Blame Wal-Mart! Worker insurance prices going sky high because the medical industry over-estimates it's fees? Blame Wal-Mart! Crooked unions feeling threatened they'll get their butts kicked by non-union competition? Blame Wal-Mart! Etc., etc.  You just have to laugh at how these semi-journalistic schlockmeisters try so desperately to compare themselves to a real activist like Micheal Moore, who actually accomplishes some social good once in awhile.   But you know who's REALLY laughing? That's right - Wal-Mart. That's because they've ALREADY built their thousands of stores, and been in business for over 40 years, so it's way too late now for these mealy-mouthed media wannabes to do anything about it!   And what do these ersatz authors expect at this very late date, anyway? That millions of consumers, during these roller-coaster economic times, will be instantly brainwashed by these new crackpot books and then suddenly start to "boycott lower prices"? Ha! Ha! Ha!   Like I said, this has got to be just another joke book 
 Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible.   It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, "case" would be stretching the definition somewhat 
 Go to Trader Joe's for real natural peanut butter at $1.69 per pound. Yes, you'll need to stir it and that might seem strange at first if you have grown up like we all did on commercial junk. That junk that they add, which always contains heart clogging "partially hydrogenated oils" (read heart clogging) turns the nutritional value of your peanut butter to garbage. You might as just well eat a snickers bar if you're going to eat skippy or peter pan or jiffy or whatever.  Your local health food store may have a peanut butter grinder (and "butter stock" peanuts) which would be uber natural and fresh, doubly delicious AND cheaper.  From THE ADA (American Diabetes Association):  "Are some fats better than others?   Yes. Monounsaturated fats are the healthiest for your body. Nuts -- like almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, and peanuts -- and avocados contain this type of fat. Choose olive or canola oil for cooking. Polyunsaturated fat is the next healthiest fat. This is found in corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and mayonnaise. Use small amounts of foods that contain saturated fats like butter, lard and meat fat, bacon, and shortening. There are lower-fat versions of foods that contain saturated fats, like sour cream and cream cheese. A healthy diet includes less than 30% of calories from fat, with less than 10% of these from saturated fat. 
 [First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned 
 This book started out well, but it is as if the author got VERY distracted about half way through.  I did finish it, though it was painful.  Cheesy.  Bad dialogue!  For true vampire genre fans, give this one a pass.  I have not read the others in this series, so I cannot comment on those.  After reading this one, however, I have no interest in the others 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 I am taking Calc II and am using this book. This book is horrible! I missed a lecture and when I tried doing the homework I got stuck. There are no example like the examples. I am here on this site to buy companion book so that I can do better on my homework. I wish they would stop using this book at university level courses. 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 The story is entertaining enough, but there is not much joy from viewing this DVD. The problem is that the folks producing it apparently were trying to win the contest for the DVD having the world's squattest image. It is EXTREMELY letterboxed WITHIN a 16:9 widescreen format. Even your zoom function won't help you, because the producers moved the subtitles into the black-bar region (and the subtitles are about 2/3 the height of the image itself. The movie becomes simply uninvolving when you see low-resolution images on a thin ribbon across the screen 
 I can see why Christian apologists like this book. It is well written, with lots of sensible advice in arguing wtih skeptics, and it was written from the heart.  But the idea that some minimal agreed on set of facts makes the resurrection of Jesus the best explanation of history is just - bunk. In fact, it is pseudo-history, the way creationism is pseudo-science. It requires one to uncritically accept the historical value of the New Testament, and ignore all modern historical standards for evidence.  I have heard WIlliam Lane Craig lay out this pseudo-history in a debate, and also Greg Licona. Craig is a very accomplished debater, Licona less so - but neither one is persuasive. The idea that there is credible historical evidence for an empty tomb is just false, and the whole argument falls to pieces after that.  I think that the point of this book is to make Christians feel better about their intellectual credentials. But the arguments do not convince anyone who knows about historical standards of evidence. And if Christian missionaries just keep repeating these arguments, it will eventually make them look bad.  I would recommend any book by Robert Price, especially the Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, to anyone who really wants to evaluate the historical case for the Resurrection 
 Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.  Maybe the next book could be an new history based on  archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I first  read J. Gilbert many years ago: many people, it seems, jump on the bandwagon whey they find a poet who doesn't publish often or publish a lot of poems. Mr. Gilbert has admirable feelings, but he is unable to translate them into readable, cogent, successful poems. He is not better nor worse than many poets who are acclaimed (wrongfully, for the most part) and regularly published: e.g. Jorie Graham; Louise Gluck; May Oliver; Maxine Kumin; Charles Simic, Gary Snyder etc. ad infinitum, ad nauseam.   The major problem respecting poetry in America today is that we have too many writers and too few readers (I know, some good poets can't get published--true, but far fewer poets than most people realize). Mr. Gilber subtracts time from the reading of other poets, including especially the classics: Virgil, Dante, Donne, Herbert, Pope, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Yeats, Pound and Eliot, to name well-known poets. Among more recent poets, those readers who effuse over Gilbert and many other current poets, should be reading Elizabeth Bishop; Edgar Bowers; Geoffrey Hill (often difficult, but absolutely the best poet of our time and certain to be studied in years to come); Basil Bunting; Charles Tomlinson (a must!!!); John Berryman (Dream Songs); J.V. Cunningham.    That said I have read volumes and volumes of poetry published in the last 25 years. Good poets are there for the reading: Betty Adcock; Dick Barnes; Dick Davis; Ellen Bryant Voigt; Gibbons Ruark; Cathy Smith Bowers; David Mason; Bin Ramke; Andrea Hollander Budy; Kathryn Stripling Byer; Fred Chappell; Kelly Cherry. Not a lot more.  The bad inevitably crowds out almost all the good, particularly when many readers are still trying to emulate Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton or the odious John Ashberry; or they just use modern lingo indiscriminately or they write about politics, feminism ad infinitum, ad nauseam. Or they write what they read and hear in Creative Writing classes and workshops that ubiquitously litter our land with slop and slag.   Avoid Mr. Gilbert: read good poetry (And if you can't stand to be told what to read: listen to Mahler, Mozart, Bach). You could also do a lot worse than read Shakespeare or Cormac McCarthy. 
 Although the "technical data" said this pot is safe for the stovetop, when it arrived, its own literature said very clearly that it is NOT safe for stovetop use. The only reason I ordered it was because I wanted something I could move from stovetop to oven or broiler. THis is very disappointing 
 I had originally seen this book as a subject of PBS' Frontline several months ago. I was enthralled by the subject matter and decided to get a copy from the local library and read about it myself. What a mistake. The PBS Frontline TV program was so much better than the book. I found Maraniss'  switch from the Viet Nam story to the University of Wisconsin protest story very aggravating; and, as another reader mention, it made for a very disjointed narrative. The juxtapositioning of the two narratives does not work!  I found myself more interested in the war portion of the book than reading about Soglin and his friends embroiled in a protest against Dow Chemical. Frankly, I found this portion of the book to be quite a bore and it almost ruined the book for me. Who cares about college kids and their protesting episodes. It is simply not important.   If you are interested in reading the book, read the Nam portion and skip the protest chapters. Better yet, catch the Frontline episode and skip the book completely. 
 I thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great.  I would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product.  Also I loved the pink.  When I opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off.  I tried to snap them into place but they would not stay.  For the amount of money I payed i expected a much better product.  Needless to say i returned it the next day. 
 What a travesty. What a big travesty. They did not condense this book--they gutted it of all its wit and humor. Buy the original "Go, Dog. Go! 
 I was unfortunately subjected to the second edition of this book during my graduate studies at DTU. In my opinion there's only one good thing to say about this book, and that is that it's the only book I've seen where you get a comprehensive introduction to all of the techniques for developing and serving web-pages. Unfortunately, the authors are living in a Miocrosoft Internet Explorer only world, which especially is reflected in their chapters on (x)html and javascript. Problem is, no version of IE is actually capable of understanding xhtml, so what you are in fact taught is xhtml 1.0 served as text/html which is treated as hmtl 4.01 in all browsers. Even worse, the third edition has rewritten all the examples in xhmtl 1.1 which *should*not* be served as text/html. Even worse, the xhtml examples given will trigger an error in IE 6 that will get IE 6 to behave as IE 5.5 in quirks mode - inclusive the css box model error. As to the javascript examples, the book isn't teaching you the w3c DOM but only the IE DOM, thus all examples using eg document.all will possibly fail in some browsers. And document.write isn't allowed if you are serving your pages as application/xhmtl+xml. I'm considering this book dangerous because it doesn't teach you how to code according to the w3c standards but only according to the 'Microsoft standard 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking & the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far. 
 This book was advertised as NEW but when it arrived, it had several pages missing and numerous paragraphs clipped out of other pages.  NOT GOOD 
 If you are expecting tons of pictures of different brochure design, you will love this book. I was expecting a "how to" book brochure design 
 a very nice size - easy to keep in one's pocket however the illustrations of EKG strips were tiny, poorly printed, and of little use to anyone except a very experienced reader.  On the whole, it was a disapointment as the text itself did not provide basic information on most dysrythmias, forcing the reader to go back to a more detailed textbook. I would not order it 
 This book began by raising some very interesting questions about "mother love" versus "father love", that is, about the need for a person to experience both unconditional love and earned love. I eagerly bought the book, logically believing these provocative questions would be answered at the end of the book, but IMHO Kushner wimps out. He writes that there really isn't any difference at all, despite the fact that he outlined significant differences earlier in the book.  I won't be buying Kushner's latest book, which was released earlier this month (although I'll probably read parts of it in a bookstore). I find myself growing a bit tired of his technique of profiling one Old Testament character per book. (He's profiled Job, the writer of Ecclesiastes/King Solomon, Jacob/Israel in this book, and Moses in his latest.) Kushner writes really well, and I'd like to see him break out of this mold and deliver some truly original ideas 
 Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.  My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.  The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes:  "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand."  One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it.  Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.  Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.  Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 If you want a book that has interesting spiritual quotes, but doesn't take a specific stand on any of them...this is your book; it's really more of a "spiritual quote book" edited by a politically correct quorom of authors.  It struck me that it was almost like I was sitting next to a hippie who has deeply studied religions, but thanks to all the pot they've smoked, can't really decipher what the point of the quotes was in the first place, and who lives his life by none of them.  Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of great quotes; however, if you have any inkling at all of what kind of spirituality you'd like to explore, you're better getting a more specific book.  This book hits in such a broad way as to make it's chapters somewhat irrelevant in the final analysis.  I understand that their goal is to cover what every major philosophical/religious idea is, but it seems kind of silly to have "modern humanist perspectives" next to Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, and Confucianist statements.  It's basically a poorly designed text book that was written without analytical analysis.  I guess that a lot of the book strikes me as more of a "nobody's right" approach to spiritualism that is dangerously close to moral relativism.  My feeling is that if you want to study what the great teachers, philosophers, and religious icons think, you're better off studying them specifically, as this book tries to please everyone, and likely pleases very few 
 This book could have been one of Coupland's best, however, the ending is so horrendous that you honestly feel the writer is mocking you for having read it in the first place. A thoroughly disappointing novel 
 I recently purchased this book on Amazon and dug in. The technology does not get in the way of the message and the author has a light humor which makes the learing process go faster. Incidentally, I had a question so I left an email for the author, and got a personal response the next day, clearing up my question. I recomend this book and other titles written by this person 
 I am currently in an ethics class and this book was required for the course. This is by far the most repetitive and useless book you will ever use in your entire life. NO JOKE. It offers no insight into things that you dont already know. It simply takes what you already know, puts it into fancier words, and spits it right back at you. If this book is not a requirement for a class then dont waste your money. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go throw this peice of crap in a volcano and forget I was ever plagued by its stupidity and uselessness 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.   The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)  This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinio 
 Child molester Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Bueller's principal) does the worst performance of his career. Full of lame gags and dumb dialog, Shawny Smith, Barry Corbin, Tim Thomerson and Candy come off best in here. Good disguises though... Candy as jockey - Yikes! The poor horses! Even worse on them in Wagons East (*.5) 
 The author should be sued for deception.  The biggest blunder I've ever made was buying this book 
 Ugh, where to begin?  As others have written before me, there are so many basic errors in this book that I wonder at the author's "research."  If he had spent more time getting the facts straight instead of pretending to know what Gene Kelly was thinking during the AFI tribute, then this book may not be the shambles we readers have had to endure.  As I was reading, finding the errors actually became a game for me.  I would sit there with my book and pen and paper, just daring Yudkoff to pitch out another mistake.  Here are the ones I found:  (I'm sure there are several others.)  1.  Shirley Maclaine's dress at the AFI Tribute is BLACK not RED.  An error that is SO basic, it shows how careless this author is throughout the entire book.  2.  In For Me and My Gal, Judy Garland's character was NOT engaged to the George Murphy character.  Hey Yudkoff, it would help if you saw the movies of the person about whom you're writing, don't you think???  3.  Again, in For Me and My Gal, the Judy Garland and Gene Kelly characters are NOT "immediate sensations," as the author states.  Sheesh.  4.  Yup, another one regarding For Me and My Gal:  the "author" (I'm beginning to use this term more loosely) states that Gene Kelly's character is a solo act in Europe.  NOT TRUE.  Watch the movie you careless dolt!  5.  In Living in a Big Way, Yudkoff says that there is a dance with a trained dog and a dance with a statue.  AHEM!  They are the same dance.  Yikes, this is getting embarrassing!  I'm glad I'm not this author!  6.  Here's one of the worst:  When Yudkoff refers to Vera-Ellen's character in On the Town as "MISS SUBWAYS!"  Oh my gosh.  Her title was "Miss Turnstiles."  Hmm..sounds like someone really needs to sit down with some of the movies before writing any more books.    7.  Now here's something I've never seen before in any book, using the exact same quote TWICE.  On page 197 and on page 202 he uses the same GK quote in referring to the pioneering on-location film technique of On the Town.  (Of course, by this time, who knows if those are even real quotes?  So much has already been fabricated!)  SHAME ON THE AUTHOR, THE EDITOR, and THE PUBLISHER who bought the book!!!  Gene Kelly fans have waited for 20 years for an updated biography of this legendary dancer, choreographer, and director.  The readers deserve better and so does Mr. Kelly himself.    Other annoying things are the way the author's internal monologue Gene Kelly is having with himself at the AFI Tribute(which I gave up on and stopped reading) basically just criticizes and insults everyone.  And don't even get me started on the way he keeps hinting at homosexual rumors and portrays a young Betsy Blair as this side of a nymphomaniac. Plus, the book only focuses on about half of Gene Kelly's life.  Twenty years are sideswiped in a couple of paragraphs and 40-some years are glossed over in a few pages.  How about giving Gene Kelly some credit for being a single widowed father who raised his two younger children who lost their mother to cancer at ages 8 and 11?  How about informing your readers that this generous father turned down numerous projects so that he could provide a stable home for his children and this was when he was in his 60's? All Yudkoff cares about are the glamour days.  Not a nice way to treat your subject, who you claim to admire.   If you're as frustrated as I am, do what the author did, just learn what you can about Gene Kelly from the 1974 book written by Clive Hirschhorn.  You get several treats in one:  ACTUAL quotes from Gene Kelly and those who knew him, ACTUAL facts about the man, and a thoroughly enjoyable read.  As for this book:  IT IS A DISGRACE!  The entire thing is written like the author is wearing a neon sign saying, "Hey everyone!  Look at me!  I'm writing a book about Gene Kelly!"  OK!  So you wrote your terrible book, now do something useful like apologize to your readers.  If I was Betsy Blair, or Kerry, Timothy, or Bridget Kelly, I would sue the pants off this guy.  Ugh, ugh, and again I say, UGH 
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye. having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film. do not watch this film. it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of. the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!! 
 Packer is considered by many to be an excellent scholar, and with that said, about half of his chapters are well thought out, and quite good for the one or two pages he gives them. However, the problem starts in that the rest are steeped in Reformed traditions, and not necessarily, the plain revealed Word in Scripture. He relies too heavily on Augustine and Calvin instead of trying to work things out on his own. He sticks with the System. In many of his chapters, he comes across as arrogant and offensive to anyone who doesn't hold to his particular flavor of Reformed theology. He intentionally uses extreme and elitist labels to belittle other viewpoints. Packer, as with many of the High Calvinists, doesn't hesitate to put dissenters into any extreme category. In this book, Packer doesn't have to worry about being accused of being humble or irenic.   As a High Calvinist, he also continues the tradition of emphasizing the work of Law over Grace in sanctification. His other chapters are highly seasoned with Law as well. He has 3 chapters that emphasize Law and not one on Grace! Someone should give him a copy of Romans and Galatians. In addition, Packer doesn't hesitate to use only those verses which seem to support his position. The rest are ignored. If you buy into the dogmatic System of logic and Reformed traditions, over the plain Word of God, then this is the book for you. For the rest, please look elsewhere, or at least read it with an open study Bible that lists the verses that don't agree with him.  
 I personally think this book (actually having read it impartially) is not good for any Information Security professional, corporate or government (IA, IAM, IASO, ISSO, ect), but, if you had to place it in any category I guess it would be in the business management end of communication compliance (maybe for a Policy Compliance Officer).  Also I really think that some of the other reviewers here must have been working to promote this book.  I unfortunately say this because the author creates entirely too many unique and extremely complex management policy theories on communication development, which frankly gets way off the subject of INFOSEC, and even has him chasing his own tail in the narrated scenarios.  The author even goes so far as to concoct and create possibly 20-30 new acronyms (as if you didn't have enough already as a real INFOSEC professional), which almost became a little comedic by the end of the book, especially when hearing even the author try recap each chapter and make each new theory tie into another new theory.  Although I'm sure the author is a very distinguished professional in his own right, I unfortunately found this book weak to incorporate into any of my perceived Information Security plans.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one and move onto the next, and make sure the books you choose on this topic do not try to reinvent the wheel 
 i cannot get thru this one.  i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear to have any good spots.  when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this, i thought, this has to be good.  i had just finished a movie where he starred.  can't remember the name of it.  i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it.  tori spelling is well known, but not to me.  someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start.  she does not play a flake very well, and i don't know what to call her except a flake.  i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot, but with tori spelling as one of the leads, i already know this one does not have a prayer.  i would say; save your money on this one unless you are under 13.  i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that don't.  this one falls into this category. one that came with this one was "the broken hearts club" and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage.   
 I wanted to read Ms. Kaminer's book with an open mind, which is exactly how I started after picking it up from my local library.  However, in her introductory comments she refers to an author as "Beverly DeAngelis."    It's Barbara DeAngelis, by the way, and she has a PhD.    If Ms. Kaminer can't be bothered to fact-check her work, then I really shouldn't be bothered reading it.  
 I've never seen Lawrence of Arabia nor heard the music from it, but I know what middle eastern music sounds like.  Troy is supposed to be a--fractured, completely inaccurate--movie about the ancient GREEK battle of Troy.  The music sounds more fit for a Lawrence of Arabia re-make starring Will Ferrell or Matthew Broderick or something.  The battle music is flaccid, the general sound is pure 100% middle eastern, despite the fact that the ancient city of Troy is NOWHERE NEAR the middle east (actually, it was quite close, that's an exaggeration, but culturally it was nowhere near the middle east) and bears no resemblence to anything Greek sounding like in "Alexander" 2004 or "Alexander the Great" 1954 or "The Odyssey" 1997 TV movie.  Aside from the movie being absolutely awful, the music follows suit, along with a stupid pop-song sung by some Seal-sounding pop star about love or something against the middle eastern main theme, when the movie's love scenes are clearly empty and flaccid, and the movie ceases to be about love about 30 minutes in 
 Don't buy this book, unless you have a copy machines that enlarges in your home. Very disappointed. Will never buy a book from That Patchwork Place again 
 The original film 8 MM deals with the theme of why people commit horrendous acts of violence, as it deals with an 8MM film that contains a real murder.  These films have been dubbed snuff films.  Director Alejandro Amenábar even makes a better story of his terrific thriller called Thesis (1996) that portrays a female college student studying violence in media who also comes across a snuff film.  Thus, when a title comes out with the name 8MM 2, the audience will make the logical deduction that it will also deal with a theme of why people commit vile murderous acts on film.  In addition, to set the film in east Europe enhances this notion of brutal violence, as many films and news updates contain dreadful crimes in Eastern Europe that have links with organized crime.  Thus, the implications of another tense and suspenseful cinematic event is set to bring viewers down the horror lane.  However, it would be complete miscalculation by the audience to make the inference that the sequel would follow the same theme.  Here in 8MM 2, which does not even have any of the same actors, director, or theme, merely applies the title of a successful film in order to attract viewers.  The film tries to evoke a similar atmosphere of depravity and immorality among the upper class, as Joel Schumacher's 8MM.  It succeeds to some extent, but does not have the same grim and dark touch.  8MM 2 opens with a shot of a courtroom where a number of people are talking while the sound of a passionately active couple sexually pleasure one another.  Here the story advertises the film's path, as David (Johnathon Schaech) tells his fiancé, Tish (Lori Heuring), about a sexual fantasy of his.  They are on their way to a weekend vacation at a luxurious hotel where they intend to bathe each other in sinful lust, which enhances when Tish invites a woman to join them after a nightclub visit.  Together they end up in a ménage à trios that they never are going to forget.  After the return from their wicked vacation, there are obviously some tense emotions underneath the surface.  It bears the same sentiments that Threesome (1994) portrayed through three sexually experimenting college students.  However, the emotional turmoil quickly evaporates when David receives an envelop with pictures of Tish, David, and the girl that they met in the club.  Due to Tish's father's political position as an ambassador in Hungary and a potential candidate for the Supreme Court nominee and David's future in politics they cannot approach law enforcement.  It leaves them dealing with the criminals themselves, which brings them on a journey into the Budapest red light district and the world of pornography.  The film provides a futile attempt to make it a political thriller, but this too fails.  Instead, it provides an erotic thriller with non-existent suspense, but much erotica. In some aspects, the film will remind the audience about Wild Things (1998), but there is far more sexuality present in 8MM 2.  The film tries to hide a poor story underneath the world of sex while dealing with a rather amusingly silly extortion affair.  In addition, Tish and David also seem completely oblivious in regards to the threats that the underworld could pose on them if the criminal elements so desired.  The many awkward moments within the film outweigh everything else, and leave the viewers with a hollow and empty cinematic experience.  8MM 2 was a rather disappointing film, as it had nothing to do with the original film with Nicolas Cage, and the story was a clichéd combination between Wild Things and an adult film.  The question is whether the audience is better of with the latter, as the story does not capture the audience's attention in regards to suspense, or drama 
 Since I got RSI myself, I've read a number of books on the subject, and of all I've read, this book was at the bottom of the barrel. I'm not saying it is completely without merits, but most of the good advice are available in  all other books I've read. I do, however, fail to see advice about  meditation and guided imagery as relevant to RSI 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Recordings sound like they were all done the same day, in as little time as possible, with the least amount of studio talent.  Terrible 
 I love how everyone assumes that when they write a review they just HAVE to give it 5 stars...  I mean, I'm just trying to figure out if I'm the only one who actually read the book.  I'm not sure.  What I AM sure of is that if you're someone looking to find out what karma is all about from an eastern perspective, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  This book is like Billy Graham trying to get all new-age on us.  Believe me,I'm the first person to jump up and tell everyone I know when a book is good...  And uh, well...I'm just kinda sitting here right now 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I enjoy the initial season of Murder She Wrote very much.  My wife and I are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to Who Dun IT.  Frequently, though, it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up.  Often the audio gets out of synch with the video.  Terrible!  We surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons, but now -- about 3/4 the way through, I think we'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided DVD's 
 DO NOT BUY THIS TV, I BOUGHT IT IN FEBRUARY AND IT HAS A LOT OF BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ALL OVER THE SCREEN THIS IS TERRIBLE, I CALLED SONY THEY HAD TECHNICIANS COME OVER TO MY HOUSE THEY SAY THIS IS NORMAL, THEY REFUSE TO FIX OR REPLACE THE TV AFTER I SPENT $2,500 ON THIS SET IM SO DISSAPOINTED AND FEEL ROBBED! 
 This book is sure to please right-wingers who like to denigrate liberals as "elitist'. It does a good job of pointing out (old) issues in which the left did not succeed in all of the goals of liberal programs, without a hint that the things the right-wing was trying did not work either. In Sowells' view, everything was hunky-dory in the 50s, and if only the liberals would have left things alone, poverty would have been eliminated, cars would naturally have become safer, and the God "free-market" would have worked his magic to cure societal ills such as out-of-wedlock births, the plight of black americans, and the AIDS epidemic.   Interestingly, Sowell uses the word 'anointed' a biblical term favored by evangelicals and the current neo-cons in power as they pander to the religious right, to describe a type of liberal he doesn't like. His disregard for the Left ruins any chance that anyone except a right-wing ditto-head will enjoy this book.   Sowell denigrates the Left's use of statistics, just prior to using the same statistics to "prove" his points. "Aha"!   Ignoring the last 12 years or so, Sowell asserts that it is the Left who try to tell people what to do, and use the government to rule people.  Right. And Fox news is fair and balanced.   If you are a right-winger, you will enjoy reading his preaching to the choir of how bad liberals are, and the revelation that their motives (help the poor; seek justice for all Americans; provide for a healthy life...) are really a justification to tell "the benighted" what to do.  If you are a thinking person, you will be mostly  satisfied by everything except Sowell's utter disregard for those who don't agree with him.  For those seeking a balanced look at our societies' problems, how we can solve them, and how we came to be in the current mess, you will have to look elsewhere. Sowell's disdain permeates the book and makes his assumptions (based on the same type of thinking he hates in the Left) not worth trusting.  In short, another attack-book, albeit this time from someone with a brain. 
 As a Vodou Houngan I read this book with expectations of it being the usual banter with only a marginal amount of information.  What I found was something else entirely.  A book that has false information in it and manages to have an author against Vodou.  Calling it "hysterical nonsense" I believe was the term used.  The author stated this near the end of the book.  Please!...  Unless you know A LOT about Vodou don't read this book.  The Tao of Physics or Divine Horsemen are MUCH better alternatives 
 This book appears to be a collaberation between Andre Norton and Grace Hogarth, but it reads very unlike Ms. Norton's style.  I was very disappointed in this book and had to stop reading it after only three chapters.  The plot was very predictable, the characters are not very believable.  I have to think Ms. Norton only glanced at what Ms. Hogarth was writing, and did not contribute to this book either in plotlines or in characterizations.  Don't waste your money 
 Worst book I've read all year (this is being written in late November) and strong contender for worst book of the decade.  Flat, leaden, dull prose.  Cardboard characters with no depth.  Silly little trivial asides.  No sense whatever of plotting, timing or narrative.  The author uses a true story from the pages of the Wall Street Journal as the basis for this book, but does not realize that he still has an obligation to write well and make the characters come alive -- you can't hang your words on an extoskeleton; the book has to have internal structure.  The ending is farcial, and the subplot conflict between father and son is a genuine embarassment to read.  Avoid at all costs.  I want my money back! 
 A very bizarre, artsy Swedish film. It is more visually driven than plot driven. I could not make it past the 30 minute mark. I gather that the point has something to do with things in life being confusing and a sense of dissatisfaction with the way life goes, a lack of connections with things that are important, for example. It could technically be interpreted to mean many things to many different people, which is the one really beautiful thing about this loosely organized film. 
 The book's objective: "An exploration of core diagrams, and how they can be used effectively in business".  What the book tells you: Fourteen core diagrams, what they are, how to use them. They are all familiar diagrams that an average user will find it easy to understand. Most, if not all, of the diagrams are standard textbook presentations. I see nothing new from this book.  What the book does not tell you: Non-core diagrams. I bought this book expected to discover some fancy diagrams to use in my business presentations. The kinds that consultants are found of using to justify their horrendous fees. But none of that is present in this book.  
 The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up 
 MY WGX102 BEGAN TO FAIL ROUGHLY AROUND THE END OF THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY.  WHEN IT DID FINALLY FAIL DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS 33 DAYS AFTER THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, NETGEAR WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT IN ANY WAY.  UNLESS YOU'RE INTO BUYING $100 DISPOSABLE NETWORKING GEAR, AVOID THIS PRODUCT 
 The book we received was not the full book with the ISBN number we ordered. It was volume one of two with a different ISBN number, which was clearly noted on the back of the book. We had to send the book back AT OUR EXPENSE 
 As the teachings of Buddhism cross the pacific ocean, it is very difficult to know what is true and what is false. this is false teachings. We here in the United States think that we live in  a world that there are many choices and that we can pick and choose.  Our deluded thinking that we have  the ability to choose what is best is absolutely wrong.   this book steals from Vajrayana Buddhism but is aligned with Bonpo. All buddhist and those that are trying to learn about Vajrayana Buddhism, just do not buy. Look to the sacred text of true Vajrayana teachers such as Padmasambava, Patrul Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Thinley Norbu.   In Tibet, only those that are regarded a true teachers have the right to teach and be a guide. Beware of those that come with nice sounding words but have not wisdom.   You want to follow Bonpo, then buy this book as well as those from Namkai Norbu. But for the rest, those that seek full awakening through the path of Vajrayana buddhism, this book will only lead you astray 
 I graduated in Statistics, and so I know boring books.  And, this book was more boring than any of my Statistics texts.  It is written in textbook format.  It is also written by a bunch of different authors, so it's really disjointed.  As an example, the chapter guest written by an attorney in boring legalese is probably the most interesting.  And, they misspelled McDonalds.  In a book about FRANCHISES!  I could understand if they misspelled Wal-Mart in a book about franchises, but how can you write a book about franchises and misspell McDonalds?  See the misspelling on pages 86 and 196.  Also, it is written to franchisors, not franchisees.  Since the marketing of the book makes it look like it's trying to appeal to everyone, it took me a few chapters to figure out that it's actually written to franchisors.  Repeat: It is NOT good for franchisees.  I did complete the entire book.  I'm not one of those reviewers who calls the book boring after reading a few pages and throwing it away.  I am someone who plugged through so that I could warn everyone else 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 No other entity spread anti-black racism more than the slave industry and Hollywood, and both were and are Jewish run. This claim that Jews put on a black face to work against anti-Jewish sentiment has to be the farthest stretch of Jews justifying their own racism towards blacks that I've read so far, and I've read more than my share. We need to be spending more time on combatting real racism, not a fabricated kind 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 In most of erotic movies I use the fast forward between the sex parts. but in this movie they did it I have to fast forward through the sex parts. so the sex parts are too slow not well cast. the best thing is the cover of the DVD.   
 Ok, i started bass and i got this book, it is not worth buying! under any circumstances!  it walks you though laim exercises, and has about 5 pages on the same scale (major) just in different keys! this is a very very poor book 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand. If he's so correct in this, why didn't he ever submit his work to the scientific journals (where REAL science is done afterall)? He must be afraid of honest criticsim, that's why you publish to those who already agree with you, it's called preaching to the choir.   oh wait, it's probably because of the conspiracy...yeah that's it 
 This book is not for programmer who needs more exlanation They tried to explain everything in shot...  
 I was disappointed with Dr Moody's work in this book. I found that he was departing from his usual scientific approach and perspective to something more like a sci-fi description of events that may have been nothing at all to begin with. For readers interested in the topic, I would instead recommend Hello from Heaven 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 I enjoyed the movie even though I was only able to watch it in segments. The first time I tried to watch it, after about 20 minutes, the screen went to digital gibberish and my DVD player hung up so that I couldn't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power. I had to unplug the DVD player, wait, and replug the power cord to remove the disc. Overnight, I decided I needed to replace my DVD player. However, the next morning, I tried a different DVD and it worked fine. It still works fine on all my other DVDs. I complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of Showgirls. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. It plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my DVD player. I gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without Showgirls. I use my DVD player almost every day and it works fine except when I try to watch Showgirls 
 I would much rather be considered nice and earn my way through this world the way I am.  Being myself in the business arena has worked well for me thus far, and I don't care if the trend is to deviate from feminity.  I think we should respect everyone, and not propegate the evolution of a sexless society.  All in all, I would much rather be a nice person and have people like me than be a b%tch with a nice office.  People remember you by how you made them feel, not by how much money or power you had 
 Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is "What's Up". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails "Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved "No Rain", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't 
 I read in a magazine about how "wonderful" and full of "romance" this novel was and so I checked it out for a bit of summer reading only to discover that it wasn't wonderful or romantic at all.  The narration was witty and comical, but the outcome of the novel was frustrating and sad. As anyone will tell you, a young man named Charles is walking along the beach one day with his fiancee when they come across a forlorn young woman staring out at the sea. The rumors say that this young woman (Sarah) had her heart broken by a French L. who then left her for the sea, and that everyday she stares at the ocean in the hope that he will come back. She is dismissed as mad by the locals and works for a snobby old Catholic woman.  And yet, dispite all this, Charles is smitten by her.  He and the French L.'s woman cross pathes regulary by chance, until Charles finally sits down with her and asks her for her story: it only confirms what everyone else is saying: she slept with the French L. and he left her heartbroken.  ::SPOILERS:: Don't buy this novel. I can tell you what happens and save you ten bucks.   What happens next is this: Sarah is fired on the mere suspicion that she is having a tryst with said Charles. Sarah fires up (for the first time showing a temper) and declares that she is NOT fired -- she quits! She then storms from the hosue and disappears from the town alltogether. The  town goes on a manhunt for her -- but, of course, it's Charles who finds her.  Later, the two hook up in a hotel and have sex. When Charles's family and future father-in-law find out, he is stripped of his inheiritance, left poor and thoroughly humiliated, while Sarah has disappeared yet again . . . and yet he STILL  can not forget her! He travels the world, missing Sarah, until one say he locates her. She's been living with an artist.  Here are the alternate endings:  Ending one: Sarah and Charles meet, Charles is naturally upset, but all anger is forgotten when a little girl appears. It is his daughter. He stays and holds the child. End of story.  Ending two: Sarah and Charles meet, Charles is pissed off and yells at Sarah, who is trying to tell him that he's a father. Charles won't listen. He storms from the house and never gets to meet his daughter. End of story.  What a great story, huh? (Sarcasm) 
 This short E.P. of mostly live performances was mainly an effort to hold fans over in-between albums.  Some live performances with Queen were included, including a powerful hit rendition of the Freddie Mercury classic "Somebody To Love" (#30 US) and a lovely cover of Queen's "These are the Days of Our Lives," performed as a duet with Lisa Stansfield.  Michael also performs live renditions of Seal's "Killer"(#69 US), which segues into the Rolling Stones' "Papa Was a Rolling Stone," and a stark, stirring performance of Bob Telson's Oscar nominated "Calling You" (from the BAGDAD CAFE).  Also included, for somewhat inexplicable reasons, is a brief snippet of Queen performing "Dear Friends" from it's SHEER HEART ATTACK album.  There are enough interesting moments to make this a fine listen for Michael's fans, however, none of the covers top the originals and most listeners will be able to live without it. 
 I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper, which is why I bought it.  I see now that the description has been corrected, but too late for me.  also, the sizing does not run true as the current description states.  I usually wear 9.5, but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes 
 For an adult beginner, this book is of very limited value. It cannot be used to learn the piano, but is only a general guide for someone who already has a substantial musical background. I would not buy this book if  you are an absolute beginner other than to read a sometimes interesting  story about how a more advanced player practices and learns to play the  pian 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 This movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of Christian Bale and Colin Farrell to date.  It was boring, overblown and incessantly long.  It's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better, but it never does - and then it just ends.  Don't waste the time or the money 
 I've been following the Alex Cross series from its beginning, and after reading Cat & Mouse, I'm wondering if Patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go... Given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more Cross books written subsequently to this one, I can only hope that the series gets better.  My complains are similar to those of other reviewers:  1. I'm getting sick of the perfection of Alex Cross.  The man's a saintly father, saintly grandson, saintly lover, saintly charity worker, and saintly detective.  These traits hooked the reader and made Cross an intriguing character, but he's fast becoming too one-dimensional.  2. The Cross/Sampson relationship.  As if we weren't sick enough of this already.  Every few chapters, we're reminded of the man-crush Cross and Sampson have on each other.  Sampson is so perfect in Cross's eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time Sampson enters a scene.  3. The Cross/Christine Johnson relationship moves WAY too fast.  One moment Christine is still mourning the loss of her husband (who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in Jack & Jill) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date, and the next she and Cross are madly in love.  No development whatsoever, no line from Point A to Point B.  4. I'm not sure Patterson could have written the dialogue between Cross and his children any more unrealistically.  Aren't these 7- and 9-year-old children?  He has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with Sampson or Kyle Craig.  5. The entire novel is a series of pseudo-climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field.  The Soneji resolution was anti-climactic at best, and the Mr. Smith conclusion was unfulfilling 
 Despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie, this is really pretty sick stuff, with little or no redeeming social context.  Objectively, sick just isn't erotic, no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so.  Those who think differently really ought to either:  (a) focus a little more; (b) examine their true motives; or (c) get a life 
 The product is fine. But the description is misleading. Each package contains "40 count," that is, 40 filters. But this is not a "(Pack of 12)," as you would think from the description, from the price reduction (from $23.88 to $1.93), and from the shipping weight (4.20 lbs). It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.  Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive 
 I bought this over the top "chick flick" for my wife and 13 year old daughter.  I stay out of the room when they need a fix 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 This box set was a horrible rip-off.  I love the show and this season has some great episodes, but I couldn't watch them all because the DVD keeps skipping and sometimes becomes just plain unreadable.  I have a Playstation 2 which can read practically any type of digital disc known to man without problems, but it can't read this.  It's not just one disc, either.  All of the discs had problems.  I believe that this is a result of the two-sided disc, because try as I might, I couldn't find a single scratch on any of the discs and after I cleaned them thoroughly, they continued to skip in the same exact places.  I intend on writing Universal to try to get a replacement copy, but in the meantime, I am very disappointed with the quality of this box set 
 Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before.  The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career.  He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages.  This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book.  It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant 
 We  hastily bought this book for a friend and just as quickly returned it after taking a look at it's content. If you're still on the carnivor boat and wish to expose your child to the high dioxin and chemical load found in meat, then this book's for you. If you're a bit more informed and concerned about the contamination of meat, then look elsewhere for alternative nutrition and recipe info. As a pharmacist, let me tell you that children are exceptionally sensitive to the chemical contamination that is in U.S. produced meat. This ain't the good ol' days and meat has changed. Be very careful where your animal products come from or consider eliminating them altogether 
 Why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries  and cheese. This new version, with it's claims of a "lighter  nuttier" taste, is plain awfu 
 This book reminded me of some of the better novellas written by my high school creative writing students over my 27 years of teaching.  Characterization remains shallow, and description is often extraneous.  The present tense narration doesn't work well for the story, as the action is described in a detached fashion, for the most part.  Considering what she experiences, Kat is one cool female--too cool for me to believe in.      Awkward sentences and occasional grammar lapses were disengaging, as well.    I'm afraid I can't fathom any comparison to Crichton and other well-known writers here--other than the plot.  It's a good plot.  Politics, medicine, war, romance, murders, your typical best-seller plot elements are all here.  The book is in need of major editing and revision, though, if it is to catapult the author to the level of other bestselling thriller writers.      
 The Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres. Bush's policies on marriage. However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a "private" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative.   Mr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing "I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it." She also states she was "aware vaguely" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000. Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children?   I wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book 
 This book is well written in many ways, but it is a literary mess. I kept waiting for the story to chose a direction and stick with it, but it never does. Rather, it goes in four or five different directions. The language is overly course, even for someone like myself who has uttered a few choice phrases in his life. It reminded me of several books that I read as an undergraduate in college, the likes of which that a professor or TA would go crazy over-analyizing, pointing out every possible metaphor, analogy, etc. This is not to say that the book is horrible. It does have moments, and it can be enjoyable in parts, but it would be difficult to go out of my way to recommend it 
 Those who expect vocals by the featured singer Bocelli will be disappointed.  He only sings one selection.  The selections are almost completely instrumental and choral 
 Siegel presents an interesting view of the next few decades and how to profit off them. With the book, he had to do two things: prove that "Stocks For The Long Run" still works and join in on the many books about the effect of demographics on equities.  Siegel's portfolio theories are the strength of the book. Compounding dividends and the mean aversion theory of stocks have been a success. The time period Siegel uses to come up with hypothetical returns has been the best 50 years for US markets, so one can only hope it continues.  Siegel's demographic models show that Harry S. Dent's Age Wave gets completely absorbed by rising middle-classes around the world and several other smaller solutions. But the numbers just don't add up and I mean that quite literally. This is one of the largest demographic problems the planet has seen in 500 years. I fully expect some sacrifice coming up. Too many people owe too much money.  In case of a worst case scenario, such as those in "The Next Great Bubble Boom," "The Coming Generational Storm," "Empire of Debt," and Prechtor/Folsom's daily newsletters, Siegel recommends TIPS. Read that again. TIPS during a period of deflation.  I don't know what the future will bring, but at least I know what a business professor's computer models think will happen. If you're set on reading this book, be sure to read "Stocks For The Long Run" first 
 I have read everybook Karen Kingsbury has written and I have to say that I struggled to finish this one. Most of her books are written with many plot lines, this book sad to say was very slow and boring. She attempted to make so much out of one thought and it did not work well. I hope that she returns to her previous style of writing. I would not recommend this book to anyone if that had not read her before. I am positive that they would be "left deflated. 
 The only great thing about this book is its small size and thats about it. The text doesn't do a very good job of explaining the ideas and concepts. Say you are given certain parts of an equation it doesn't really show you how to use to components to solve for the right number. Instead it gives you a wonderful GENERAL overview of an idea that is minimal in explanation. I'm almost at the point of flipping out because the lack of explanations and I'm only on Chapter 2 
 We purchased this book to use in our accelerated curriculum since we have a substantial vocabulary unit connected to Frankenstein.  However, a few days into the book, we are noticing major departures from Mary Shelley's novel.  Kaplan has irresponsibly marketed this book as if it is the original version.  
 The climax of the "Night's Dawn" trilogy reminds me of the cartoon where one scientist is explaining to another a complex formula written on a blackboard.  The first scientist is pointing at a rectangle labeled "A Miracle Happens Here."  The second scientist says, "A good start, but this part needs more work."  Similarly, as other reviewers have noted, Hamilton ends his series with a technological magic wand.  In so doing, his protagonist ends the crisis of humanity without resolving the underlying problem, guaranteeing that the disturbed dead will pile up again, just waiting for that crack between realities to come pouring in.  Given that lack of resolution, I was flabbergasted that older and wiser Kiint race would rush to help in the aftermath of the war with the possessed.  It seemed far-fetched that a race advanced enough to have a governing cooperating race intelligence (the Corpus) would fail to recognize that the human race had merely dodged the bullet, not unloaded the gun.  Hamilton created a completely involving universe with the "Night's Dawn" trilogy.  The characters were little more than stereotypes (though wonderfully odd at times), but the scope and details of his universe seduced me.  Providing such a swift and shallow end to his tale was like ending a wonderfully romantic evening by having your date tell you that s/he had a lovely time, but s/he has to go home to pack, because s/he's moving out of town tomorrow 
 Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?   The "sculpting stick" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.   Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think 
 Doesn't work on coarse hairs.  Doesn't remove, only trims.  Okay for fine light hair--of course, if you have fine, light hair, you don't need to try to remove 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I am a huge disney fan and collector.  I have the other cd's from baby einstein to the cd of songs from the movies and my whole family loves them.  This cd was recorded in 1979!  It is a old man whom I don't find very pleasant.  I prefer the 'normal' childrens cd's.  I bought this cd and returned it within 15 minutes 
 I bought this after being intrigued by Tom Waits' comment that Shakin' the Rafters is the greatest rock and roll record of all time. If that's why you are checking it out, forget it because there is very little rock and roll here. I knew this CD was going to be gospel music when I ordered it and some gospel really rocks, but after hearing this I could not imagine what the fuss is about. The music, particularly the keyboards, is very weak and the singing, while inspired, is amateurish. There is a lot better gospel music to listen to on the market than this. Celebrity endorsements aren't any better than anyone else's, but I took a chance on Waits' assessment of this CD since his tastes in music are famously eclectic and mine are as well. Looks like I lost my bet here, I won't be playing this one much. If you buy this, you should do so for the message, but certainly not for the music 
 To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.  Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.  But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.  I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.  For fans only.. 
 the first 50 pages are good and explore interesting philosophical concepts, based upon Robert Ringer's life. The rest of the book is frankly mediocre. We do live in a different world indeed, and its seems that the "turtoise" has a hard time dealing with it 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook.  I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore.  What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving.  It's read like a "see spot run" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting.  I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting.  Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out.    
 It was difficult to assign a "star rating" for this book. It is a classic, for sure. It's definately a good book. However, I don't think I'd recommend it for most readers, and hence the low rating.  Like all of Knuth's "Art of Programming" books, this one is really starting to age. Like other reviewers, I really don't like the MIX assembly examples. (MIX is a fictional computer that he invented purely for the purpose of teaching.) His rationale for using MIX is because he says that he doesn't want to just discuss topics in theory, sometimes it's necessary to show how it's actually implemented. He does this in MIX. He says that he chose MIX, rather than any actual existing machine language, so that it wouldn't be out of date or be tied to a particular platform. Unfortuanetly, there are several problems with the MIX examples:  * First, it's assembly language. I used to do lots of assembly language. (I make video games.) Now I do almost none at all. In general, very few programmers do assembly language programming. I understand how in many cases using a high-level language could possibly have glossed over some of the details. However, still, I think a language like C is sufficiently low level that he could have acheived the same results with C, and it would have been much more readable and accessible to today's audience.  Also, when Knuth wrote his first books, C was just being born, and since then, it has become a lingua franca in the computer science community.  * MIX is purposely contrived to be "weird" (6-bit word size???)  * Most importantly, using a fictious computer system introduces an unnecessary extra step to understanding the examples. Not only do you have to learn the material, but you have to wade through learning MIX - information you won't use anywhere else. I know that any of C, Java, Pascal, x86, MIPS, etc would have had people who didn't know that language and so it would have been an impediment to them. Unfortunatly, Knuth has chosen a language that NOBODY knows and so EVERYBODY has this extra learning curve.  The books are also really heavy on the math. I think it's not unfair to say that these books are more math books than they are computer books. Knuth is famous for setting computer science on a mathematical foundation. He proves everything and RIGOROUSLY discusses the math behind every topic. For some readers, this is enlightening. Now I am not shy on math (I wrote a book on 3D math myself) however I usually found the detailed proofs unnecessary. I also wish he would have expressed ideas in English more that equations. For example, Knuth would never write "the elements sum to one" - instead, he'd have an equation using sigma notation. Which is consise and precise and in some sense "elegent" - but it takes a lot of mental "work" to read. I think many readers will share this sentiment.  Some people include the phrase "the information is timeless."  Yeah, this is true.  But the presentation style is not.  There other books with the same "timeless" information, and a more up-to-date style of presentation.  I personally use Sedgewick's algorithm's book.  An interesting anecdote on how much I have been actually able to use this book - perhaps it will help you estimate if you will get enough use out of it to justify the price tag. We discovered that the rand() function in the C library on the PS2 was buried underneath several layers of funtion calls and checks for different random number modes, etc, and it was causing a performance problem, and we needed to write a replacement. I was thrilled. Finally, an opportunity to pull the Knuth off the shelf! This book is one of the the bibles on random numbers. I looked for advice on chosing A and C for the linear congruential generator. There was SOOOO much information. (The first 190 pages of the 2nd volume deal with random numbers.) It was all very facinating. Yet in the end, we dug up the gcc source for rand() and just used the numbers they chose!   
 I'm so disappointed.  I thought I would hear new songs by this artist but instead heard old melodies from the past.  Too bad that I didn't sample the CD in advance; I would not have purchased it 
 I thought this would be more than a "You go, Girl!" book of cheers. I was wrong. There might be a few passages that are encouraging to read, and thats valuable. However, I bought this and a few other books to expand my knowledge on the art of seduction and influence... my mistake 
 This is NOT a book for non-physicists.  I have a doctorate in Dentistry and began reading the book, thinking it would become less obtuse.  Ten pages later, I resorted to flipping each page in the hope that I would find something that made sense to a "layman"...no such luck. It could have been written in a medieval Persian language and I would have learned as much from it.   
 Let me say right up front I did not read this book. However, I heard a talk the author gave in 2000, in which she made the following "predictions".  1. The euro would fail as a currency. 2. Great Britain would not enter the EU.  Additionally, to paraphrase, she said that no one in their right mind would trade FOREX; you should trade futures instead. Finally, she showed overhead projections of various technical indicators, some of which she couldn't explain. Huh???  I was all set to buy this book until I heard her talk. For all I know, the book may be excellent, but based on her presentation, I'm not as enthusiastic about spending the 40 bucks.  Just my opinion, and you know what they say about those.. 
 I've sat through more than my fair share of pretentious films in my attempt to escape Hollywood's drivel.  Based on the cast and the strength of the film maker, I thought Holy Smoke would have a good script, strong performances and something to say.  Indeed, the film began with much promise, only to bogged down by what I would call an awful second and dreadful third act.  How the characters get from point A to point F is beyond me and certainly not motivated by what was shown on the screen.  If this movie was designed to question the roles of men and women in religious circles, question physical vs. mental domination in relationships, or question choices vs. others' perceptions of those choices, it would have been a worthwhile use of kodak film.  In the end, the film suffers from too many ideas, too little cohesion and too much self-importance.  I would suggest avoiding this film, almost as much as I would avoid Gigli.  
 RIIIIING!!!!!  Not only boring, but poorly organized, executed and written (and, did I mention, boring??)  After struggling through a few chapters, I tried skimming ahead just to see what was going to happen.  Unfortunately, I couldn't even do that because not much actually happens in the first 150 pages, and that which does is so convoluted and unclear, and written in such awful prose, that it is hard to follow.  Additionally, although the world is about to come to an end in the story (maybe), I did not really care about the characters, who are more wooden than Billy Baldwin's acting.  Can I be any more clear?   This book is terrible.   As far as the writing goes, I'll give you a few choice gems to whet your appetite in case you still want to give this mess a shot:  "Some of the outfits attracted her.   Others were positively puritanical--- in a slinky sort of way."    (Hmmm... those slinky, puritanical outfits.  Can't you just imagine them?!?)  "Men's clothing was no less flamboyant, or somber..." (Looks like men's clothing is also flamboyantly somber.  Wish Versace could take a hint from those futuristic, flamboyantly somber humans!)  "Many of the spellings had been simplified or-paradoxically--made more complex." (Gosh!  Both simplified AND more complex?  How paradoxical!  Guess we've covered all the bases there!)  So, if you'd like to read a spectacularly bad, though paradoxically un-good, science fiction disaster, with unexpectedly trite, though inconceivably wooden, prose about astoundingly boring, though unexpectedly laconic, characters, I would highly recommend this disturbingly terrible, though hopelessly awful, book 
 Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.   However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.   That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.   You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs! 
 I would have given it a negative star.  This is not an electronic device and it cannot use boiling water.  I agree with the previous comment that by putting boiling water in a cup will produce more steam than this device 
 As an OCD sufferer and someone well-versed on the subject, I know that Levenkron's claim that underparenting causes OCD is absolutely ludicrous. I hope no unsuspecting readers pick this up as their first introduction to the subject and actually believes this. OCD is a biological and chemical brain disorder. While underparenting certainly may cause problems, it doesn't cause OCD. More helpful, suggested authors: Ian Osborn, Jenike, Penze 
 I can deal with the coy jokes scattered within the side-notes.  I can handle the briefity of each section.  But there are a lot of concepts that the authors just jump right into without explaining what the terms mean or the tools involved.  What is "asphaltum"?  Don't you think that it should be defined before jumping into an entire section on it?  I'm not above looking things up, but I don't think that I should have to supplement an instructional book for beginners.  The authors are kind enough to share recipes; most gilding books list the general ingredients and then encourage you to experiement with your portions to get a working recipe.  But, the book seems to create more questions than it provides answers 
 A Child's Golden Book of Ayn Rand... Why in the world would someone take the time and trouble to publish a book without acquainting himself with the facts of his subject's life?  This book is a superficial, riddled with  errors and worthwhile only for the photos 
 This book was sent to me by a well-meaning relative. I started reading it about a month before I gave birth and could not get past the judgemental tone of the book. It made it seem like you are a bad Mother if you decide to ween your child or decide to have anything but a drug-free, natural birth. The whole book read like an advertisement for the Le Leche League. I had every intention of breastfeeding, and still do. But reading this made me reluctant to attend any of the La Leche League meetings or calling them for help 
 OK. I am a neophite and what better book than this one. Or so it would seem until I tried to install the included DVD which contains Fedora Core 2 Linux. Insert the DVD and reboot then the get the intro screen asking if you want a graphical or textual install. I selected graphical and it started then rebooted the PC. I tried this several times. The PC I am using is based on a VIA EPIA Eden CPU motherboard and Fedora Core 1 installs just fine 
 My 3 dogs recently start fighting and was frantic about what to do since they live inside with me 24/7. I had fights that landed one of my dogs in the ER room so this was a serious problem. I  have obedience trained all my dogs so I am not a novice. I   heard this author on the local radio station where I live and thought his book may be helpful. It was not. It is very basic stuff I already knew. I found Patricia McConnell, PH.D.'s 30 page pamphlett "The Cautious Canine"to be much more helpful than this author's 230 page book. If your problem is strickly aggression and or fearful shy dogs then this book does not address enough detail about what to do.  I think it may be a good book for any new or inexperienced dog owner that covers basics. I have since restored peace in my house with some new ground rules and appointing the right dog to alpha status so it can be done 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 This book is unbelievably tedious and repetitious. There is very little actual content for the length of the book. It takes nearly 200 pages just to define some very basic terms from graph theory. This might have been fine if the space were taken up by some sort of meaningful discussion on the relevance of these graph theory concepts to sociological studies and theory. The book (possibly the field?) has the flavor of "here's a hammer, now what can we hit with it?".  Would have liked to see a format based on justification of the analytic techniques from sociological principles, or something much much more concise. Nothing much to see here, move on 
 Vickers just can't write!  He's fantastic in an archive and here has gathered an excellent array of facts from numerous sources.  He has also done an excellent job of putting everything together.  But he just isn't at all a good writer.  His style is awkward and clumpsy - he doesn't know how to effectivel tell a story.  How he got as far as he did is a modern wonder.  AND the cause of the book, being in effect comissioned by Prince Philip, was also it's death, as it is extremely prejudiced in presenting only what the palace wants us to know and believe.  There are numerous unpleasant and controversial facts about the historical characters in the book which are neatly omitted, and Alice is always sympathetically and gallantly focused.  No even-handed critique or analysis here - just a nice Windsor-approved glowing tribute, and poorly written 
 or save yourself the effort by burning your money to keep warm instead of buying this abomination.  This pathetic waste of human flesh was a notorious liar famous for the "refrigerator mother" myth.  He was found to have abused the patients entrusted to his care and eventually died at his own hand.  Enough said 
 If you want good old Three 6 dont waste your time with this. Get Mystic Stylez, Then End, and ESPECIALLY CH.2 World Domination, that CD is tha ish 
 I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it.  A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective.  MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west.  Secondly, Nazi helicopters?  This is just plain sloppy.  MacLean should have known much better.  This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.  For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island.  The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.  A poor effort by Mr MacLean 
 I read this book and it made me so upset to think that the author would dare to run our foremothers into the muck that she writes.  There is no such reason to make the foremothers seem like they were unhappy performing "traditionally feminine roles" or enbittered because of them.  Priorities were much different back then and it took A LOT more physical and time consuming work to run a household and make a living than it does in the 21st century.    I am afraid this book will push many females away from Judaism. This book starts with a belief that Judaism is a male chauvinistic religion, and does its best to "prove" this the case.  The author misses out on many of the beautiful commentaries about our foremothers.  When she does include these stories, she dissmisses them as being from another religion or as proof of bible written by humans - which both contribute to deligitamizing the stories.  So much more could have been learned and glorify our foremothers and all of the wonderous things that they performed.  I recommend you steer clear of this book! If you are looking to learn about our foremothers and what Judaism feels about women choose another book.  Please realize that there are many other lessons to be learned from the stories that she tells and there are others that are not included 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 I have been a loyal Sony product user for over 30 years.  However, their Compact Disc Recorder RCD-W500C/W100 is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that I have ever seen.  It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.  For instance, why does it need a remote?  How many people will be cutting CDs from their easy chairs?  I have a call in to two friends who I hope can rescue me from my dilemma 
 This product was only good for about 1 week.  The inner light went out and that makes it very difficult to see. I have written to the company I purchased from, asking them to exchange it and I have yet to receive a response. I'm out the $59.95 I paid for it, plus tax and shipping. It was a birthday present for my fiancee and I am extremey dissappointed and thinking about filing charges against Fine Things II for stealing my money. 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 I was disappointed with this book.  I found it to be mostly out of date and very dry and difficult to get through.  It also is missing a key part of any guide book: a map.  I thought the illustrations were very poorly done... just childish line drawings where photographs would've been much better.  I'd say skip this one and get the lonely planet one instead 
 For all those who are interested in reading this book (after reading the glowing tributes paid to it by ignorant and biased christians) please note that the author is a proven and blatant LIAR. If you are truly in search of truth and not simply looking to strengthen what you want to believe( as must be the case with most of the people writing here) then you owe it to yourself to at least know about this man more before taking his word for the truth. Read his book but please visit http://www.ahmed-deedat.co.za/homepage.asp to purchase a video of a stunning debate that took place between dr anis and sheikh ahmed deedat (a famous muslim sholar)as a companion peace to this book. Believe me you will learn a lot more that way...that is if you really are in search of TRUTH 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I am glad I read this book before I saw Johnny Damon in a Yankee uniform, because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader. Damon is in love with himself, talks trash about his ex-wife and the whole book sounds like a bad tv interview. I can happily look at Johnny Damon in Yankee gear and know it's no loss to the Red Sox 
 Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of "a line allows prgress"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  "a perfect sonnet".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: "on my way to work" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better 
 This is a book of pleasantries for people who are easily influenced and can't think about what they're reading.  "Find the positive!" it says.  If your life is hell, look at the pretty shiny fire.  The author makes points that range from valid but unhelpful to contradictory and moronic 
 This movie is a lot of fun, Parker Posey at her best, but don't buy it as it has been cut up for TVs. Wait for the widescreen version so you can see it as the filmmakers intended. Full-frame is an insult to moviegoers everywhere 
 I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera

 The content of this book is only common sense steps... and targeted for completely disorganized people. For those using their brain before acting, do not buy this book: you won't find any secret, nor precious tips. But if you're a teen and wonder how to start a consulting business in the future: it could be a good investment. I bought the ebook edition, at least I didn't waste paper... Alan Weiss should learn more Japanese, because the word "sogomi" (at page 8!) doesn't exist. This mistake gives you the level of this book 
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 I found this story so-so. The characters and plot were bland. Lil, the main character, is very materialistic to the point of nausea. I really wanted this to be a good book but all that I cared was pushing myself to the end. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters as long as the book was over. Sorry 
 We purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use. We make probably 20-30 cups of coffee a day. Our problems began the first week after receiving it. The machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam, which lattes shouldn't have. So customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy. We called the manufacturer's customer service and were rudely brushed off. For a small business like us it is hard to close for 2-3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service, so we had to deal with it. Another problem came up 3-4 weeks later, when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming/frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle. Sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate, just to steam milk. At the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours, which we did. It did not shut off for 1 day! The next day the problem started again...  I perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily, so you can not say that the machine is being neglected.  We are very disappointed with this machine. For the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite, understanding and helpful. Now we are looking for another machine, a back up one, to be able to send Impressa Z5 for service.. 
 i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit, but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting. The ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world.Dont even rent this, i dont even know why you are considering the film.  I only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since. 
 Look closely at the picture of the "white" top.  It actually has red around the top and on the straps.  To those of us who don't want ugly red zig-zag thread....... 
 never receieved this item.  contacted company, told me it was the shipping fault.  
 In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that I found mose running through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 Ok, I'm missing the 'Genius' here. Being a huge KJ fan I find this double CD terribly egotistical and equally unlistenable. I agree 100% with the 1 star review below.  Basically what you get is a bunch of random improvisation (the 3 instrumentalists playing 3 different songs at once). There are a few sweets spots when Jarrett decides to stop playing random disonnace but for the most part this is Jazz grandstanding at it's worst. Lack of melody, rythym or coherency. Just ego. Even worse, Jarrett's signature vocal atonal grunts, moans and squeaks are here in full force to detract from what quality Jazz there is. I'll stick with his standards. 
 The Christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves, with our communities and with the world. All too often it isn't, and Steven James' target is a good one. Sadly this book is both overwritten and repetitive, and remarkably self-involved. Difficult to recommend 
 I bought this for my cavalier after watching the Petsmart commercial. I understand it is not the same toy, but it bears some resemblence. It came in a dreadful yellow color and was not extremely well made. It was a soft, somewhat cottony/furry texture, not loofah! I couldn't tell you if it is durable, because he hasn't played with it enough to actually rip it.  It contains two squeakers that scare him.  My guess is some dogs would like this toy, the shape is pleasing to dogs, I think my dog just didn't like the texture. I reccommend anything by Fat Cat Inc. in place of this toy 
 If you are looking for a good book about Sylvia Browne- this is not the one for you!  I guess I was hoping for a few more stories from his childhood.  I understand that Chris is a first time author- but I found his  writing hard to read bouncing from subject to subject.  I also felt that he  told a lot of the same stories that I have read in some of his mother's  books.  If you want some good reading stick with Sylvia 
 I picked up this book based on the recommendation by Stephen King in Danse Macabre. I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it. I am sure more forgiving readers will enjoy the novel, but I personally expect a novel to be structured in a way to encourage the reader to keep reading. Unfortunately for me, it ceased to be fun and became a chore instead.  This is only the third book that I have started reading and didn't finish in my entire life. It was that bad for me. With the praise I keep reading about Straub, I would be willing to give him another shot. But it won't be this book 
 I'd love to write a review about the movie, unfortunately, after many install and reboot, I could not download it! Customer support was not helpful and blamed my DSL connection. I have downloaded movies from iTunes and MovieLink and never had problems before, so the explanation did not really resonate with me. Don't use this service.. 
  Basic beginner information.Booklet was not what I hoped but still has some good areas 
 Derrida gets 2 stars for FINALLY coming around to writing about social and political issues. The book itself is interesting, but the fact of the matter is, it's not good Marxism. He's remained ambiguous even since the 1968 French University protests of 1968. His only discussions of Marx revolved around his critique of Hegel, and I believed he dropped Lenin's name a few times in "Positions". Still, Derrida's entry into Marxism is a disappointing one. While he never claims to be a Marxist, one would expect him to be aware of the basic tenents of Marxism. The problem with Derrida's book is it's fetishism of the spirit. The specter takes precedence over the material. Ultimately, Derrida misses the point of historical materialism completely. History is ALWAYS present...there is no specter. In Marx's view we are always creating our own history, as part of our nature as human beings. Furthermore, Derrida's dialectics in the book is far from dialectical materialism. Despite what he claims to be a thorough reading of the German Ideology, he falls into the same traps of the Young Hegelians Marx critiques. His dialectics posits an a priori state, beyond history, language, and everything. Derrida claims he doesnt but this "presence non-presence" of the specter applies something beyond both the material and memory. Regardless, neither of these options suit Marx.  Consciousness (das Basswussein I believe?) is the life-blood of the human being, and her/his existence. It is material in and of itself. There is no to come, it is always in process, always becoming, it is in transition. It is not a state of being as "to" implies...it IS being. Anyone who wants a refutation of Derrida need merely read the "camera obscura" passage of the German Ideology. Furthermore, had Derrida read MORE early Marx, and paid attention to the seminal importance of the "Grundrisse" in linking humanism to the political critique and the economic critique, he might've been more clear on what dialecitcal and historical materialism entail. We see how historical materialism is a humanism. (If anyone notices a similarity to the Sartre essay "Existentialism is a Humanism", kudos...it has a purpose. I think Derrida (and even Marx himself) would've benefited from Sartre's reading of Marx. Anyone who would like a nice concise exposition of that reading that has some familiarity with Marx need only read Sartre's "Search for a Method").  Derrida's clear misreading of Marx will make the book a confusing and misleading read for anyone not already familair with Marx, so I recommend read the Econ./Phil. Manuscripts, Chapters 1, 5, 6, 7, 19, 25 of Capital, , the 1st 15 pages of the Ger. Ideo., and the intro to the Grundrisse and the intro to the Contribution to the Critique of Pol. Econ. or at least SOME of the above writings by Marx. (Another complaint not related to Derrida's reading of Marx is his statement that justice is undeconstructible. Why? The quasi-universal cop out is annoying. Thats a contradiction in terms...I think Derrida needs to stop with the Heideggerian wordplay and make up his mind about foundationalism and deconstruction.) Still, Derrida writes some startlingly beautiful passages about social justice (the part that talks about how "never even the histroy of the world have their been more people starved, killed, and disenfranchised at the hands of a government or should I say empire" or something like that. But flashy rhetoric and Derrida's impeccable, yet esoteric writing style cannot save him from the fact that ultimately his own lack of theoretical grounding, practicality, and activism prevents one from acheiving any praxis from this book. Its merely another interesting exposition of Derrida's thought (mental masturbation). It's a Coney island sideshow...seductive and alluring at first glance, but it looes its luster, interest and shock after repeated visits. Specters of Marx is more frustrating than it is fresh 
 I was very disappointed in the book. Unfortunately, there's at least as much ranting from the author about his views of what's wrong with the political left, and as much of his glorifying of the political right, as there is info about blogs.  Info about blogs seemed to be only a backdrop from which to share his strong right-wring political views.  If you are a strong right-winger, buy the book.  Otherwise, if you are a centrist, on the left, or interested primarily in blogs, don't buy this book.  
 As a fan of Indian fiction I was really excited to read this novel.  I had read a glowing review on it and put my name on the local library list for it. Boy was I disappointed! The writing was overly simple and dull.  Ramchand, the main character, elicited no sympathy from me.  I never felt like the author adequately explained the inner turmoil that was so central to his character. Overall I found the book depressing 
 Blondie has always either hit or miss, which was an admiral quality they possesed. None of their albums totally hit the mark, bt they dared to explore.Here, nothing hits the mark period. It's grating, abbrasive, tuneless and a mess. It's bad, real bad.What ever happened to Jimmy Destri's solo effort from 1981 Heart On A Wall? If you can find it cheap, get it instead. There are 2 good songs on it. "My Little World" and "Little Metal Drummer" with Debbie doing background vocals on this western flavored instrumental 
 PLEASE know the difference between a desorator who selects fabrics and finishes only and a designer who most often creates full sets of construction documents for their clients....including but not limited to, demolition plans, construction plans, electrical plans, lighting plans, life safety plans, millwork, wall and ceiling details, cross sections and elevations...etc.  THIS BOOK IS MISSLABELED AND GIVES DESIGNERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL FOR 5 1/2 + YEARS A TITLE OF A DECORATOR WHICH BY NO MEANS IS THE SAME!!! This book is for decorators, not designers.... do not be mislead....check out the table of contaents before purchasing

 Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the "Frankenstein-like" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.  Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.  Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's "The Beyond" ranks way 'beyond' this however 
 Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.  You will learn very little about how to change anyone's mind or your own.  Reading this book and finishing it is a grind 
 I hope "Duets: The Final Chapter" is the last thing released by BIG. Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make money off of Biggie's old material and let him rest in peace. "Duets: The Final Chapter" just contains old Biggie material remixed and re-worked into new songs. The only release I want to see of Biggie is to have "Ready to Die" back into print and a 10th anniversary of "Life after death" in 2007 wouldn't bother me too much. Buy Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make new Biggie material by re-working his old material. And acording to Amazon's editorial reviews of tis product, There will be a limited edition CD/DVD which includes never before seen performance footage, celebrity interviews and vintage Biggie videos. That dvd needs it own release. This cd is not good at all. The only decent tracks on this cd are the ones with his other and kids. And That is where I tunes come in handy. I wouldn't be surpised if Bad Boy released their own version of Queen Latifah's "Dana Ownes Album" entitled "The Christopher Wallace Album" 
 I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 This was the worst darn book I ever read.  I read it last year and never want to read it again.  It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food "food of the gods."  Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book.  It was terrible.  I hated it.  If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!! 
 I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I don't feel that the yoga exercises are for beginners - they are very difficult to do.  
 This book absolutely broke my heart.  I think about all the young seekers out there looking for a mosel of truth, looking toward an Emerging Church Leader like Mr. McLaren for teaching, and then being let down once again.  I talked with non-believer friend of mine who read the book - he absolutley loved it - he remarded that this book was a sigh of relief in that he is confident that he is saved, no matter what he believes.  This book is leading people astray and that is really a painful thing to see.  If you are not a mature Christian that can discern between God's Truth and Satan's ingenious and subtle deception, I would be very cautious of this book.  It is packed with half-truths - one can almost hear Satan tempting Eve in the garden and Jesus in the dessert as you read through this absolute philosophical dribble. Mature Christians should read this book so they can be aware of what they'll be coming up against as they spread the Good New of Jesus Christ. 
 Joel Lane writes well and his descriptions are good. The stories themselves, however, are disturbing and leave one with unsettling thoughts. 
 The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated. As someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area, I found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information. Not a good choice if you are a novice. Too bad I could not give it zero stars 
 I was disappointed in this book.  I missed in the description that the author uses anecdotes about other children.  I don't care for books that are written that way.  I don't want stories of others and this book is full of them.  I just want straight foward common sense advice.  Read descriptions of books very carefully before purchasing.  
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors.  It is comprised of short stories -- often rather verbose short stories -- rather than the short, meaningful passages in the earlier Chicken Soup books.  The earlier books are studded with post-it stickers saving the innumerable passages I want to reread or frame, and I frequently think back to those wonderful passages.  Not these -- there isn't a single post-it sticker in the entire book, and I'm donating it to the charity fair since there's nothing worth rereading.  To be fair, I suppose that this might prove helpful to someone overwhelmed by insurmountable problems and in need of reading sappy boring story after sappy boring story -- but I, myself, was much more humbled and inspired by the earlier volumes 
 I typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out.  The plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story.  The writing was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish it.  Phrases like "God damn, Oh god, etc..." were repeated over and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive.  The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.  It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing.  I'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin romances... 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned 
 I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.  Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with "cosmic" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.   Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud 
 Suzanne Hansen must have read The Nanny Diaries and said to herself, "Hey! I was a nanny for some famous and important people and I hated my job. I can write a book like that."  Only she can't, and she didn't. She uses actual names and claims this is a true story but unfortunately, making it real doesn't make it good. There is name-dropping (so much it becomes tedious) and sure, Hansen was a nanny for an unreasonable family, but that's as far as it goes. This book lacks any of the warmth, the genuineness, and the realism that made The Nanny Diaries so fun and touching. Hansen tells the story of her year as a nanny for the Ovitz family with no seeming rhyme or reason. The narrative lurches forward in a series of anecdotes that seem to exist completely on their own. It's simply a walk down memory lane, (plagued by corny jokes) not an actual story with a point.   The characters may be based on real people, but they are not real here. We never get to know any of them and consequently, we don't really care about them. Hansen waves her paper dolls at us and tells us how we're SUPPOSED to feel about them, but we never actually feel anything. Everyone is flat and dreadfully uninteresting; even Michael Ovitz, who is supposed to by a dynamic and forceful personality, is bland.  The children, who we are supposed to care for and worry about, are so badly written that they barely even register and make no impression.  Even if the characters were better written, the protagonist is so loathsome that it's hard to sympathize or care about her. Her "hick from the sticks" routine quickly grows old and she spends the entire book whining about how underappreciated and used she feels and how mean these rich people are. She is selfish and completely self-centered - the very behavior she accuses her employers of.  She even condones employees stealing from their employers, reasoning the employers deserve it because they are so wealthy.    Hansen admits all this happened some time ago and the story is dreadfully out of date. The name-dropping is a line-up of has-been celebrities no one cares about now.  We may have loved Cheers and Family Ties in the 80s, but most of us don't now.  (In fact, many readers are likely too young to even remember those shows!)  Added to this is the character's unfortunate crush on Tom Cruise, who has recently proven that he's a lunatic.  It's hard to like a girl who's gaga over such a ridiculous person.   Too lifeless for those who want a good read and not enough dirt for those looking for some good Hollywood gossip. The whole book seems like a dated, sad grab for the coattails of its more popular, better written predecessor. There are really only two reasons for Hansen to write this story so long after the fact - money or revenge. Either motive makes her just as petty and vindictive as the Hollywood family she writes about 
 Nice table of contents, but each section was littered with poor writing and repetitive comments about how great radiant heating is.  This is obviously just a hidden manufacturer's pitch for radiant heating products 
 The iShock II WILL NOT work on Intel Macs, and per Macally' website, they have no intention of releasing an Intel- compatible driver for the iShock II.  Don't waste your time on his product like I did 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 Nothing inside, nothing usefull, 9$ for nothing. All my applause to be such a good salesman, you could sell fridge in north pole ! But for event planing..... All what is essential in this book is to not buy it 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 Net10 cell phones are great, but don't buy this card.  Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards.  I put the pin # in my phone and did not receive the minutes.  I called technical support and received 1000 minutes.  I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days.  DON'T BUY THIS CARD 
 I saw this book at my company's library and was drawn by it's title. The description on the back and the introduction to the book gave me hopes of a refreshing read -- one written with distinct style and offering insight.   The saying is true -- don't judge a book by it's cover. I found this book to be annoying because Jensen is repetitive and offers no significant insight. He spends the first section of the book drilling the same ideas, making generic declarations and offering minimal real life examples. Worst of all -- not one "aha" moment, which is what he calls this section. Of course simplicity is better -- I realize that and it's why I picked the book up -- but repeating this a lot is not necessary.  I had to stop reading the book halfway. I agree with one of the reviewers who referred to the book as unreadable. I can't read a book that generalizes what everyone is always doing wrong, and then tells me what to do "based on research." Little data is offered to back up the claims.   All in all -- I wasn't inspired by the book, wasn't impressed with its style, and wasn't instructed by its content (its first half is all I read).   Recommendation: Your money and time could be better spent elsewhere. If the book is at no charge, and you are curious, try reading the first section to see if you feel the same way 
 Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.  Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from. If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 I think all of the purses in this book are simply "too too."  Maybe they wouldn't look so bad in less busy fabrics with a little less detail, but the author just can't seem to hold back and the result if unprofessional and too cutesy 
 My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well 
 I love Niki Burnham's work...usually.  This book disgusted me!  Chloe, the main character, spent chapters complaining about her amazing looks.  About the zits she never gets, the weight she never gains, the envious stares she recieves, and as a teenage girl who does get the zits, does gain the weight, and is nto often the bearer of those unbearable stares it frustrated me to no end to listen to that.  I put down the book nearly immeadiately because my self esteem was completely and devastatingly shattered.  Thanks Niki, thanks a lot 
 I bought this because of the great reviews.  I think it's awefully boring.  The writer takes this tone, like parents are morons with no common sense.  I hated it and returned right away. 
 Great recording, but if you want to actually use it, like load it on your ipod it has sony's stupid DRM. Meaning you can't. DON'T BUY SONY PRODUCTS!! 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 After 6 months of use, the handle holder on the lid came off due to fatigue at welding joints.  Since the other pieces also uses spot welding at the handle, I'm fearful for my safety and contacted Sitram Customer Support.  This is their response  "While we have the ability to authorize replacement for the defective products that have handles coming off, we are unable to satisfy a request to credit other product that has not shown signs of being defective"  In otherwords, they're not surprised the product is defective and I'm not the only one complaining.  If I'm stupid enough to buy a whole set, then I'll have to return each item as it falls apart.  Too bad if the defective will maim me in the process.  Stay away from this defective and inferior product if you value your health and safety.   BTW, I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they agreed to accept the return.  Love Amazon. 
 What can I say.  Decent graphics and a typical comic book story.  Unlikely to satisfy adults.  Again, OK, but hardly a revolutionary work of any kind 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 I'm still searching for a really amazing, knock my socks off Adobe Acrobat book, that will take me beyond what I could find in the Acrobat help, or figure out myself.  I can capably make a PDF from Word or any other application, I don't care about embedding multimedia, and I still see a sore need to find a book that covers forms really well.  This book fails both the breadth test and the depth test; it might as well be one of the "dummies" books.  Thanks for nothing 
 This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release 
 I picked up this book because I thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids.  They enjoyed "The Animal Farm" a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals.  But I guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer.  This ones almost downright depressing.  Plus theres sex!  Good thing I read ahead a little bit or I would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure.  I guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80's but it wont fly in 2006 I tell you what.    Why is there no option for ZERO STARS?!?  Oh well ONE STAR for you then Mr. Orwell 
 What a disappointing waste of money, and for that matter, time also.  However I have since bought a book that ,unlike this one, actually gives RESULTS and in the first week! It's by a psychiatrist, Richard Brown, called "Stop Depression Now".  If you want results -that's the one that works. but That's just my opinion and I'm going by the personal experiences of my clients- which some have been amazing following Browns book because it's simple, effective and to the point 
 This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed.  The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her  feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the  feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The  author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a  happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a  stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact 
 Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one 
 I was disappointed after reading 3 chapters of this book. Leafing forward, the book is saturated with SAS examples that I not only cannot understand but do not care about. It seems the whole book was written just to promote the (sold separately)...CD ROM with source SAS code. If you are going to write a SAS book, label it as such 
 I purchased this book based on the reviews posted. However, it didn't live up to my expectations. What little advice he actually gives is basic common sense. He says this is what every woman needs to know about catching a man. Well, if you're in need of this very basic instruction, finding a man should not be your first priority. Also, he has padded the book heavily with quotes. I guess this is an attempt to compensate for the lack of original material. If you eliminated all of the quotes and references to other works, you'd be left with little more than a pamplet. If you are a single woman, and you are serious about finding a nice guy remember patience is a virtue. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you're in the market for a book of relationship quotes. This book gets one star only because of the clever fishing metaphor used 
 This is one of the worst college resources out of the hundreds already in print.  The book does little more than list the general statistics of the thousands of colleges in the United States, making it the size of a phone book.  The text offers little insight into the character of the school and leaves a college bound student even more confused than before.  All this information and more can be found at the collegeboard website(for free), where it is much easier to navigate.  This resource may be helpful for a counselor, but is useless for an individual student. 
 Much of the writing is beautiful and evocative, but it's hard to know what's going on.  The summaries posted here have more "plot" in them than is easily gleaned from the book.  Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters.  You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names.  There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well.  I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it.  At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it.  I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant.  This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care 
   This book was a huge dissapointment.  Every single layout was the same. Arrange your sofa and loveseat facing each other, throw a crappy plant against the wall.  The pictures were dated looking and in black and white.    There is nothing this book has to offer that you cannot glean from watching 1  evening of HGTV 
 There is a need for a book that provides a comprehensive history of Hollywood, but this book is not it. That book would weave personal, industry, and critical history together and would require thousands of hours of research, an excellent ability to organize and analyze data, etc, and of course, the ability to write.  Having just read a wonderful book on Hollywood history "An Empire of Their Own," I was in search of another book to deepen my knowledge. Unfortunately, having read that book makes me see how sloppy this book is.   Not only does Thompson gloss over "industry" history, to instead focus on personal ancedotes, the "stories" he chooses have either been told a thousand times before, don't belong in this book, or are written in such a subjective and convulted way that the reader has no clue what the author is trying to say...  I imagine that Thompson knocked back a few before he put his fingers to the keys, otherwise I can't imagine how one would even consider writing some of the things he does.   Furthermore, I am no prude, but Thompson's crude renderings of some of the seamier sides of business in Hollywood have no place in a book that purports to be history.  Finally, how this book escaped an editor I can't quite imagine... he makes all kinds of generalizations about inane things...  For example, the way in which lip gloss got invented (you don't want to know Thompson's "expert" theory on this).  I hate to say it, but it's not even worth the time to read it.  If you want Hollywood history, there are many other books, that are well researched, informative, and a pleasure to read.  If you want gossip, don't bother reading Thompson's bizarre and truncated renditions, try "Hollywood Babylon" and the like.  
 I didn't even need it by the time I received it.  It took that long.. 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 I picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. This is all I brought so I had to finish it. But it was a struggle.   Firstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters.   This book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. The hero is always right.   Bell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys.   Overall awful, just awful. My first and last Bell book. I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf 
 Very limited selection of music.  Not at all what I wanted or needed.  There was nothing to tell what songs were on it, so I bought it without knowing.  THAT was MY mistake 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 What a waste. Sacco could reach a much wider audience if he had written essays. But, wait...does he have the talent to write essays? Being "cool & edgy" apparently has more meaning to him than making a legitimate difference in the world, in general, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically. Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing 
 The Earth's *surface area* is nearly 70% water, but its total mass is a paltry 0.023% H20. That's hardly significant. In the human body, water is distributed differently in various areas: lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water; bood contains about 83% water; body fat contains 25% water and bone has 22% water. Total % body water also varies considerably from infancy to adulthood, between men and women, and between individuals. These things can hardly be considered "coincidence" by any stretch of the imagination. The connection between water and life is well understood, straight-forward, and ,frankly, obvious. There's no need for magical thinking, weird mysticism, or silly books (like this one) to make the point that our water supply is precious and must be protected. Only an *irrational* person would argue against that 
  POSSIBLE SPOILERS.  Well....what can I say? This is a dreary and dull film leaving no redemption or satisfaction for the main characters and the audience as well. So a young teacher gets caught with her knickers down while making "naughty, naughty" over one of her students. Common news, nowadays. The fact that she gets caught by a rather elderly and matronly teacher seeking same sex companionship is a an unfortunate coincidence. And away we go...sailing downhill waiting to hit the bottom of the barrel with remarkable success.   What's the point?   One wonders what vague period of drowsy longings gave birth to this cinematic event.   One wonders why Ms. Dench and Ms. Blanchett would even bother.   1 Star for that wonderful hairstyle Lady Judi had to endure.      
 Mack 10 is good for a laugh.these lyrics&music are played out like 5 years back.i hear Cube pulling the strings here and that's one of the reasons why he has fallen off so bad.trying to give a 3rd tier rapper 2nd  rate Rhymes.and the guests alone don't make no sense 
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, because of the made-up disease which causes her to gain weight, and failure of the character to really learn what she needs to learn from this experience, it is sort of a waste.  Could have been written better - and doesn't get to the heart of the matter 
 What a bunch of tripe!    I was prepared to read a book about the secret life of sororities only to find urban legend after urban legend printed as if it were true.  I was very disappointed.  I guess the key here is that anyone can take a bunch of urban legends, claim they followed 4 fictional people through it, and claim it was real.  Heck, maybe I should write a book.  Anyone want to hear about my four friends who picked up an exploding cactus and chihuahua while in Mexico?  It's true... really! They told me all about it 
 I've always looked upon "Christian" fiction with a rather wary eye.  It has less to do with the subject matter than the lesser quality of these works; it's as if the publishers cynically assumed that merely presenting something as "Christian" would be enough to guarantee a certain level of readership, no matter how poorly written the book is (this is often done with science fiction and fantasy as well).  Three (or more properly, Thr3e) by Ted Dekker has done little to alter my view.  (Why did I read the book?  Because when I bought it (along with another Dekker book), I didn't realize fully what I was buying.)  Three tells the story of Kevin Parson, a seminary student who suffered from a strange, semi-abusive childhood.  He gets a phone call one day warning him that unless he solves a riddle within three minutes, his car will explode.  Kevin doesn't solve the riddle and the car does blow up, but he escapes intact.  Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game with Slater, who may or may not be a serial killer named the Riddle Killer.  Slater believes that Kevin has committed a grave sin that requires confession or death.  Kevin, along with his childhood friend Samantha (now a state cop) and Jennifer Peters (an FBI agent) try and hunt down Slater, but Slater is apparently too clever to be caught easily.  There is not much that is truly Christian about this book other than a few religious lines (never getting very preachy) and the definitely PG-rated material:  the language is gentle enough, the romance is chaste and the violence is relatively bloodless.  I'm fine with all that as long as the story's good, and that's not the case here.  It's actually too bad, because Dekker seems like a decent enough plotter, but the story relies on a plot twist that is one of the most annoying in suspense fiction; I won't say what it is, but even Dekker seems a bit uncomfortable with it, as he spends a lot of time rationalizing it.  In addition, to perpetrate this twist, he has to actively deceive (not merely mislead) the reader, which is a cheat.  In addition, even though Dekker has a good sense of plot (till the end) and he is able to maintain a fast, tense pace, he is overall, just a passable writer.  I suppose technically his work is proficient, but compared to the great names in crime stories (Elmore Leonard, Michael Connelly, Lee Child, etc.), Dekker's prose is just flat.  With a two-star rating, it is not the worst book out there, but it is one to avoid. 
 Obtuse: a : lacking sharpness or quickness of sensibility or intellect : INSENSITIVE, STUPID b : difficult to comprehend : not clear or precise in thought or expression synonym see DULL. per Merriam-Webster  Having a very succesful professional sales career, spanning 21 years, I found this mini-book to be a real effort written by someone who has never been in sales.  If one was to follow these simple tidbits, they would find themself with little or no Customers at all. Customers would like to be treated as humans, not a bank of purchase orders.  The methods and "secrets" this authors portrays as effective will destroy any Customer relationship one is trying to build. It will undermine the true effectiveness a sales professional has both with the Customer and internally with the organization he/she represents. The adopter of these secrets will truly become a pain-maker to those around them.  I can only hope my competitors adopt these techniques 
 I have this book in hardback (bought 30 years ago and it is the best translation) and wanted to get one for my son, but as I couldn't find anything but paperback I ordered this one. Big disappointment. The paper is cheap and coarse, the lettering is thick and indistinct, and there are no margins. Its visually difficult and unpleasant to read. This is published by the "Signet Press", I will be avoiding their books in the future 
 I think this novel is best for younger readers.  I found it a little cheesy.  I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention.  
 I am largely disappointed with this album. Some of the reviews I have read hailed DJ Spooky's attempt to conjoin multpile genres with his expirimental style, but to me the result is an an incoherent bravado of noise. The only enjoyable tracks are those featuring guests such as Kool Kieth and Sir Menelik, but between Spooky's silly pseudo-intellectual music-science rationalizations and his overly filtered effects, it sounds less like music and more like someone having fun with a mixing board 
 Over the years I've had several toasters and all have performed acceptably but this overpriced unit is unbelieveably bad at doing the job. I tried several slices in different positions and all came out toasted on one side with virtually no browning on the other plus the left edge of all slices were burned black. Unless you want it for an "art" display in your kitchen get another brand. I'm going back to my old Cuisinart which has worked flawlessly for years 
 This book assumes a lot of time is available to teach students civilized ways of treating others.  It does not serve those of us who teach middle or high school--we generally have 45 minutes per day, are required to complete the text in one year, and have students whose attitudes and habits are almost solidified.  This book has some great ideas which may work in elementary classrooms.  If you teach adolescents, I recommend books by Lee Canter or Randall Sprick 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 It is very convenient to come up with a vague diagnosis for vague symptoms.  There is very little hard evidence to support this diagnsosis.  I am sure that there are people who are sensitive or allergic to yeast who feel much better when they avoid it.  I think the problem is that anyone who doesn't feel good has symptoms that fit into those attributed to this problem.  Testimonial benefits are worthless.  Watch late night TV for diet products, hair growth products, etc... if you doubt that.   I do agree that if we all ate a natural preservative free diet, exercised, etc.. that we'd all feel better.  I am just not ready to attribute that all to yeast hypersensitivity and the authors have very little real evidence that this condition exists or is the cause of problems for so many 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 If this had been a two-page article in The Reader's Digest, I would have skimmed it. To have paid $11 for the book was a rip off.  I have learned that:  *	People buy things on cruise ships on their own free will but perhaps they shouldn't *	That some purchases are not a good as they would like *	That some ships have mechanical breakdowns *	That tipping on some lines is mandatory even though service is not good *	That some employees do extra favors to receive better tips (for shame) *	That pictures in brochures show cabins as being more attractive than they are *	That some cruise lines use some prepared foods *	That there is some sex on cruise ships *	That there is a need for better industry and government policing of the industry *	That there are weather problems on the high seas *	That some cruise lines are better than others *	That small cabins are indeed small *	That employees work hard and that those from poor countries are willing to take jobs at pay levels higher than they could make at home and lower than in the US *	That it is good to write complaint letters if something goes wrong *	That some of the warm smiles are phony *	That a cruise ship's ambiance does not match the TV/movie version of cruising *	That sometimes it is better to tour ports without organized and expensive tours *	And that some people will do anything to write a book  If you are shocked or surprised by these issues, this is the book for you. If you are a bit more sophisticated, you might look elsewhere.  With the number of cruises the author (and his unnamed partner--this reference appears with every first person reference by the author) one would expect that not everything was perfect on every cruise. Moreover, one might expect that some cruise lines would consider the author (and his partner) a chronic complainer. I certainly do.  I have taken six cruises, and the seventh in 10 days. Sure things go wrong--and my legs hurt after a 10 K run too. My memories (and I do find faults) are superior--including going through a hurricane and being one of the only passengers with my stomach strong enough to eat.  So--will I take another cruise? Yes!! Did I find this book a rip off? YES!!!     
 If you are a rational person, you are going to balk at about 75% of this book. For instance, menstruating women aren't supposed to do clearing ceremonies. (No one bleeding can do these ceremonies.) There are other ridiculous rules and statements which are too tiresome to go into. Every once in a while, there's a helpful hint about something, and I enjoyed the bagua part (that's about placement issues), but that is not much of the book. This book is not worth your time unless you are a pretty trippy person who can suspend all logical thought for the duration of the read.. 
 I am an avid reader yet I found this book a huge disappointment.  I love EJD and met him in Nawlin's at an Essence festival and complimented his style of writing as a "breath of fresh air."  However after reading this one, I would have to retract my compliment.  I would have to agree with a couple of other readers that this isn't one of his 'best' work!  I waited for something big to happen and it never did, the only exciting part was the true identity of... Ms. Kenya.  I will continue to read EJD and I hope it gets better with time.

 Being a dog lover but not a dog owner who believes that it is cruel to keep most dogs in an urban environment, and especially a large dog in a flat as the author did, I found this memoir not to be my cup of tea.  Humans are portrayed in it as curious, rather unsympathetic creatures, whilst the dog at the center of his love, is romanticised despite the loving detail with which the author describes the bodily functions of the animal.  I can understand though, its appeal to those with an obsession with their dog who find humans too argumentative, contrary or difficult.  An instance of "horses for courses" so to speak 
 Worst movie ever the creture on the front cover is not even in the movie you do not see the monster which is a beast until the last 15 minutes...Do not waste your money on this home made movie  Please take my word for it it is that Bad...............The majority of the movie is talking....... 
 Before you vote this review down, I ask that you fully read it, so you can understand why Sin City does not function as a good film.  Sin City unfortunately is an absolute mess.  I sat down to watch this provocative disaster about a year ago, and it has stuck with me ever since.  It has lingered for so long because it is representative of everything that could possibly go wrong with a production such as this.  I am fan of Robert Rodriguez's directing. I also absolutely love everything that Quentin Tarantino has cranked out since his inception as a director.  I grew up with interest in the occasional Frank Miller graphic novel.  This is why it is so sad that Sin City fails on so many levels.  Within the first 23 minutes of watching this film, I was praying that it would be over soon.  I only stuck it out so I could one day write this review.  Let's break it down to its most basic levels.  The film has great directors, great actors, a great story, and a great production design.  With all of this going for it, one expects "Sin City" to be a landmark movie experience, and it is -- though, for me, the experience is a negative one, and the attainment it achieves is in the depths of pointless, mean-spirited exploitation.  The film tells three stories (with a fourth vignette as a framing device): Bruce Willis battling a child-molesting monster; Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk out to avenge a girlfriend's murder; and Clive Owen as a private eye helping a band of imperiled hookers.  The three segments transpire more or less in sequence (with some confusing overlapping) and all take place in Sin City: a super-corrupt, super-violent, super-shadowy, and in every other way super-exaggerated caricature of a '40s Hollywood film-noir world.  It's a caricature of a caricature.  No one would ever confuse this world with reality. The heroes shake off multiple gunshot wounds, devastating blows to the head and other lethal overtures like slaps on the cheek; the hookers all look like Victoria's Secret models; the scenes are ugly day dreams.  And, to be fair, the stylish blend of CGI- exoticism and continual chaos generates a certain visual fascination. Sin City, however, can't sustain it, and after the first segment it's hard to imagine how anyone could find its trashy excess anything but tedious, obnoxious, and repetitive.  Everything that happens in the movie is an calculated cliche. The stories have a minimal narrative drive or interest, the banter is banal pseudo-Raymond-Chandler babble and the performances are as shallow as most "SNL" skits these days.  Rodriguez is rather vain because of his pride in the way his movie so faithfully bows to the "genius" of Miller and re-creates his comic-book world with the same kind of religious devotion Gus Van Sant paid to Hitchcock with his frame-for-frame "Psycho" remake.  Is comic-book art some special invention that deserves such recognition? Aren't movies already enough like dumb comic books without actually trying to BE one?  Though it's not immediately obvious, "Sin City" is a comedy, and its aspiration is to pull off the Tarantino trick of making its audience wearily laugh at the outrageousness of its sadism at the same time it subtly gets off on it sexually.  And it's out to one-up Tarantino by basking in the pornography of brutality on a large scale, a giddy spectacular in which we sit back like Romans at the Coliseum watching people being decapitated, disemboweled, dismembered, castrated and humiliated.  Check out Fellini's Satyricon if that is what you are really after.  The publicity has made a big deal about what a "risky" commercial venture this is, and how heroic it was for Rodriguez to insist on putting Miller's name in the title and above his own in the directing credits. But this all stinks of the worst Hollywood insincerity.  For one thing, can anyone doubt that such a violent, low-budget movie with such a lineup of stars will make a ton of money? Given the distance "Sin City" pushes the envelope to on sick movie violence, and given the recent Columbine-like massacres, such a backlash from the Christian right and other voices for movie censorship seems likely (and Rodriguez may even be hoping for it).  I don't support these voices for a minute: I don't believe in censorship and I don't think movies motivate mass murder. But I do think that a film like this, especially one made by a major director under the flag of artistic integrity, adds something ugly to the air for which critics must hold it accountable.  Sitting through the thing, watching scene after scene in which I was being asked to be entertained by the spectacle of helpless people being tortured, I kept thinking of all the other horrible acts that are being committed today and how we, as an American society are taught to think that it is all so gruesome and atrocious.  I suppose some people don't find it that bad. "Sin City" is their movie. 
 If you don't "Memorize" Chapter 1 and 2 It is impossible to understand this book. I realy did not like his approach. I prefer people explain to me and understand the example instead of forcing us to memorize. If you are software Quality Engineer and tester  and if you think you can use example of this book to devlope test script, forget this book. it is useless without memorizing above listed chapter 
 John Irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors, in spite of, not because of this book.  After reading Garp, Cider House, and a few others, perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text.   Many of the classic `Irving' traits (sub-plots, interior dialogue, overt sexuality) encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing.  Even at the conclusion of the story I could not make myself care for or truly understand Dr. Daruwalla (protagonist).  After 700-something odd pages, (usually an aspect of Irving's style that I appreciate and embrace), I was ready for the novel to end.  And it did, rather expectedly and unceremoniously.  This is not to say that the novel should not be read, it was mildly enjoyable (perhaps because I read the majority of it on the beach), but as for John Irving's potential, it pales in comparison to `his greats'.  Hesitantly recommended for the veteran Irving reader is the best rating I can give this book.  
 I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast 
 Great game with four players, quick and decisive. Close games are common. Beats the pants off the board game, while keeping the overall feel of that familiar game. Easy to teach to others. Game feels forced (extra rules) with more than 4, and boring with less 
 Three reasons why I will not touch any Corsair USB memory drive again:  1) As the other reviewer pointed out (4 gig) "The wide, thick rubber gasket surround the USB connector limits how far you can insert the connector into even lightly recessed USB receptacles". I thought it was just mine! There is not enough metal exposed so it means the drive frequently disconnects, loosing valuable data in the process and crashing the PC often.  2) Right from day one, the drive would show up as a USB Hub (I think it uses this to control 4 chips inside instead of a single chip). But this would at least 50% of the time cause any other device to be inserted into the same USB port on removing the memory drive not to be recognized - only a reboot would fix this. I tried this on many laptops/desktops and got the same results.  3) I contacted Corsair who said to ship it back to them even though the local retailer would take it back. Since I was out the country I told them I was uncomfortable posting it internationally (back to them in Fremont, CA) using ordinary post (courier would have been 50% of what I could buy it new for). But they pushed for this without offering to pay for the post so ordinary post it went. They now claim not to have received it and now unlike the other reviewer I do not even have own a $100 paper weight.  I'd like to say a lot of other things, but fear that Amazon will not print it, so lets leave it at the simple facts above. I don't think I have been so disgusted at a company of peripherals as much as Corsair. And for Corsair to validate what I have said is true, my RMA Number: R15300 
 I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and "hope" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters 
 I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store. 
 I was extrememly dissapointed by this novel. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys when they finally caught the good guy! The plot had potential -- US & Chinese politics, WMDs, a Mideast connection, etc., but the characters are really hard to believe. It seems like the bad guys are everywhere, watching everything, and only the hero is clueless. Narrow escape after narrow escape, the reader isn't inspired by the hero's dedication, instead, you are left stunned by his stupidity.  If you are a Ludlum fan, pass this one up. There are better choices. 
 This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to "make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse".  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  "transsexual shoe shop".  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option 
 This is all we need - yet another book telling us how great we Scots are. Recently, we've had Hermann's "How the Scots Invented the Modern World," Buchan's "Capital of the Mind: How Edinburgh Changed the World," and Lamont's "When Scotland Ruled the World: The Story of the Golden Age of Genius, Creativity and Exploration." Enough already!!!  This pathological need to hear our praises continually sung and to have the sound of our backs being patted forever ringing in our ears is pathetic. Bruce's new book takes this national self-obsession mania to new heights by taking a leaf out of the Scottish Rugby Association's book and granting Scottishness to anyone even remotely related, cobber. Thus we are told to our eternal and insufferable conceit that a fat American pill popper and donut chomper who had a few hits with cover versions was ... gasp! ... Scottish, because his name was Presley. "Awl-right!!!" as Neil Kinnock (another great ersatz Scot) once proclaimed. Oh, and while you're going on about Neil Armstrong of the famous Borders name, what about Louis Armstrong? Or Diana Ross for that matter!?   Instead of burying their noses in a badly compressed pile of laurels, Scots should sit up and look around at their garbage infested streets, grafitti disfigured walls; the constant vandalism, drunkeness, and violence that make their living environment intolerable; and the cozy political cronyism, high taxes, and public service inefficiency that make all these pats on the back sound so damnably hollow.   Scots might have once made a mark in the world, but now Scotland's just a land of obese, junkie, drunken neds, who cannae e'en kick a ba', and their dysfunctional parents and siblings. Pride doesn't even enter into it anymore.   
 I adore Bach.  I was intrigued by the enigma of Glenn Gould.  Having heard the Goldberg Variations by a number of lesser talents both on piano and harpsichord i thought it was time for me to finally shell out on what I've been frequently assured is the definitive reading of the variations.  I find I've spent £14 on some decent Bach with some tramp muttering and whining in the background!!  It's not easy to ignore - in fact its impossible to ignore - and totally destroys the pleasure of listening to the music.  I would no accept any musician destroying a piece of music by singing - in an entirely different key - along as being acceptable, regardlss of his reputation.  What we have here is Shine syndrome.  David Helfgott could not play.  He was very strange so we sat with indulgent smiles, patronising this poor lost soul, whilst he strangled numerous pieces.  Similarly we find a poor Bach recording with a deranged individual ruining the recording by constant muttering and humming lauded as a classic.  I look forward to ecsatic reviews for other pieces destroyed by extraneous noise.  A La Boheme with jet engine.  Some Messien with added car alarm noises.  Mozart with a crank caller dubbed on.  If you gave this five stars you're rewarding a reputation and haven't listened to the music at all 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 Without playing too much to the author's obvious biases, I can only say he has wrought a finely detailed purse from a sow's ear. But it still remains a sow's ear.   Lieven is anti-American. But, for what good reason? Really none. He has a cultural/historical grudge and axe to grind as he projects much of his own country's history on its long departed sibling, America. This grudge has, of course, been held because America has done so very well without the English. If anyone has an imperialist attitude, it is Lieven and his countrymen. The English have characterized Americans as rude, coarse savages, as were the Australians -- the latter perhaps the preeminent example of land clearing for the imperial cause, if there ever were one. One need only speak to the English about President George W. Bush, and it becomes clear they believe him to be a stupid cowboy in the most stereotypical way.   While Lievan poses Americans as Jacksonian oppressors clearing the land of savages, it has historically been the British who have colonized and exploited so-called savage lands they could rape for England's gain. This cannot be entirely said for America, except with respect for the American Indian and African slave.   Clearly, the English colonists were in America to exploit the lands and peoples. But for many other settlers the former problem was, arguably, not so much the conquering of distant lands for personal gain as it was one of ineptitude. Many American settlers did not foresee the hostility of indigenous peoples. Faced with the proposition of life and death, settlers felt compelled to defend their property -- even more, to defend the land that stood breach between sustenance and starvation. Slavery cannot be so explained.  Contrary to Lieven's oversimplified thesis, America has been host to the many masses of people's from distant lands. Rather than clear its land of savages, some observors would surely say America has filled its land with such so-called savages. Indeed, the melting pot never was and never will be. In that respect America is more like France in that through its benificence the door has been opened to a host of problems.   The question now is how America will deal with rapidly encroaching Islamists and Islam itself, the breeding ground from which such extremists spring. The same cannot be said for Christianity. While Islam promotes offensive warfare and the capturing of slaves, Christianity promotes peace and the sane acceptance of one's plight, should it be as slave.   France dealt with the Muslims with a light hand and is now a nation filled with fuming Islamic discontents rioting in the streets and burning thousands upon thousands of vehicles, damaging private property and otherwise undermining the rule of law. One might ask, "Are they savages?" Well, not neccessarilly so. But many hold values that are destructive to the very fabric of a nation. We can trace such failures back to, at least, Algeria. Should America allow itself to become another France? We have opened the floodgates. How should we close them 
 Well, I'm done.  I made it a little ways into Pillars, and decided my time with Terry Goodkind is at an end.  I was very taken with Wizard's First Rule; it was a great fantasy work, and I was thrilled with having added it to my collection.  But from there, the story just became dull, pointless, and frankly, just too predictable.  Referring to the series as a story can only be done loosely, though.  The series has actually struck me more as a series of short story novels, sharing main characters and some themes.  Up to this point, the stories have followed a very basic, repetitive outline:  Richard and Kahlan are happy together. Richard and Kahlan get separated, seemingly forever. Richard must endure trials and hardship to hope to return to Kahlan. Kahlan must endure trials and hardship to hope to return to Richard. They both learn important lessons about themselves and humanity. They are reunited, with much rejoicing.  But now Pillars of Creation comes along...  and while I was never overly-taken with the template Goodkind was using (refer to the above story skeleton and fill in the details with whatever philosophic point Goodkind is trying to make this go around), at least the plotlines revolved around characters I had somewhat gotten to know.    No longer the case, unfortunately.  About 100 pages in, I closed the book, put the dust jacket back on, and put it back on the shelf.  I may pick it up again somewhere down the road, or I may just offload that shelf of books to the local used book shop.  Or I may re-read the first six books with a highlighter and note all the Robert Jordan similarities.  I may need two highlighters...  I think it's time to re-read Martin and get back to what I enjoy about Fantasy 
 Professor Shaw is certainly not starved for thoroughness in presenting the rise and fall of the Ottoman state. But what this text boils down to is something that Herman Melville would have penned had he been a scholar in Turkish history. Piling on fact after fact after fact is not conducive to a worthwhile learning experience. You would need more than two hands to count how many times I flung this text against the wall, and I consider myself to be *very* patient. Luckily, there are alternatives available. Halil Inalcik does a much more lucid job--his book is the one to get 
 not my favorite of their products. The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt, it takes to long to soften. 
 This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it 
 After you strip away that which is intuitively obvious...there's not much here. There are some betting strategies if you're the type to bet $300 on a Pick 3 or $2,500 on a Pick 6. Otherwise, I'd give this book a miss 
 Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:  1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.  2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.  I will have to return it 
 The one star I gave this schlock is for the readability of the prose. At least that has substance.  As for the actual content . . . Take Marxist revolutionary theory, give it a plot and a timeline, and you have this book. The author actually used the word "bourgeoisie" as a prosaic tool. Bourgeoisie? Please.  Granted it was written some 15 years ago, before the events of 1989-90 played themselves out.  Still, the fact that this howler wasn't immediately recalled en masse is illustrative.  Don't waste your money 
 VERBOSITY, n. the employment of a superabundance of words; the use of more words than are necessary  This probably describes all this author's works. I had a terrible time wading through his bio on W.C. Fields and had to skip over most of it. I disposed of that book as soon as I was finished with it. When I got this book out of the library I had fogotten all about the author. But when I started reading "Stan and Ollie" I quickly looked at the cover and cried, "oh, no!."  I made it through almost three chapters before giving up.  Yet, I am a person who loves to read how an author weaves words together. That is part of the pleasure of a book. But this author doesn't weave, he just pours!  This book could be a third of its length and do its subjects far better justic 
 I really didn't enjoy this book. It was very basic, informal, and short. It didn't teach me anything that you or I couldn't of came up with. Basically, all the author tells you to do is do your homework, go to class, and pick a major that isn't Economics. The book didn't have any "secrets" about getting As in college 
 A very disappointing read-laborious, predictable, no interesting plot or characterization. The supporting characters that make Eve such an interesting person and the books such fascinating reads were missing--for a book set during Christmas, this lack was even more apparent. I am a huge fan of this series, and this book was the first that felt like a huge waste of my money. I will wait for the paperback version of the next In Death offering 
 Not one of Laymon's best efforts!  It's difficult to care about the "live" characters and the "resurrectees" are a joke!  I have enjoyed the other Laymon books I've read, but this one is a stinker! I give this book 2 stars only because even at his less than best, he still writes a readable book.  If you have never read Laymon don't start with this one 
 All I could think was, "Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed." I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. I only ended up feeling more depressed. As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.   If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well 
 This is a bad, bad, bad, bad book.  It isn't about how to write stories - it's a motivation book.   It's also a commiserating companion for the struggling writer who can't come up with anything and doesn't know why.  This book is a perfect example of what's wrong with most writing books out there.    Sound harsh?  Well, maybe.  But a book on writing should teach one how to write a decent story - not push tired, pseudo-mystical ideas like:  "the story just sort of takes shape on its own".  This isn't any help.  In fact, it's worse than "no help" - it's hurtful because it encourages an aspiring writer to stay ignorant of the craft - the CRAFT - of storytelling.    Stephen Koch clearly doesn't understand what makes a good story , or how a good story is written.  His advice is ludicrous, amounting to gems like: "Stories make themselves known, they reveal themselves - even to their tellers - only by being told.  You may ask how on earth you can tell a story before you know it.  You do that by letting the emerging story tell itself through you."  What a bunch of malarkey!  To claim that a that a story exists "somewhere" and all the writer has to do is "find it" is probably the stupidest thing I've read.  It's like saying a sculpture exists and the welder just has to find it.  Or that the painted masterpiece is already painted - you just have to let it come through you.    Nonsense.  A story doesn't exist until someone CREATES it.  And Stephen Koch either doesn't know that, or doesn't know how one creates a story.  His advice "let the story tell itself through you" is very, very bad.  Would you tell an aspiring cabinet-maker to "just let the cabinet come THROUGH you?"  No!  The guy would probably make the ugliest cabinet ever.  Either that or he would saw his fingers off because he didn't know what he was doing.  He would waste time, effort, and money - which is what YOU'LL do if you buy this book.    Now I recognize that storytelling is a tad different from cabinetmaking.  But they both have principles one must follow in order to succeed.  A good cabinet must be balanced, sturdy, and square.  A good story must have characters, conflict, and ultimately show us something universal about life in an emotional way.   What's more, Stephen Koch's advice is really nothing more than a collection of tired advice from writers more successful than him.  He quotes Stephen King and Ray Bradbury frequently, as well as just about any other big-name writer he can, whenever they have a quote he can lift and use to support his view.  It's hard to say if he's learned anything on his own, or is just parroting advice he's read in other books.    Also - This book is called "The Modern Library Writer's Workshop" but you'll find nothing at all like a workshop, unless you count the occasional gripe from a struggling writer.  There is VERY little craft mentioned in here, and most everything Koch talks about is in vague generalities.  Most workshops would have you do exercises or assignments.  Not here.  That's fine, but one of the best ways to get someone writing is to give them a push in the right direction.  Beginning books on woodworking (sorry for the continued comparison) often give the plans for a small box or stool that the beginner can hone his skills on before moving on to complicated pieces of furniture.   It stands to reason that a writer might be better off trying to write short stories before he or she tries to tackle a novel.  But Koch has no such advice.    In conclusion, stay far, far away from this book.  I bought it on a whim because I didn't have enough time or opportunity to really look at it.  But I'm sorry I bought it now.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  
 My husband has a theory that Danielle Steel has a dart board and each circle surrounding the center is labeled either, falls in love, loses family member, has death of loved-one,fights for life of herself or loved one, loses partner,business or spouse. He feels when she is at a loss she justs throws off a dart and whatever she hits becomes the outline for her next book.  I have been a loyal fan for many many years and take his kidding with a smile and secretly pray he's not right.  This book proved me wrong and he was right all these years. It was so obvious from the first few pages what was happening that I was certain I had read this story before somewhere. After having waited  long time to get this book from my local library I was so disappointed that it was so poorly written and so badly not thought through I couldn't even read it completely, but skipped sections to finish it, knowing what was going to happen before I got to it.   
 Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of "local legends" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question 
 This is a great book, but it is just stretched  way too long. It starts out great and keeps the reader glued to the pages. Then the book starts to end the same things happen over and over again and you just think when id this book going to end. Personaly i think this book could have ended about 50 pages befor it did. I think the book would have had a shot at the Newbery if it didn't go on as long as it di. That just goes to show that you cant hve a super-de-duper start but then your ending just really stinks your book wont be that good. You need to have a good ending and a good begining in order to have a good book 
 While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it.  I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed "meat" analogs.  I very rarely use this book for this reason.  That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section.  So, if you don't mind the vegetarian "meat," you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, "the Soy of Cooking," which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than "meat. 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Only read the first chapter... Sorry. As people criticize China without being there, I guess I have the right to criticize this book without reading it entirely. So I guess this is just another book about how China wants to conquer the world. Unfortunately, this is not the only one. Let's review the first chapter very quickly. It is beginning with US-(NATO) bombing of China's ambassy in 1999...Mmmmh...Let me see... Where is the threat ? Ah and China was focusing its anger against US through their media (May be a Chinese Foxnews?). Really strange these Chinese people. Then it continues with the China's Communist plan where we have details about how US is spying China's airwaves.   I am wondering if the author has ever been to China or if he only relies on "intelligence" reports ? (May the same guys that found WMD in Irak ?).Unfortunately, this book is not available in eBook version, it seemed pretty funny 
 I bought this for the version of 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' included in it.  Olivier is excellent as Big Daddy, and Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner are very good as well.  The photography and sets on these plays are reminiscent of a mid-seventies soap opera;  fairly cheesy sets, glarey lighting.  That would be tolerable, but the sound is recorded so muddily that it's really hard to understand the actors-so much so that I haven't been able to finish some of the plays.  I can't believe that the DVD producers couldn't have spruced up the sound.  If they can reissue CDs of Caruso and McCormack with listenable sound, surely they could have restored this soundtrack to some degree of clarity.  What makes it even worse is that they don't include subtitles on the DVD.  Hey, producers, a play is all about the WORDS, ya know?  They're important, and if they aren't accessible through the soundtrack you might consider subtitles.  Given that you can't understand half of what's said, I see no reason for anyone to ever buy this item.  It's sad, because there seems to be some pretty good acting in these plays 
 It reminded me of when I got mud in my mouth, while playing diggers in the garden as a child! Sorry but this wasn't for me I'm affaid.  The water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy' 
 This was the last Sedaris book I read, and I guess I was just spoiled by his other works.  Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.  His fictional offerings are a bit useless.  The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality.  When this translates to fiction it loses its validity.  There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism.  Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.  The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction.  Go read "Naked" or "Dress Your Family in Cordury and Denim".  His later works are far superior to this 
 This shonky production gives a new dimension to the term 'exploitation'. The DVD cover lists the running time as 85 minutes. It isn't. The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace 
 Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes.  This book is a joke.  Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this.  Heart attack city!  Oh, and crappy food.  Did I mention how bad her recipes are?  Terrible.  The scourge must be stopped!  Whoot 
 I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong.   I will simply list the things I do not like: 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller. 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 Stuart Gordon is perhaps most famous for his skilled adaptation of Lovecraft's story, "Re-Animator."  That movie is an excellent example of how mordantly dark comedy and horror can be blended into a fine cinematic concoction.  Most recently, however, Gordon put "Edmond," a Mamet play, on the big screen, and the result was a jumbled sociological treatise without brains, a tapestry of symbols without referrents.  Basically, bad filmmaking.  He directed this installment of the Showtime series at around the same time with almost exactly the same results.  "Dreams" is another Lovecraft tale, this time about a physics student named Walter Gilman (Ezra Godden, who was also in Gordon's "Dagon").  Being a typically-poor graduate student, Walter moves into a squalid attic apartment and finds himself plagued by horrible dreams, dark premonitions, and a rat with a human face.  Fans of Lovecraft and Gordon may defend this short film (and it seems many have), but if you don't have a prefabricated love for the story or its director, I'm afraid the only thing to like here is Godden's head's-first portrayal of Walter (and, for those with prurient tastes, some full-frontal witch nudity).  Everything else -- the mood, the directing, the production values, the dialogue -- it's all abysmally bad, watered-down and uninspired.  The story, altered to suit time (and perhaps monetary) constraints, is an unconvincing mess.  It's hard to pin-point why, exactly.  It might be the preponderance of stock characters, or it might be the laughable effects (the several close-ups of the man-rat made me wonder if I wasn't watching a comedy).  Whatever it is, it definitely has something to do with the story-telling.  The plot crumbles as it lengthens, fumbling frantically for some degree of menace but coming up, instead, with handfuls of foolishness.  Ultimately, "Dreams" makes about as much sense as an actual dream and is just as substantial.  You'd probably be better entertained if you just took a nap 
 I didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.   I have many of her videos and I'm a true fan of hers 
 Ian Curtis plunges into the depths of post-existential, post-structural connotative ruminations on the implications of our "thrown-ness" (as Heidegger put it) into this world, into its light, its darkness, and the transluscent twilight of the ambiguity we confront as we try to choose between good and evil with nothing to guide us beyond the pull of our compulsive pusilanimity.  Curtis's inept baritone proves the perfect counterpoise for Joy Division's disinterested, motoric rhythms and the barely competent guitar of whatsisname.  All in all, an album for the ages.  The early middle ages, to be precise, during the last few years of Pepin the Short's reign.   More than any band I can think of, Joy Division makes it plain that it's virtually impossible to underestimate the intelligence, or overestimate the gullibility, of Western Man.  There's no arguing about individual taste, or one's ability to perceive the paradox of beauty in ugliness, or any subjective point of view when it comes to this band.  Joy Division is objectively crap.  Musically, lyrically, conceptually, aesthetically, even the production blows.  In 35 years of obsessive record collecting, I've never seen any band even come close to Joy Division when it comes to pulling the wool over peoples' eyes.  Come to think of it, why do you think you never see Ian Curtis and Karl Rove photographed together? 
 I give this book 2 stars for the occasional first person insights into the Doors. But there is too little of it. There is too much of the rantings of a man who is apparently trapped in the 6os, and is undergoing a personal mind battle between himself as a flower child and a business man. He often comes on as one or the other of these two conflicting images.  Often he rants about the establishment and their love of power and money, but at the same time he exudes great excitement when he describes the business and money aspect of his music career; like the big bucks he got when 'Light my Fire' hit the charts and the new car and beach house he was able to then buy. Or when he describes getting his first royalty check from Elektra and "Grinning and Dithering" while he makes his wife guess at the figure. Then she "squeals" and they hug and yell "We're rich!" A few pages later he goes on ranting about power and money hungry people.  I found too much hypocrisy in his writing like when he keeps using the phrase "I hope the lovers win the war. Don't you?" Then a few pages later he comes on as anything but a lover with his nasty second-hand gossip about Morrison allegedly telling him that he didn't like John Desmore. Uh, wouldn't a true lover and person who preaches peace and goodwill amongst each other, have kept that to himself rather than basically telling the world "Jim liked me more than John." I mean, what does that serve other than hurting another man's feelings? Nasty stuff from a self professed lover of people.  "Break On Through" is a much more supperior book on this topic. And it is a shame. Because with Manzarek's personal insight into the group, he could have provided the greatest story....But instead he chose to hog the spotlight and put too much of himself, his hypocritical pseudo hippy rantings, and his mean spirited jabs at others who were a part of this chapter in his life, into this book. I was hoping for more. Instead he delivered mostly junk 
 This book is well written, but is severely biased towards conventional American medical practises. The author has no understanding or experience with the different types of medicine he describes, and has very little understanding of the healing process and how to work with it. Read it but be very cautious of his bias 
 This is a reasonably fun light read which would have improved if it had been edited.  As with many American popular science books, the first third is perhaps worth reading if you're fast, the second third is barely OK, and the last third seems to have gone directly from a first draft written in a word processor to the printed page.   The premise is entertaining- that human intelligence might have evolved as a sexual display - but it's not well supported by evidence. To be fair, the author points this out occasionally in the first third of the book.   I only save books I might like to read or refer to again. This one ended up directly in the wastebasket. 
 I just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition.  However, after setting it up, I added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water.  No cascading sound.  I added more water -- nothing... I added less water -- absolutely nothing.  The design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise.  It is useless from that perspective... plus, you can tell it is made of plastic so it isn't really that nice to look at either.  I would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This book is simply unfortunate. Firstly, if this book is the first book you have read by this author, and if you are so disappointed by it that you do not want to read any of his other work you will be doing yourself a grave disservice. When Coelho writes from his heart and not his vanity he is an amazing storyteller. Thus, this book is not representative of some of his previous work, which is quite excellent. With this book it seemed that he felt that people love his books so much that they would also love reading about his process in writing his books, and not just that he uses the book as an autobiographical tale. Major problems for me with this book were that clearly the author and the main male character are one in the same. Coelho never admits this, but he has flagrantly made the character so similar to himself that it is insanely ridiculous that he is not recognizing this as an autobiography of some sort. Secondly, the characters are dreadfully and tediously boring, and mentioning the Eiffel tower, his success, fame, money, loyal readership, and open marriage a gazillion times doesn't change this fact. Thirdly, he somehow has convinced himself that breaking up with someone that you have spent a decade of your life with, and then thinking about them and missing them is obsessive instead of a natural part of grieving a broken heart, this makes the whole zahir story line quite ridiculous. Fourth, what has come across as bits of insightful wisdom in his other books seem forced and contrived in this story, because everything else in the book is so ludricrous. Lastly, the story of his missing/runaway wife made no sense to me, and no matter how much I tried to sympathize with something in the storyline I was not able to. If you are interested in knowing many details, however boring they may be, about the author's life this book will fulfill what you are looking for. Otherwise, I agree that it really is something to be borrowed, because paying for this book would be a sad waste of money, and you would already be wasting your time by reading it. Why waste both 
 I have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 1/2 years, every one of them has had the same problems.  Trouble reading dvds, dvds skipping, discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units.  The price is right on the unit, but not for the time it worked.  I would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem.  If I could give it less than 1 star I would because thats really what it is worth, nothing 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 I had been looking forward to reading this book. First of all, I do believe that the HSP trait is a distinguishable trait. I myself have started to discover and do some research into the subject. I have no doubt that Dr. Elaine Aron is an HSP herself and her book has helped many. Maybe I was born too late or something or just my natural tendency to not put too much value into self-help books in general. Maybe it's a GenX thing, I don't know... but I think the root of it may be my general disdain for the psych "establishment" as it exists right now. They have pretentions of "open mindedness" but I really do believe a great majority of them have this "happy psychologically well-rounded medium" that they ALL seem to want to drive people toward, regardless of how many paths there are up that mountain to get to that point. I fear Ms. Aron, with her PhD credentials, has fallen into this trap of not being able to think outside the "psych box", so to speak. My biggest complaints about this book are:  1. her dismissal of the word "shy" and "shyness in general". (see below) 2. her over-insistance on psychotherapy as the cure of everything.  3, her over-reliance on childhood experiences as the ultimate factor in just about everything related to HSPness. A side note to this complaint is she seems to think childhood experience is at one of two extremes: either blissfully wonderful and magical in every way or horribly dysfunctional and wracked with trauma and just plain awful in every which way (of course requiring years of psychotherapy to get over!--sorry, I can't help being sarcastic!). I would think that most people's childhoods, whether they are HSP or not, would fall somewhere in middle, don't you think? That would be where mine falls.  4. Generational and socioeconomic complaints: This book, like many other self-help books of this type seem always geared toward overly-affluent suburban Baby Boomers. As a struggling GenXer male who hasn't had a six-figure income to escape from and find out that life is more important than making money, (sorry, sarcasm is too ingrained...it's a GenX thing!)I just feel so disconnected to this type of thinking that prevails in most self-help books of this type (which is why I mostly avoid them!) Aren't there HSPs who AREN'T age 45-60 females from New York or San Francisco?(where this author divides her time) out there who have a perspective to say? (Hmmm, maybe I should write it myself!)  I'll address these complaints briefly in depth. As someone who has both been called "shy" and have called myself that for as long as I can remember, I have no problem with the label. Granted, we should not let our labels BECOME us, but if there's something that fits and is not derogatory, why not? Frankly, what's wrong with "shy", Ms. Aron? I respect your view on it, but I disagree. I don't think "shy" is an inherently negative description. I'm mystified as to why you think every introvert should shed it.   I guess I wish this book had been written by an HSP layperson instead of a clinical psychotherapist who is stuck inside the box of that school of thought. That would make it seem more like it was written by a friend and not a shrink who has to keep their occupational distance from you. This is a highly emotional (and sensitive!) subject for us HSPers, so I dunno...maybe my response is just a natural reaction of my type. Who knows? Psychology is an inexact science to begin with, anyway.  So basically, it was a frustrating disappointment to read this book. I'm giving it two stars only because it at least was groundbreaking in it was apparently the first book to try to identify and distiguish this specific trait. It deserves credit for that at least.  
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 The CD doesn't include the software that it says it does.  You have to hunt in the book to find the information that the software included is TRIAL versions only (you can get full versions for a "nominal" fee).  It says it includes excel and excel documents which are simply NOT present on the CD.  DO NOT BUY 
 I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters. 
 Excellent book.  Gives background information about a heart healthy diet and some excellent recipes.  I love it 
 After the success of Kamikaze, many diehard Twista fans accused him of having sold out, because it wasn't until he hit the mainstream that he started seeing platinum sales. Love it or hate it, Twista tried to continue that essence with his follow-up, The Day After. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work as well.  Most of the other two-star reviews are pretty accurate (especially Constant and Norris' respective reviews). I think it can be assumed that the day after is Women's Day because Twista is spending most of the album rapping to the ladies (LL Cool J, anyone?). Not only that, but in some places it's a little too obvious that he's trying to recapture the magic of "Slow Jamz". The lead single "Girl Tonite" is the most obvious example of this, especially since Twist is once again naming balladeers and their respective songs. Also, am I the only one to find it a little odd that Twista says "When I touch her, she like" and then TREY says "Oh"? (Think about it a minute.) Another example is an obligatory Neptunes track called "Lavish", where Twista proves that he can't always rap over a slow beat.  Yet another song for the ladies that fails is "So Lonely" featuring Mariah Carey. I don't know what's up with Mimi's voice on the song, but she kind of sounds like a wannabe version of herself. Speaking of weird hooks, "Had to Call" features a chorus sung by somebody named Sleepy Eyed Jones, and he sounds like, well, it's kind of like the equivalent to how DJ Premier would sound if he tried to sing.  There are also some songs that badly use samples, especially the aptly titled "Do Wrong" (with Lil' Kim), which borrows a sample from Al Green's "Love & Happiness". And "I'm a Winner" terribly samples R. Kelly's "One Me", and if that's not bad enough, Twista is even repeating some of the lines he used in "Girl Tonite". But things aren't much better when he's NOT kickin' it to the females: the title track doesn't go anywhere, and Syleena Johnson's hook adds nothing to the song. "Heartbeat" is a little too violent (especially because the song opens with a long round of shots), and "Check That H*" has a wack chorus. And "Holding Down the Game" is a bling-blingin' song that is unnecessarily screwed and chopped in the middle of it -- and anyway, if you wanted to hear someone rapping slowly, you wouldn't pick up a Twista album, would you?  The only song really worth hearing on the whole album is "Get It How You Live". It's nice that Twista is still trying to do his thing, but I heard this album one day last week and then I had no desire to listen to it again the day after.  Anthony Ruper 
 Several years ago, I heard Mr. Weihenmayer give a motivational speech and he seemed like a very interesting guy. I picked this book up because I thought it might a continuation of his "Touch The Top Of The World" book, which I thought was pretty well done. I've worked with blind skiers before. I've also done a bit of climbing (not anything close to world class peaks)so the double connections (blind people doing hard things and climbing) attracted me. So...I bought the book. Apparently, Mr. Weihenmayer got hooked up somehow with those who are selling a "theory" about adversity (the AQ). That was a mistake my climbing friend! The whole AQ thing is really pretty silly. It's not a theory at all---just a string of homespun homilies designed to(try to) help others deal with what life brings and, of course, hopefully sell books and speeches. To call it "landmark research" or even plain old research is simply not true. There are a good number of interesting and helpful self-help books out there. Some of them are direct and honest---the author or authors simply suggest that they believe certain things to be true and they are writing them down for everyone's consideration. Others are actually real science...the author or authors of those books are careful in their claims and objective in approach. Nothing is being "sold" in those books. This book, however, mixes those two things up and pop psychology is presented as science. Not a good approach!!!!!! 
 I tried it and I didn't like it.  I'd almost say read my review of the X-files 9th season and just replace any character names and whatnot, but I won't.  As another reviewer stated this show should've ended after seven years.  Through the show's seven year run they had a cohesive  story that kept me coming back every week.  The ga'uld were an origional idea for a villian.  Apothis and Anubis being of course the stand outs.  I still think they should've had a bigger story involving so'car rather then just an episode or two.  Starting with their decision to make the lost city an ancient outpost and put Jack as a general the show just lost everything.  As boring as season 8 was it was still better than this.  When will TV executives get it?  End a show while it's still strong.  Unfortunately they love to milk a show for everything they can get.  I'd like to say props to scifi for canceling it, but they should've done that two years ago.  Of course Jack isn't on this season which adds to the crap that is season nine.  Add in some bad new characters, one of whom tries hard to be Jack it's not even funny, and a rediculous new villian and you have the makings of bad tv.  If they wanted to do this crap they should've created another bad spin off.  I wouldn't of watched it, but a lot of people would.  Oh and that's another thing, what's with all the atlantis references?  I personally don't care what goes on in another galexy on another bad tv show.  The writting has completely gone downhill.  I never finnished the memory altering device episode because ten minutes into it I figured everything except for who killed the girl, and I just don't care.  And what's with having another villian who pose as gods?  If you're going to create a new bad guy at least make them completely different.  Course the main bad guys on atlantis are basically vampires who liik like marolyn manson.  I could go on, but instead I'll just say if you haven't seen this season then just don't bother.  It's not SG1.  You can't take away three main characters over a couple year span, then take away your main bad guy, replace them with lame characters and expect it to work.  It just doesn't 
 I had much anticipation of Butler's _Precarious Lives_ considering her position as one of the foremost cultural and literary theorists.  However, I was highly disappointed that the arguments she makes in the text are no greater than those of most academics, including those of grad students.  I'd wait for the paperback edition and buy it used as it is somewhat useful for citations.  Other than that, the argument is really over-stated these days and seems like much less than what one could or "should" expect from Butler 
 I have been a food addict for years now, and I was looking for a step-by-step recovery plan to help me.  This book is terrible and the suggestions are completely ridiculous.  For example, Kay Sheppard says not to use iodized salt because it contains sugar.  This is blatantly untrue--check the label of any salt container yourself.  Furthermore, her "abstinent" meal plan recipes include potato salad and blueberry muffins--total binge foods for just about anyone 
 I just finished reading the original unabridged version of this book, in  French, and believe me, I was moved.  So when my wife and I wanted to get  an abridged version for her to read in English, we bought this one.  On  skimming through the book, and maybe it's just us, but we found no trace of  Fantine's story before she ended up in Jean Valjean's care, or of Jean  Valjean's rescue of Cosette from the Thénardiers, which are both very  moving parts.  If those are missing, there are probably other very touching  and important parts missing.  We plan on taking our version back and  getting the full version.  It would be better to just skip past the  sections that talk about the convent, the battle of Waterloo, the sewer  system, etc., because they're wasy to skip, and the rest of the book will  still be there.  Honestly, Les Mis is probably the best book I've ever  read, but it has to be purchased in it's full format to really be truly  appreciated 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but I'm sorry to say, this book really isn't one of his best. It's awfully boring and the characters really aren't very interesting. I've had a hard time even finishing it. Usually, I can't stand to put one of his books down!  For action adventure, I'd suggest reading any of his books with (one of his best characters) Alex Cross in them, or When The Wind Blows and continuation of this story with The Lake House. Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas for a really great, touching story too. Everyone who I've lent it too loves it 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 I just wish there was a way to get reviews on textbooks.  I previewed several books ultimately deciding on this text.  Do yourself a favor if you are a teacher and don't touch this book.  The information is presented in the most dull way and further everything is DATED.  I have never become so frustrated with a text that discusses current race relations with data from the 1980's.  If you are considering this text, just glance at some of the data and you will get my point.  
 these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought. I did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality. They also feel like they are made of cheap plastic. Definently not worth the $15 i paided for them 
 Why would someone buy a book that actually tries to ruin the surprises in one of the best series in literature?  I mean, PAY for this?  It would be one thing to post them online.  JK Rowling is a brilliant writer, and I am much more looking forward to seeing what she is actually setting up than have someone guess 
 this author has a bunch of friends that have given her good reviews - don't buy this book based on these misleading tactic 
 This book has zero usability.  It is not an adequate source of reference for any course pertaining to transport phenomena.  You would have better luck using the internet to help you get past advanced problems with which you struggle, as this book is poorly  organized and has little to offer to the student of any course beyond the introductory level 
 John Hodgeman is great when he's on the Jon Stewart show.  The book, sadly,  is boring even as bathroom reading 
 We have been using this mill for about 4 months, and it looks great on the table, but that's about it.  It will grind pepper, but adjusting it is very hit-and-miss (mostly miss), and it won't hold an adjustment very well.  On a fine setting, it works OK, but it is nearly impossible to get a coarse grind out of it - it seems to go from fine to medium, and then to too open to grind at all.  We got better results out of a 20-year old no-name pepper mill.  I would not buy this mill again 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another "Memoirs of a Geisha" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the "Changeling") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock.  With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again. 
 I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minute 
 As a person who scarcely gets much national news, I was able during the aftermath of 9/11 to hear the national news reports on our response to that tragedy. Woodward, who has access to the most private conversations in Washington and even to the principals themselves, might have given us a book more revealing than this. From cover to cover it is little more than a compilation of tidbits reported in the media. Except for a few names, nicknames and details labels for things, and a few details of what so-and-so thought of so-and-so's inputs at meetings, the entire panorama is fairly well-known even to me, who as I said does not get enough national news. The style lacks pith and punch, whichs makes for quick, almost mindless reading 
 The book was written before the peso devaluation and subsequent crisis and is utterly useless unless you need a paperweight.  This 3rd Edition is dated March 2002, and all hotel and restaurant pricing is from pre-devaluation. I spent November 2004 in Buenoes Aires and am headed back January 19, 2005.  Buy Time Out Buenos Aires instead: Second Edition 2004.  It is perfect 
 I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research. It is NOT usable. Most of the text is missing. I have never seen such a bad scanning result. Unbelievable. 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 I know Toni Morrison fans may not agree with me but "Love" is a real flop - at least in my opinion. The book was so boring that I could not get past the first 2 pages of the very first chapter. I couldn't get into the introduction either, so I decided to by-pass it. I read the same two pages over and over again for two days on my hour and a half commute home. It was so slow....and she had to explain every single detail about every single person or object. I couldn't take it. I'm going to give the book to one of my co-workers......she's going to attempt to read it. I'm really not trying to be mean or overly critical because I know that she's an excellent writer. I just wanted to express my view. And my view is to focus on another one of her books.    
 I acquired this book as a referesher subsequent to completing my MBA program.  It is a suprising disappointment, and I do NOT believe it is an "MBA in a BOX" by any stretch of the imagination.     I am somewhat reluctant and uncomfortable to speak negatively about any book I have read, and I have read plenty of books and review a fraction of them on Amazon.com.   Nevertheless, I have a sense of obligation to tell people that this book will most-likely not provide them the information they are perhaps looking for in terms of MBA material.  To try to be perhaps fair, I am going to highlight some important aspects in this book.   Innovation -- The concept, from Clayton M. Christensen's THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA, "that companies fail not because managers are dumb but because the system doesn't allow them to succeed" is very important as it touches on empowerment, organizational learning, and team building (and learning).     Strategy -- Yes, I agree that strategic thinking involves intuition and creativity.  I am very happy that the balanced scorecard was covered in this book, which is an excellent tool for organizations to measure performance.     Management -- Encourage entrepreneurial behavior and thinking.  Ensure your team is actually empowered to make decisions, take action.  Otherwise, how can you possibly encourage entrepreneurial behavior and thinking in an organization?   Human Resources  -- The importance of retaining and motivating the "knowledge worker" is covered, which is a concept from Peter Drucker.  Organizations must appreciate, recognize, and understand a knowledge worker's extensive knowledge.  Further, an organization must also provide opportunities for the knowledge worker to expand her/his knowledge, thereby adding value for the organization.   Marketing -- I enjoyed reading about customer relationships management (CRP), allowing the customer to frame and shape the relationship between the organization and her/himself.     CONCLUSION -- As I mentioned, this book did not meet my expectations and was somewhat disappointing.  I think the title is not appropriate and perhaps even misleading.  Nevertheless, if you want to obtain some highlights on certain subjects and prominent business personalities, this book can be useful.  
 What you think from the summary the plot is makes only about 15% of the book. The rest is enornous number of parallel plots (overloaded with useless details) very loosely related to the main plot. Also this book doesn't belong to Sci-Fi, SCIENCE is not present here. The closer to the end the more implausible it gets 
 Steve Perry came thru good, but the instrumentation was lousy, and this is remastered! Pfoohey! My vynyl is better. I want my money back. Don't think I'll buy Legacy products again 
 A waste of money and time.Information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it.So called expert tips are common knowledge...tips for a succesful email...1 be responsive to customers tip2 be honest all times,tip3test tip4 have a good mailinglist tip4 have a good offer or quality product.... WELL WELL that's great news. This book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling....You can easly see the book has been made in a few day 
 I knew when I saw this woman ranting on a Christian television program the she was likely a fanatic.  Now reading the book I'm certain.  We must always be careful of becoming one of the mindless hoards who react to the loudest screamer.  Making noise doesn't make one right 
 Dr Fjellman probably spends at least 3/4 of his space describing attractions and environs at Walt Disney World, and less than 10% of his space offering any real scholarly analysis of the sociological impacts of WDW.  It's hardly worth the price for the few pages of critique he offers, but if one is looking for a quasi-professorial description of WDW as it was 15 years ago - and especially of the first incarnation of EPCOT Center, this might be entertaining... or you could just read one of the early editions of "Steve Birnbaum Brings You the Best of Walt Disney World" - one of Fjellman's primary sources.  Where I went to college, travel guides were hardly considered valid reference material!  For a better study of Walt Disney's influence on American culture, spend your time and money on "The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life" by Steven Watts; "Married to the Mouse" by Richard Folgesong about the relationship of Walt Disney and Company with Orlando, FL, is also an interesting read 
 We just purchased this item and when we got home and loaded it up, was very disappointed in the new voice they're using for Bob, Lofty and Spud!  The video itself is great and they've introduced a new off-road 4x4 machine.  But honestly, it just doesn't seem like a Bob the Builder without the main voices we're all used to 
 as their heyday in the 70's and 80's. The musicianship is there, but it seems that they have nothing left to say 
 I can't believe the laudatory reviews this novel as received. Extremely long-winded with no discernible plot, direction or characterization. This is one of those novels that doesn't make any sense at all but receives positive reviews because people think "well, I didn't understand it, so it must be good." Sorry, I don't give any writer that much credit. Don't waste your time or money on this one 
 I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well. JU 
 of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me. poor acting and hard to understand dialoge.  would get a refund if you were in australia. but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas. and it could get lost in the mail. debr 
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 I have used a lightweight Hoover for years and was very pleased with it.  When I first received this new cleaner I was really excited with the power it had.  The third time I used it the belt broke.  With each use, my back would start hurting. The forward motion was very easy, but pulling it back was hard.  I returned this product because I felt there was something wrong with it 
 Far too little about Jededian himself.  Probably no more than a couple of pages at best.  Spent the whole book talking about other figures in detail like Ashley.  Smith was treated like an obscure character that played a very small role during that period, when in fact he was one of he few icons 
 This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors.  It is comprised of short stories -- often rather verbose short stories -- rather than the short, meaningful passages in the earlier Chicken Soup books.  The earlier books are studded with post-it stickers saving the innumerable passages I want to reread or frame, and I frequently think back to those wonderful passages.  Not these -- there isn't a single post-it sticker in the entire book, and I'm donating it to the charity fair since there's nothing worth rereading.  To be fair, I suppose that this might prove helpful to someone overwhelmed by insurmountable problems and in need of reading sappy boring story after sappy boring story -- but I, myself, was much more humbled and inspired by the earlier volumes 
 This collection of stories offers nothing new in the landscape of contemporary fiction.  There is nothing unique in the prose, just the raw stuff you'd find in Tim O'Brien or Ellen Gilchrist.  The title story is the only one I liked.  I especially hated the one told from the perspective of an Australian, it detracts from the main themes too much.  There are better choices, like Rick Moody or Annie Proulx 
 The Mexican plant must have unhappy workers.  2 paks of 8, and each tape is defective.  Either the case is broken or there are loose parts rattling around inside.  Now we'll see how Sony stands behind their warranty.  Even if they send replacements I'll probably throw them away.  It's not worth breaking a VCR on these cheap, worthless tapes 
 As a soon to be full-time consultant, I was hoping that this book would provide me answers for the few remaining questions I have. Based on the other reviews, it appeared this book would fill in those gaps, though now that I have read it, I am sorely disappointed. The most annoying aspect of the book is that the author's primary aim seems to be to show off his grasp of the various fields within computer consulting and especially the terminology and jargon. Seriously, if I REALLY need to know what an ATM switch is, I can look it up in Newton's Telecomm Dictionary. Likewise, I do NOT need a primer on IBM mainframes and PC-DOS which haven't been relevant for over 20 years. I just want to know about "Getting Started" - like the title says. The sidebars are littered with these mostly useless definitions. In addition, the book seems to offer very detailed information in the table of contents, though once you read a specific section you realize the oasis is only a mirage. There's a heading called "Examining Your Strengths" which instructs one to do this without any suggestions on how to do this and how to interpret the results and choose a niche, yet choosing a niche is one of the main points of the book. Much of the information can be useful, yet an equal amount is either so simplistic or so vague I started yelling out loud at the book. Often the author will state things like "research indicates" without even citing the research. A lot of the marketing advice seems regurgitated from bad 1990's marketing books; clearly NOT the authors strong point. If you want to read a mind-blowing 1990's book on marketing a service business, read Harry Beckwith's Selling the Invisible. Finally, the book is very dated, being a computer-related book published in 2000. The annoying little sidebar definitions become more annoying with their staleness. I could hardly keep myself from smiling/groaning at the mention that Y2K consulting is still a growth niche 
 I love this book and my son loves it too but really- I think they keep selling so many copies because people have to buy multiples when they fall apart!!!!  It would be great if they could make this in a board book without the spiral plastic ring and/or laminated pages to prevent tearing off the spiral ring. The pages easily rip off.  At $10 bucks each- I feel "ripped" off 
 I hated this book alot. Miriam made the Indians seem disgusting and barbaric. She kept talking about how bad the Indians were and blaming her family for being captured, I really thought it was dull 
 Why is this book marketed as a military thriller?  The main character, Jason, as a new convert to Christianity, suddenly can't bring himself as a Seal sniper, to kill a man in "cold blood".  Wait a minute!!!!!!!  Military snipers do not kill men in "cold blood".  We are talking about taking out the scum of the earth; the men who think nothing of killing women, children, their own family to get what they want.  In killing some of these evil men a sniper might save hundreds of lives.  Just the idea that a U.S. military sniper kills in cold blood is repulsive to me.  The insinuation is that a Christian could not be in the military without being sinful.  The story disintegrates from there with Jason going to work for a team that uses non-lethal weapons (but what in the world do we do with these pesky little bad guys when they come out of their sedative stupors?????).  We then have Jason falling all over himself over these two female operatives that dress in revealing clothing (not very godly if you ask me!) and we go into the absolutely unbelievable as the story takes the twists of a McGyver t.v. show; totally unbelievable as we are supposed to think that we can save the world without lethal weapons.  I have it!!!!  Lets give all the police in New York City some of these toys and see how they do!  I am sure the streets will be just as safe and we can all breathe easy at night!  Then the ending; he has two women in love with him, and is thanking God for this new and wonderful life.  Christian fiction!!!????????  Give me Tom Clancey....please!!!!!! 
 Ever read a newspaper article to find half of it is taken up by useless information? e.g. "Dr Kenith E. Browner (MBA, BAS, winner of the 2002 SoandSo award, local Environmentalist, Graduated from Northern SS University with honors) says to bundle up this weekend."      ...     You just can't help to skim past it all.. Which brings me to Death Valley by Keith William Nolan. Half of this book is filled with useless info! Once in a while you get a little hint of a story, but then it jumps back into naming so many battalions, sergeants, lieutenants, soldiers, weapons, equipment, points...etc   You just can't visualize anything happening with all of this... well.... I don't know what it is. One thing I'm sure of is that I totally regret setting eyes on this boo 
 After a great start, this book quickly sinks into a pop culture excerise that implements the very methods the author hopes to expose. Ads after ad is thrown onto the stage, summed up in fifty words or less, and subsequently denounced as "harmful" to society. The reasons for this pronouncement vary wildly and are almost never backed by supporting evidence. What we get are impressions, not reasoned thought.  This is unfortunate because advertising is an arena that deserves some investigation. Unfortunately, you won't find that here. Instead, you have something almost as bombastic as the alcohol ads the author attacks. There are no interviews with the artists, photographers, script writers, producers, or manufacturers of the ads that are reviewed, nor of the products they represent. There is no investigation into the market research behind the ads. There is virtually NO evidence allowed except for the author's own assumptions.  It also becomes apparant about half way through the book that the author has more at issue with the products being advertised than the advertising itself. Close to 1/3 of the book is spent exploring just cigarette and alcohol ads. The author's attitude about these products borders on abolitionism, the main thrust of her argument being not that that advertising is harmful so much as that the products advertised are inherently diabolical and lead to self destruction. Whatever one may think about these products, this is absolutely not the place for this discussion.  Not everything about this book is bad. The opening chapter, in which it is explained that the mass media exists for the purpose of fueling advertising, is excellent. Had the author stuck to that topic, I think this book would have been grand 
 Well, this won't take very long.  Warning!  Spoiler here!  Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation.  Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation.  One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing.  Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara.  Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake.    Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that.  Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time. 
 Generaly a weak book unless you have never used Excel.  I got the book because I needed help with graphical display of data. If that was your problem this book will not help you much.  
 Half of these stories I have read before, and the other half I did not like. Everything in this book is pointless. First of all, Sedaris' name in big letters on the cover. Why? Because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection. The reason the book is published? To benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about. Well, I am giving two stars and not one, just because I liked the color of the cover. Kind of greenish salad color. 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 This book is best described as insipid and a waste of time.  Very disappointing for a 'historical account'.  Worst book I've read in over a year 
 I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie 
 Kool Keith=Nasty Ass, weird Lyrics with a horrible flow, and on this CD they suck even more to craptastic beats... Have Fun 
 Leary is a hack. He wasn't "influenced" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary.   The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape.   On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original.   
 This book is poorly written, as poorly as the obviously fake positive reviews   the author always contaminates Amazon with for all his books.  Look at his different books and reviews and you will quickly see how ridiculous he cheats 
 In "Using Terri", Jon Eisenberg attempts to provide the reader with insight into the legal, ethical, moral, and medical aspects of the tragic death of Terri Schiavo.   He falls far short of the mark on all of them.  In his November 6, 2005 review for the New York Times William Saletan succinctly sums up the book:  ""Using Terri" is just another use of Terri."   Eisenberg begins with the death of his 79 year old aunt Ros trying to draw a parallel between her and Terri.  The situations could not be more different.  No one, not Eisenberg, nor her two brothers had any desire to care for Ros.   Her case is indeed tragic and agonizing.  Had she not been dehydrated to death her fate would most probably have been to remain institutionalized and uncared for until she finally succumbed to a sad end.  A very different fate awaited Terri were she to be delivered into the care of her parents and siblings.  She would have received the best loving care and devotion that her parents could lavish on her; she would have most probably lived a long life, giving love to all those around her and perhaps even being able to receive the love that was lavished upon her.  But Eisenberg and the bioethics community would have us believe that Terri's life was a life "not worthy of life".   They are absolutely certain, beyond all doubt, that a severely brain damaged person is, in fact not a person at all.   He or she is simply a vegetable to be treated as an inanimate object.  Vegetables, like pet rocks, and tomatoes can never receive love.  Vegetables do not have, nor should they have, access to the rights and privileges that "normal" people take for granted.  This certainty permeates Eisenberg's book at every level and every page.  Symptomatic of this certainty is the obscenely arrogant inscription placed by Michael on Terri's tombstone which reads "Born December 3, 1963, departed this earth February 25 1989, at peace March 31, 2005."     What Eisenberg and so many in the bioethics community conveniently forget is that all too often the most horrendous acts of cruelty and evil are committed by those that, like them, are absolutely certain that what they are doing is good and just.  Jacob Bronowski devotes a chapter in his classic work "The Ascent of Man" to the issue of knowledge and uncertainty.   In describing the Nazi horror he stands in swamp outside the crematorium at Auschwitz and declares:   "When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power."       If you feel you must read this book I would at least urge you to exam impartially the other side.  Read Wesley Smith; read David Galenter, read Dr. Daniel Eisenberg; read Jacob Bronowski; read Rita Marker, and yes read father Frank Pavone whom Eisenberg so brutal and unjustly demonizes.   They are my heroes.   And question Eisenberg's statements, his description of the events, his conclusions and especially his demonizing of those who disagree with him.  Sometimes one's motives and philosophies can be revealed in the most trivial passages.  There is one such sentence that especially struck me in "Using Terri"; on p 191 Eisenberg describes the scene at the hospice on the last day of Terri life:  "A woman blew on a shofar - a ritual horn sounded by the ancient Hebrews during battle."   As a Jew and as human being I find such appalling ignorance of my religion deeply insulting.  But in a wider sense perhaps it is symptomatic of Eisenberg's utter contempt for everything that does not fit into a purely secular framework and does not worship at the altar of the false god of autonomy.    
 To say that this book is somewhat impenetrable is a bit like saying space is slightly chilly.  There certainly are foundational theories that need to be explored in IR, but this book approaches it in the most condescending and repellent way possible.  If you enjoy overly-complex, and self-aggrandizing prose, definitely pick one up.   If not, there are likely better sources for this material. 
 I regret buying this book.  It is unbalanced and you can tell that two authors wrote it - it is dense with detail, but weakly meanders and is flawed in argument.  It dwells almost exclusively in the first third of the book on what they call the "Freak Show" new media of, in particular, Matt Drudge.  As if there aren't many, many other voices and forces out there of at least equal or better influence (e.g., the effect of the internet in general on 24/7 news, Michael Moore, Ann Coulter, George Soros, etc.).  Drudge simply isn't the sole or primary reason that Gore lost, or Clinton got caught, or Bush won.  The authors obviously hate Drudge, but he simply isn't as important as they make him out to be (you could say the "new media" in general is, but you can't say it is solely Drudge; e.g., Clinton would have gotten caught without Drudge getting his "scoop").  Also, what amazes me about these types of political analysis books is how infrequently the authors ever attribute the results of an election to the values of the people.  I truly believe that in 2004, for example, Bush won because in that year, the majority of Americans (we are talking all of America here, not just the DC-to-Boston east coast) chose to side with the values and issues presented by Bush over Kerry.  To these guys it is all about the machinations of the strategists that get people elected.  Obviously campaign strategy is important, but maybe it is 50% at most - the other half are the issues and the simple truths about the canditates.  It is not Matt Drudge posting links that John Kerry's wife referring to her ex-husband in more endearing terms than Kerry himself, or Clinton getting exposed (Clinton was so reckless it was inevitable), but rather the substance itself that matters.  Guess what?  Kerry was a stiff and there was some truth to what was said.  Just as is true with some of what has been said about Bush.  Gore sank himself because he screwed up and made misstep after misstep.  Anyway, I couldn't finish the final few chapters and am out $26.  Can I get a refund 
 I purchased this for my 3 year old son and no sooner than we had taken him out of the box and ran it on the table the treads came off.  I am constantly looking for the treads, or fixing them.  All the other Thomas toys we have are great, but Terrance doesn't seem as durable as the others, thus making this toy in my opinion a flop 
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 Was expecting something dynamic and subtle - the theme presented a great opportunity, apparently not up to the writer's capabiliities at all.  This book is silly and just not worth the read time 
 Ian McEwan is obviously a major literary talent, but the praise garnered by Amsterdam puzzles me. It is the slightest of novellas, as others have noted, and while it has its charms, the book feels dated and contrived. As McEwan is no fool, one assumes the outlandish and improbable ending is intended as an ironic and/or symbolic commentary on his two utterly self-involved main characters, Vernon and Clive. Even so, it's not particularly clever and is mildly irritating. It should hearten authors everywhere to realize (if they didn't before)that even the most talented writers hit the occasional weak fly ball. After reading several McEwan novels (this one, Enduring Love, Saturday), the achievement of Atonement is all the more remarkable. This review is not supposed to be about Atonement, but I would encourage anyone who was disappointed by Amsterdam (considering its Booker Prize, etc.)not to let that dissuade him or her from picking up Atonement. It is one of the most beautifully written, profound, surprising, and heartbreaking novels of the last quarter century. 
 I love Beatrice Small's books but I can honestly say that this book is an exception. I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books 
 `The Cutting Edge - Going for the Gold' released in '06 is a classic case of going to the well once too often. Actually I find it hard to believe they even bothered to make this film. Whether you consider this as a remake of the '92 film of the same title starring D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly, or a sequel to an ongoing storyline it fails miserably on both counts. In the first case, who does a remake of a film that's only fourteen years old? Even worse, if this is supposed to be a part two than why is the plot almost exactly the same?  To quote from the movie, "To win you have to be willing to fail." That line turns out to be nothing short of prophetic. This one definitely is a flop. Watch the '92 version and just pretend this one doesn't exist 
 Poorly done. Read Publisher Weekly's review from above, they are right on, but a little too nice. It's amazing what gets past editors' desks - the dialogue is so cheesy, even young adults should be insulted 
 When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall & Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.  Avoid this album y'all.  It's not completely terrible, but it comes dangerously close.  There are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack.  Sadly enough, this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album.  I was very disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after hearing this.  I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.  Standout Tracks: Big Daddy (My Favorite) and "You Can Get It" feat. The Lost Boyz & Soul For Rea 
 While I absolutely love the show on PBS, this season was mispackaged. The box and DVD were both labeled series 3, but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2. Unfortunately, I didn't try watching this disc until several months after I bought it. If you buy this, be sure you view it promptly to be certain it's the correct series 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 Just remember how many humans US killed in Nigeria, Vietnam, Japan, Iraq, Afghanistan, South America and every where around the world. Who lunched an atomic attack on Japan? How CIA changed the popular nationalist democratic regimes in Iran? Who must be scared of whom?  Iran has not attacked any country for the last 200 years. Iranians are the largest minority in Israel. There are more than one million Iranian in US. American people (not of course the government) are so respected and greeted when they travel to Iran. Iranians have a 2500 years peaceful relationship with Jews. We cannot harm any American or any Israeli. We like them as we like any human being.   US is located right at the other side of the globe. What danger Iran possibly can have for US.  Just travel to Iran and talk to people. Who would believe that such an emotional art-lover nation wants to harm any one?  If a president in Iran has any power, why -at the time of President Khatami- US called Iran "Axis of Evil" and did not negotiate with Iran. On the contrary, if a president in Iran has no power, then why you believe President Ahmadinejad and make such a big deal of it?  I was reading an article a few days a go written by an American and published in an American press. He frankly said "our oil flows under Iranian sand". I guess this kind of wrong attitude hidden in the mind of American politicians (specially those who own oil companies) make the world unstable and in danger.  America is in danger not because of Iran or any other country, but because of the hysteric attention-seeker attitude is being enforced to its nation by the media and books of this kind. 
 1) World War II, in both East and West, were the inducements of the British, and maybe Anglo-American joint efforts.  For what?  British wanted Hitler to attack the Soviet Union, and the British wanted Japan to suppress China's nationalist movement and to counter the Soviet Union.  In both cases, Stalin out-smarted the British and Anglo-American syndicates.  Hitler attacked westward instead, and signed a non-aggression pact with Stalin to halve Poland; and Japan attacked Southeast Asia and Pearl Harbor after China, not the Soviet Union.  2) Stalin was probably the evil genius of 20th century.  "16 out of 17 of the AMERICANS that were involved in creating the U.N. were later identified, in sworn testimony, as secret communist agents.   The first Secretary General was the AMERICAN Alger Hiss.  Hiss served time in prison pursuant to his involvement in a Communist spy ring."  The whole United States government was in fact taken over by the Comintern agents, including: Alger Hiss; Harry Dexter White; Lauchlin Currie; Laurence Duggan; Frank Coe; Solomon Adler; Klaus Fuchs; and Duncan Lee  3) There is no truth in Stalin and Truman racing against each other.  Stalin's American proxies already had Truman agree to the terms reached by Roosevelt at Yalta.  United States had completely no preparation for racing its army to Japan or Korea.   "It was after US dropped two bombs onto Japan, on Aug 6th 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 I would have given this book no stars if I could.  My Bible study group and I went through Ransomed Heart and loved it.  I can't believe how disappointing this book is and I would not recommend it.  Mr. Eldredge hides his anger (barely masked), arrogance and deceit in this book.  Do not buy it 
 Like Kenneth Haugks book, Antagonists in the Church, G. Lloyd Rediger promotes an approach to church conflict which will invariably result in individuals being unfairly labeled as clergy killers or antagonists which then is used to justify limiting their involvement in church communities. Dr. Rediger defines levels of conflict based on the histories of those involved. He therefore labels as abnormal any conflict when one or more of the persons involved have a psychiatric history especially a history of being abused. This is not a useful or valid approach. If you follow his reasoning to its logical conclusion, he is advocating that 25% of women (the estimated rate of sexual abuse in this country) be excluded from church leadership positions because they were victimized as children. His line of reasoning results in his labeling a business tycoons abuse of power as normal conflict since there is no known history of prior emotional disturbance. He also advocates that any lay person making a complaint against a minister be investigated to determine their psychiatric history. The ethics of his approach are never considered. Rather than label conflict as normal or abnormal based on individual personal histories, a fairer and more ethical approach would be to examine specific behaviors and find effective ways to promote positive outcomes for the majority of individuals involved. It is possible to reach consensus even when individuals are being difficult. Despite these serious limitations, Dr. Rediger does promote a healthier lifestyle for pastors and advocates that an effective grievance process be in place in all church communities 
 This movie had a halfway decent set up and good acting, but the storyline deteriorated as the secrets were revealed and the ending made no sense. That's 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back, honestly my time would have been better spent sitting in an empty room staring off into space, at least then I could pass it off as meditating. 
 Because this guide only comes out occasionally, the hotels often change their information. Even the year the book was published, much of the information was only partially true. One restaunt example we sampled thought that dog-friendly meant tying your dog to a pole in a parking lot on an August afternoon. Another was that the pet-friendly meant anything under 15 pounds, or maybe that you get to stay in the part of the hotel where the gangsters deal drugs (it has happened in the south, no kidding). The information is nicely organized, but is not thoroughly researched, in other words the author likely did not travel to most of the destinations, perhaps using the suspect hearsay method of information gathering. I say this because, in our travels, we have blundered upon far richer dog parks, hotels, and resorts than what were mentioned. If we could blunder upon such things with our giant dogs, imagine what gems a dedicated researcher might uncover!! I think it is worth it to get one of the big guides with more dense info to plow through. You and your pet will end up less frustrated in the end 
 Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money 
 The schematization of 'ineffable qualities' into a how to book.  I find this deeply essentially offensive - if it were only idiotic I wouldn't care. To take what is probably the most sophisticated and subtle and DIFFICULT mind-unset ever expressed on this planet and reduce it to formulas, slogans and 'decorative schemes'.  If you read this book and 'get so much out of it' and 'apply it with marvelous results to your daily life' or 'learn to accept imperfection in myself and others' you will probably not have a clue to what I'm saying. 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 This book IF YOU does not give the actual facts of why the Civil War was fought, such as the South was tired of paying unfair taxes, coastal water monopolies (by the North) and tariffs.  The IF You book goes with the party line of the South fought to keep slaves. Slavery while an issue of the Civil War wasn't a major issue; in fact some of the largest slave holders in the South were against secession as they felt slavery would be held safer in the Union then outside the Union [Even Lincoln wrote that Slavery would be held safer in the Union then outside the Union where the states who seceded would lose all constitutional guarantees). Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in hopes of starting slave revolts in the South (interesting note the Emancipation Proclamation was only for those slaves in the Confederate states it did not apply to the four Northern states that had slaves or to Southern states that were under Northern control).   The book makes the Southerners look like murdering thieves while the Union come across as the fighters for justice, it totally overlooks W.T.Sherman's march to the sea which was a war against the unarmed civilian population of the South particularly women and children who were thrown out of their houses in the dead of winter without their clothes on by the Northern troops, in many cases ganged raped and left without food to starve. The justification of such treatment towards noncombantants was that the South started the war however, it leaves out the fact that women and children in that time era had no rights and were without a voice. Women couldn't vote, weren't allowed to work, could not serve on jury duty etc. I found this book very uninformative and full of misleading information. 
 this is a great album, go out and buy it i thought palaces was a crushing album and ashes hit me like a freight train. sacrament solidifies lamb of god as the towers of current metal,  whether they want to be there or not. thats if there three previous albums - new american gospel is good, a prequel of things to come - under the name  lamb of god didnt do that already  now for the most important part:  IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY,  GO SEE LAMB OF GOD LIVE. set aside all your bickering about thrash/doom/death or black metal, hardcore, metal core, grind core, post hardcore "i hate trivium emo kids suck" whatever core, if you like  any sort of heavy music go see these men live before its all over.  you cant really stress this enough,  metal heads can vouche for me as to the importance of seeing a band live, but lamb of god are pretty much on their own cloud here in america as far as live shows go  if you saw lamb of god already at some gigantic venue, check them out again, cause their doing club shows this year.  and if you saw them before ashes came out, do yourself a bloody favor and see them now  that randy's voice (live) has grown to a multi-scale  thunder-prophet sorta crowd commanding yet never failing growl.  kicking yourself cause you never saw led zeppelin live yet had the chance to, or frustrated that you never  even got to see them live?  i'm not calling them zeppelin,  but i say dont  pass an opportunity like this up, its 2007 and there IS a  band out there worth paying to see 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 Most DeBarge songs are very good, but I purchased this collection specifically for "Rhythm of the Night".  I was very disappointed when I listened to the dance mix, which is the only version of the song on this CD. The drum beat is significantly louder, and an echo effect is used on some of the words. This CD should have included the original mix of the song, not just a crappy remix. I will sell this disc back at my local CD store, and will look for a DeBarge greatest hits collection with the original "Rhythm of the Night" 
 this movie is not scary at all  want to get freaked out watch boogeyman  very scary 
 I used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. My face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. I thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. My face cleared up instantly. When the aquamarina ran out I went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. Now, I'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. Check the lush website. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release.  But...what a disappointment!  I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts?  They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable.  And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary?  Talk about choppy. No flow at all.   This CD did make me do one thing...go back into my archives and pull out my original Grand Prix vinyl.  I think I'll be doing a transfer and retire this CD to the bottom shelf. 
 I picked up a new model Sony DVD, SACD, Progressive Scan higher end model last year and it still won't play the disc.  Seems like many other people are having issues if you search around the web.  Maybe they should be a bit more honest about how incompatible this disc is considering that the Beck site only specifies that only a "small percentage" are not compatible.  Seems more like only a small percentage are actually compatible.  CD is pretty good, but paying extra for a defective DVD shadows the good music with anger.. 
 An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful "Eat Drink Man Woman".  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman 
 I bought this CD because this band is from my home town and I've heard good things about them.I hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best Vegas has to offer I don't see much hope for our Rock Scene.This band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the Nu-Rock stations.It  reminds me of 70's bubble gum pop.Sure some of the songs are catchy,but in a David Cassidy sort of way.The singer sounds like he should be working on the Vegas strip as a Cher Impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.The Drummer is Boring.His style is Rigid,and it lacks soul.The Guitar players riffs are Flat and uncreative. Every song is about a girlfriend,or breaking up with a girlfriend...Nothing special here.It's todays Glam rock, nothing more...Save your cash 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it. 
 As a physician, research scientist, and former engineer, I agree with the author, Michael LeGault, that there is no substitute for a disciplined, evidence based, and carefully reasoned approach to thinking and problem solving.. no matter how intuitive or inspired one may feel.  I also agree that our education system is failing miserably not only our children, but the future standing of our Country - by totally abdicating it's responsibility to inculcate such a cognitive skillset in our children.  What I object to, however, and frankly find apalling, is the author's oversimplification of complex issues like CO2 emissions & Climate change, or his insinuation that ADHD may not be a legitemate clinical entity, or his lumping Daniel Goleman's book "Emotional Intelligence" with Gladwell's "Blink"..  This last gaffe I found particularly grating, as LeGault presents a false dichotomy between the (as Goleman calls them) "high road" mental processes like objectivity.. or disciplined, carefully reasoned thinking, and "low road" processes like intuition; which so vitally subserve the gut level social smarts that every day, guide us through our myriad social interactions, and help us survive and even thrive amid the harsh political realities of our "workplace", be it a newsroom in Toronto, a Research Hospital in Philadelphia, or a grammar school playground in Mississippi.  Mr LeGault's book would be fine if we all lived on Planet Vulcan..  Seeing as how we do not, however..  I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in reading this book, that they also read Daniel Goleman's new book "Social Intelligence".  Contrary to LeGault's opinion, the two paradigms are complimentary to one another, and both absolutely necessary if one is to be high functioning and at the same time, human.

 This volume would have carried a lot more weight if the proofreaders had done their jobs correctly. The many typos detracted from the sometimes useful text. The TV show Bewitched became Bewitch and near the end of the book a page just ended in the middle of a sentence. The next page started a new sentence and thought. Overall I liked what he had to say but I couldn't get past the errors. It just lost its authority with all the sloppiness. 
 Let's get one thing straight. I loved bionicle legos and when i first heard of this movie, i was hyped up to buy it. but when i saw it, i was really disappointed. let's see how this movie is:  VOICES the voices are really cheesy. They don't fit the bionicles at all. I'd rather have no voices than any!  PLOT Okay, they totally missed out on the original bionicles. They only focussed on the second bionicle design which is Ugly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THE MUSIC I have not much to say, but this music was..................... .......... freaky.  OVERALL this movie would of gotten a one star if the plot was bad nothing relating to the stories in the magazines or website. However, the plot was okay following a bit at the comics and websites. so this somewhat a "ok" movie. just be warned 
 This is rated 5 stars? This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. EVER!  IAFAA. Inappropriate For All Ages 
 I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing.  With few exceptions I think he is  a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism.  I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy.  I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much.  Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it.  If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings.  I am currently seeking  relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway.  I'd trade in a Henry  for an Ernie any day.  It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters.  The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.        
 Seth's UK publisher apparently paid £1.4m for this book WITHOUT EVEN READING A WORD!  Any publisher prepared to cough up that amount of cash so recklessly deserves an entire omelette on their face and that is pretty much what they got.  Seth is a fine writer and this is a well-crafted book.  It tells the story of his uncle (a one-armed dentist) and his aunt (a German refugee) with whom he spent some time when he first came to England.  Their tale is interesting without being remarkable and this is where the problem really lies.  Two Lives would make a wonderful 100 page short memoir.  I say this with confidence as 100 of these 500+ pages are very good indeed.  The correspondence between the couple and the stories that the letters unearth are moving and compelling reading.  The rest of the book is a bit dull really.  Something his publisher would have noticed had they bothered to read it (if indeed those stories are true).  Ho hum, publishers have their own reasons for throwing good money away.  Shame that they could have supported a whole host of exciting new authors with just a small portion of the cash they wasted on this.  If you are interested in this book (and you will wonder why you were when you read it) for goodness sake wait for the paperback.  This edition is too heavy in every sense of the word 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 I downloaded this b4 it came out and I'm glad I downloaded it. "Oh I Think They Like Me" was an aiight song when it dropped but "Lean Wit It Rock Wit It" got played out the 2nd time I heard it. Only good songs on this album are: My Music (cuz Bun B is on it) Bricks 4 The High (cuz Jim Jones on it, beat is good) Ridin' Rims (hot) Don't Play Wit Me (Three 6 Mafia can't even save DFB on this one. but ok)  
 i ALWAYS give rave reviews to books, but not this one.  i am a happily married romantic at heart, and this is the only book i have never in my life been able to finish.  (i average 35 books a year).  it was just bland and boring and oh so.......boring.  do not recommend, though, i would have liked to with such a romantic title : 
 this cd was my first dkm cd and at the time i loved it. then i got do or die and gang's all here. they made this cd look like the crap that it actually is. the songs are pretty much all the same except for the rocky road to dublin which is good but gets old fast. this cd gets old almost as fast as Flogging Molly did and that is pathetic. it almost seemed that this whole cd were just fillers. In this cd they really make it known that they are irish too but then in Boston who isnt irish. get do or die and gang's all here. if u like the irish music get some Real Mckenzies or Progues. dont succumb to the level of Flogging Molly and this cd. 
 I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one. 
 I had high expectations for this book, based on the reviews posted here with comparisons to Bill Bryson and all. I found this book uninteresting and often offensive. He offers nothing new in terms of trail description and his writing style is nowhere nearly as interesting, informative or entertaining as Bill Bryson's. To me, he comes off as a sexist and racist man who is mostly interested in the next town, barely mentioning the actual trail and descriptions of the landscape, etc. His descriptions of Mexicans and Native Americans are based on racist sterotypes and ignorance. Granted he bases these on his only previous exposure being Hollywood portrayals, but he does nothing to correct his fears that the Mexicans will steal from him or that the "Injuns" will scalp him. Just because the author is from New Zealand does nothing to make this book worthwile. I was very disappointed 
 This book seems to be comprehensive in its treatment of digital audio but unfortunately much of it is simply cut and paste from more technical articles with little attempt being made to digest and explain the material in a more accessible fashion.  For example the material on error correction on CD's hits the reader over the head with equations that come out of the blue and the reader couldn't hope to understand in a month of Sundays.  The material on analog to digital conversion is much the same. Nonetheless this book serves as a compilation of relevant topics in digital audio but fails to provide the reader with the intuition to really internalize the material.  
 I was very disappointed in the author's crude use of words and profane language. It would be a good read, if she had left out certain parts. This is not a book I feel comfortable sharing with my own adopted Russian son until he is much older, and I certainly can't recommend it to others without warning them first 
 The author writes about saffron the way I cook with saffron - sparingly.  The book was probably 70% autobiography and 30% saffron.  There were times where I would finish a chapter thinking, "Where was the saffron in that?"  I'll probably only ever read one book about saffron, and it was a mistake to have it be this one 
 This book is incredibly boring and tedious to read.  It has no plot; I fell asleep every time I tried to read it.  It isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the Indians have the ability to talk to animals.  Remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; James Welch takes foreshadowing a little too far.  A final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 This wasn't very useful to me. It contains merely lists of possible conflicts and conversations one might base an improvisation around. The ideas arn't particularly imaginative and are nothing I or my students couldn't come up with ourselves 
 I do not like this cd.,  but Jon's Three Ships I have on album for many years and need this out on CD now.  It is one of the best Christmas releases ever.  
 I just have to balance the one (positive) review with one of my own. As a lover of travel fiction and as someone with an abiding interest in Japan (and a frequent traveller there), I must say that this is among the very worst books I have ever read. As travel literature, it strikes me as the product of someone who's never actually been to the place he's writing about.  As erotica or as humour, it falls completely flat. The overriding tone it left me with was that of an author who wrote a novel in a weekend on a dare. Zero attempt at involving the reader. Zero attempt at character or plot development. The characters are just put through their paces and then abandoned. Even had I paid 78 cents for the book I would have felt cheated at the time I wasted on it (and I spend a lot of time reading). Do yourself a favour and stay away, or at the very least, don't let this book help you form any opinions whatsoever on the country of Japan 
 I cant believe that I actually paid for this book. Anyone with a brain knows that if you buy low and sell high, you will make money. If you know that then you dont need this book. This book is silly. I cant believe that it was even printed. 
 I try to support African American movies but when they put out garbage like this I have to let my displeasure be known.  The plot was stupid and there was absolutely no chemistry whatsover between the main characters.  Even the attempts at comedy were horrible.  There was nothing about the characters that made you want to invest in the characters or the storyline.  I just wanted the movie to be over with because I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me find some redeemable factor in this movie but nothing.  Bad actors, bad acting, bad directing, and terrible writing.    
 i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone 
 Christina Aguilera is so Dirrty She gonna need a bath. This song is disgusting and has anyone seen the video? it's even wors 
 This movie combines the worst traits of a vanity production combined with a "Let's make a movie" amateur hour style.  The plot  is ludicrous, the script foolish and inept, the acting so crude as to be embarrrassing.  The whole thing makes you wince.  There are scenes staged more or less in the style of Ed Wood with bits and pieces of business from who knows where, but without Wood's sincerity and conviction, both of which make that director's inepitude and crudity both touching and original.  But  this movie  is merely bad.  What is worse, it tries to confront issues which, in better work, should be important.  The problem does not lie merely in the fact that it is a low budget movie.  Green Plaid Shirt, for example, was made for very little money.  But it is everything that Sideline Secrets is not:  movingly and convincingly acted, brilliantly directed, touchingly written, and at times profound.  It's worth watching over and over.  It was hard for me to watch Sideline Secrets even just once 
 Please don't get sucked in like I did.  All she does is endlessly talk about herself and then give you one tiny suggestion at the end like, start a diary.  It's ridiculous!  I tried her tape set and found it   horrible! It's an absolute abomination of her endlessly saying how she will eventually help you.  And she will tell you to listen to her saying that same thing for two weeks straight, while your time gets sucked up.  It's criminal! 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 I don't know where to begin deconstructing this idiotic book.  Although the author certainly did his homework, detailing the history of Psychology with great accuracy, its entire premise is without merit.  The oldest enemies of Science have always been Christians, and this book is just another attempt to reconcile the superstitious beliefs of Christianity with the FACTS Christians are presented with every day which refute their beliefs.  And PLEASE don't start with that tired old argument of "Psychology is just a bunch of theories."  From the heliocentric solar system, to gravity, to the origins of life on our planet, to the Big Bang, EVERYTHING is just theory...but we still have electricity, internal combustion engines, medicine, and countless other scientific marvels that make our lives incalculably more enjoyable and fruitful than they would be if we simply followed the Bible's explanations.  Vitz is simply adding Psychology to Christianity's long list of the persecuted (Copurnicus, Galelio, Blacks, Gays, Women, etc., etc.)  Religion/Science battles aside, the whole idea of Psychology being a religion is preposterous.  Religion is a philosophy based upon blind acceptance, not facts.  Psychology is a SCIENCE, a totally different philosophy which requires tentative acceptance of the simplest correct explanation for an event based upon observation, AND willingness to accept new explanations when evidence suggests we are wrong.  Religions are designed to be static, and their followers never admit to having "changed the rules," even though they often do so to fit their own needs as people become less and less naieve (read as "more and more educated").  In short, this book is ridiculous propaganda from a Right-Wing Conservative Christian who has written numerous books in an attempt to fend off the ensuing doom of his own superstitious beliefs.  It's a "if you can't beat 'em, bash 'em" mentality that drives this author, and anyone with even a cursory understanding of Psychology will resist the temptation to buy this waste of paper 
 What dooms "A Son Called Gabriel" is a combination or too much ambiguity at the end and too little focus throughout.  By the unsatisfying end, I never felt any connection to the book or to the relatively flat characters.  It might just be that I've read far better books on the subject of a young man grappling with his sexual identity.  I agree with another reviewer who remarked this entire book could have been condensed into a Part I with a Part II and possibly Part III that get to the meatier times in Gabriel's life after he leaves for college.  That Gabriel plays with girls and dolls and wants to be a hairdresser at 7-9 is interesting--albeit stereotypical--but doesn't warrant 100 pages of development.  The early teen years also don't add a lot.  Really nothing gets moving in this story until Gabriel's 16-18 or so and by then it was almost over.  There's a lot of lip service given to the Catholic-Protestant "Troubles" in the 60s, 70s, but it's never clear how any of this really affects Gabriel's development.  Since he's boyfriend to a Protestant girl, I'd have to say the political tensions didn't matter a whole lot to him.  In which case, it doesn't add much to the story.  At the end of course there's the big Scarlet Letter/Empire Strikes Back twist, which only distracts readers from the fact that the ending raises more questions than it answers.  What will happen to Gabriel in London?  Will he and Fiona stay together?  Was Father Brendan a homosexual?  We'll never know unless there's a sequel in the works.  As for the writing, it was average.  I thought the author was guilty of run-on sentences at a few points, but that's just me.  There wasn't enough scene-setting.  Instead, we get a lot of rushing through test preparations/results and repetitive encounters with school bullies.  As a result of all the rushing around, there wasn't time to really develop the characters.  The rest of Gabriel's family isn't much different than any sitcom family because there wasn't time to really settle in and flesh out their personalities into more than one dimension.  But as I said at the beginning, my lack of enthusiasm might be because I've read better books on the subject.  "A Home at the End of the World" by Michael Cunningham, "Kavalier and Clay" by Michael Chabon, and "Line of Beauty" by Alan Hollinghurst top that list, the latter two winning the Pulitzer and Booker Prize respectively.  By comparison, "A Son Called Gabriel" isn't in the same weight class 
 Incredibly unfunny DVD. And before you jump in say "she's edgy and you just don't get it" save your breath. Sarah has no edge, or sense of humor. If you pay attention, the audience isn't even laughing very much. A complete waste of money and time 
 Steve Brusatte needs to work more on expanding his repertoire of what he calls "stately fossils," because these are only limitted to certain states. Additionally, he needs to work more on clarifying his ideas through careful selection of dictions and writing style. He needs to publish a second edition 
 This was my first Puzo book.  I was expecting an entertaining read.  Instead, I found the book to be a confusing chain of family dramas involving numerous un-engaging characters, plodding towards a conclusion that was less than exciting.  Paricularly annoying were the in-depth, opinionated (introspective?) analysis of the world of hollywood film making.   Maybe the choppiness and numerous twists and mini-dramas is just the nature of mafia stories.  Maybe I am just reading the wrong genre.  Because the only real thrill I got was upon completion of this book 
 He is NOT a doctor. The only degree he has is from a unaccredited CORRESPONDENCE school!!! It was shut down by court order in 2001. He paid $72 for his "degree". He is now involved in Oasis Life Sciences, a MLM selling junk 
 The CD was received however, it can't be played because something is wrong with it..it screeches and pops and won't play.  But its open so I can't return it.  Very disappointed 
 I tend to agree with Mo Ramchandani's review, this is a terrible film and given that it went straight to video is a miracle, it really should have gone straight to RADIO.  What is interesting is how our friend Albert made the connection between Mo Ramchandani who reveiwed the film and MOHIT Ramchandani who produced Two Days, could they be the same person, pherhaps, but what is more obvious is that Albert is really an alias for acclaimed director Sean Mcginly continues promoting his film.  I am a huge fan of Mcginly's other work starring Karl Wiedergott "The Truth about Juliet".  Sheer Genius!!  speaking of strange charcters, how would albert come to the conclusion that Mo Ramchandani is filing a petty grieveance, could he not juts be an honest producer who has gone on to bigger and better things??? 
 "...Allosaurus liked to hunt,and when it caught its quarry,it tore it open,back and front,and never said," I'm sorry!" Allosaurus liked to eat,and using teeth and talons,it stuffed itself with tons of meat,and  guzzled blood by gallons." If you think your child does not see enough  violence on TV then you should buy this book 
 Years before Dan Brown's book came out, I had read five books on the subject of the Holy Grail, and I even visited Renne le Chateau in the south of France.  I finally concluded that this whole supposed mystery is just another campaign for European aristocrats to link their bloodline with that of Jesus.  I am one of those conspiracy nuts who doesn't believe in accidental history.  Many, if not most events, are planned well in advance to achieve a certain objective, ie, more control for the Powers That Be. Reviewers have derided this book due to its lack of facts and poor scholarship.  Please tell me of one scholar who can prove that Jesus even existed.  There isn't one shred of secular documented historical evidence proving the existence of this incredible man who performed miracles throughout the land.  The Romans kept as meticulous records as the Nazis, and surely they would have noted and been alarmed by this rebel rouser in such a seditious area.     The real scandal is that the gospels were written by the Romans.  I lived in Rome and studied Roman history for many years.  I asked myself why the Romans, specifically the aristocratic Piso family, needed to create Christianity. First,it would be easier and particuarly unifying for the Romans to worship one central god, or SUN of god, and also simplier and more efficient to tithe.  The New Testament ordains that one Render Under Caesar... which actually makes Caesar equal to god!  And you must reverently pay taxes to him.  Christianty would foster more loyalty and nationalism.  The vestal virgin and goddess worship was presented in the virgin mother story.  The religion would create new jobs with the construction of churches and monuments. There would be new positions to administer, indoctrinate and police the flock of followers.  The Romans could continue to justify and sustain slavery because slaves could be placated by hope knowing they would receive their reward in heaven and continue to be obedient to their master as god commanded.  People would not need to be independent thinkers and study philosophy as everything they needed to know was in the New Testament.  To question its origins would be blasphemy and inspired by the Devil, a new common enemy to fight against.  Unbelievable?  What happened during the Dark Ages?  This was understandable because only the wealthy were educated, but what excuse to people have today to accept such fairytales without any proof of its leader's authencity?  Even worse, Fundamentalist Christians insist that the Bible was written by god, as if he actually penned the entire book which was written,and rewritten, over centuries.  What a monumental and ingenious scam, along with the other two submission religions of the Jews and Muslims.  Wake up people!  Dan Brown's book and this one are prime examples of exploiting people's ignorance as the Holy Grail Mystery did to me until I began to unravel the whole Christian Con.  Do your own research on this site or at Google: Piso and Jesus, etc 
 I bought this book due to the fact I am a direct descendant of the family that is the topic of this book.  I have also read much of the Harwood Diaries themselves and was curious to see the author's interpretations.  There are many parts of this book which are just verbatim quotations strung together from the Harwood Diaries.  In other parts of the book the author seems determined to prove his theory of hatred and jealousy amongst the Harwoods.  this is not the true story by any means.  The true story is told in the Harwood Diaries themselves.  As with any family there were squabbles but they did not dominate the relationships between the Harwoods as the author suggests.  The author fails to get the name of the first Harwood in the United States correct as well which surprised me, given the considerable writings on this subject available in the Southern Vermont area. While I agree that the book is entertaining in its own right, from a factual standpoint it leaves a lot to be desired 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 I wasn't expecting a show book, I was expecting more of a birthday cake book, that you can actually do something with.  Oh sure you can do these cakes in here...  but would you want to 
 I have to agree with other reviews on here. This is a piece of junk. I just bought this timer... took it out of the package and it did not work! 
  Only a short bus rider like Debbie davis  could love this book.This book is the second book in a row this parish character wrote and its boring an old news from the old tabloids.Unless you have lived under the dirt there is nothing new here. Just an obvious attempt to make money. This has been done much better by better writers like Bob Thomas and James bacon and Earl Wilson!!!!- Note- one reviwer wrote Don Johnston of Beach Boys wrote I write the songs. His name is Bruce dear 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 The quality is not there and as said in previous review, do not try to "chop up" a classic.  For someone who wants a wonderful Ray Price assortment, true to the LP arrangements but on CD, you might consider a 3 disc collection from:  www.timelessmusic.com which is a lot more Ray Price for the same money.  It is a Sony product and has chrystal clear sound.  I have been a Ray Price fan since "Night Life" and this album is not up to his standards.  That is just my opinion 
 Unbelievable:  	This book was hard to stomach.  I'm use to reading Protestant apologetic nonsense from those who don't claim to be theologians, but Willing to Believe is marketed as "a major work" by a guy who purports to be a "professional theologian," and yet the book is so filled with fiction that you really need to be ignorant of Christian theology to take it seriously.   Someone gave Dr. Sproul a Ph.D; one would think he would at least attempt to be professional.  Trying to align St. Augustine with Luther and Calvin, Dr. Sproul not only seriously distorts the teachings of the saint, but also the teachings of the Reformers.  Anyone who has actually read St. Augustine, Luther, and Calvin knows that the Reformers were as far from St. Augustine as were Pelagius and Nestorius.  Sadly, Dr. Sproul, Luther, and Calvin all seem to have missed St. Augustine's words in the Enchiridion; "Whosoever, therefore, says that to be a man is evil (the Reformed doctrine of man's total depravity), or that to be wicked is good (the Reformed doctrine that after justification man remains evil, as well as the Reformed doctrine of predestination to Hell prior to foreseen demerits), comes under that prophetic condemnation: Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil.  For such a man finds fault with the works of God, that is, with man, and he praises the defect of man which is iniquity.  Every being therefore, even though it be imperfect, is good so far as it is a being; so far as it is defective, it is evil" (Enchiridion 4.13).  As regards St. Augustine's stance on the ability of man to cooperate with justifying grace, Dr. Sproul insists he denied it absolutely.  Apparently he never read St. Augustine's sermon 11; "He who created you without your cooperation does not justify you without your cooperation.  He who created you without you knowing, will not justify you without you knowing" (Sermon 11.13).  As Dr. Sproul rightly points out, God creates the free act of the good within us.  But our will is not passive as he insists.  Such a view necessarily implies double predestination and the doctrine that God creates men for the sole purpose of evil, with Hell as their end - thus making God the author of evil.  Dr. Sproul tries valiantly to wriggle out of this, but he cannot escape logic without lying.  That is why he is forced into distorting the teachings of not only the Reformers, but of St. Augustine and the Catholic Church which has always insisted that God creates the free act of good within man, but in such a way that man's free will is not violated.  Even man's ability and willingness to cooperate with God's grace is caused by God.  Furthermore, even though God moves man to freely choose the good, he moves man to choose the good infallibly because due to his omniscience God is able to present to man the very grace God knows the man will not resist, even though the ability to do so remains within him.  Dr. Sproul refuses to acknowledge that what the Council of Orange condemned in semi-Pelagianism was not man's ability to cooperate with God's grace, but man's ability to make a first movement toward God without God's special grace.  When Dr. Sproul teaches that man is unable to cooperate with God in his justification, he makes God the author of evil and is teaching heresy, pure and simple.  Anyone reading this book to get a better idea of the Christian doctrine of free-will and justification should beware that Dr. Sproul is not presenting anywhere near a true picture of the history.   	Finally, Dr. Sproul presents the arguments of various Protestant theologians through the last four centuries attempting to show whether they conform to the doctrine of the Reformers.  The depth of confusion and disagreement among Protestantism renews in me a thankful praise for the guidance of the Holy Spirit offered to the Catholic Church "until the end of the age." 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 Mike Wallace has been engaged in his so- called hard- hitting journalism for years. But anyone who has studied Wallace close-up knows he has engaged repeatedly in some of the most dishonest of all journalist practices. In the late eighties his crew was caught paying Palestinian youths to throw rocks at Israeli soldiers. This provided good film footage. Wallace's most recent interview which is not included in this book is a perfect illustration of the dishonesty in another way. The very same week Wallace interviewed him Ahmadinejad spoke in Iran before a screaming hystircal audience. He ranted against the United States and said how it would fall apart. But his most bitter cursings were for Israel and he repeatedly shouted to his audience , in Hitlerlike fashion 'Death to Israel'  Now switch to the interview. Wallace says Ahmadinejad is personable , does question him about his Holocaust denial, but lets him off relatively easily. There is no mention of proposed genocide, or politicide, only that Ahmadinejad is against the 'Zionists'  Years ago watching Wallace I noticed how insulting and aggressive he could be with those who did not share his political views.  Edward R. Murrow he is not. 
 Daniel Mason's The Piano Tuner turned out to be a disappointment.  Impressive as the it was as a first novel, the lack of editorial skill applied to its pages was overwhelming. A few pages into the novel, two facts are obvious: one, that the writer was American while his subject was the British, and two, that the author inappropriately projected his twentieth century values on a different time and place.  Most dialogues were difficult if not impossible to imagine taking place between the English (for instance, the drunken soldiers talking about Carroll) because of language use, sentence structure, diction ,etc.  Certain scenarios were so American in their construct that transferring it to British Burma (or to British anywhere - even today) was ludicrous. The outcome is unfortunate: stilted and contrived.  For those readers who are interested only in plot, you will probably enjoy this book. However, if you are concerned with historical realism or style, you will be disappointed before you hit the second chapter. 
 Hooray - may Sick Rantorum find out just how cold it is in the world that thinks men who say mothers with limited incomes need to learn "struggling is not necessarily a bad thing" belong in. Happy struggling, Ricky Rat, ye who gave yourself pay raises while fighting attempts to increase minimum wage, who declared his sympathy for fighting AIDS in Africa but compared gays to "man on dog sex." My guess is you won't be on U2's guest list much longer, despite trying to link your campaign to Bono's good works.    One of my favorite moments of an evening of viewing CNN's election coverage was watching that pompous gasbag Bill Bennet melt into a pile of foul-looking disgust as his neocon creepies got voted out one by one and the balance of the power in the House was declared Democrat. May these hateful, intolerant, weasels choke upon their plate full of crow as the march to 2008 regime change gathers steam and join Sick Rantorum in history's dustbin of Neanderthals 
 Scattered throughout The Origin of Wealth is a five star survey of new ideas in economics, incorporating discoveries from science and psychology.  Unfortunately, in the end, the book is undone by Beinhocker's unfortunate habit of stating hypotheses and non sequiturs as facts, and his continuous harping on "Traditional" economics (and "Traditional" finance) as obsolete and irrelevant.  Also, the book is quite uneven in the amount of detail presented; there's too much sometimes (which is tedious), and too little other times (which is frustrating).  I really wanted to be able to give the book three stars because of its broad scope and entertaining analyses, but just cannot do so after a few days of mulling over the entirety of its content.  If you can separate the wheat from the chaff, it's a decent read; but if you are not already familiar with the subject matter discussed, caveat emptor (buyer beware)!  Some examples of the unevenness of detail:  Several times the author described computer simulations, but did not include enough detail for the reader to fully understand how they were set up.  For example, in one simulation of evolution, 1's and 0's were referenced as having been strung together to represent strategies in the "prisoner's dilemma" game.  Unfortunately, the author did not bother to explain how the strings of digits corresponded to the strategies; therefore there was not enough information to figure out how the simulated evolution actually worked.  In another case, over a page is consumed in an unnecessary blow-by-blow description of how a factory manager might increase production capacity, only to see the demand cycle slowing due to a feedback lag.  A distracting aspect of Beinhocker's presentation is the way that he repeatedly refers to mainstream economics as "Traditional Economics" with a capital T, indicating that it is not progressing, is resistant to change, and is obsolete.  Of course, like any science, mainstream economics evolves slowly, but I don't think that a neutral observer could say that economists as a whole have not been open to new ideas over time.  "Traditional" economics is actually in the process of absorbing some of the results he relates -- for example those from behavioral economics -- but you wouldn't know it from the text.  There are many statements in the book that seem questionable, but are stated as if they are incontrovertible facts.  For example: that punctuated equilibrium is a fully accepted part of standard evolution theory (it's still under debate), that success in evolution can be fully defined by a "fitness function" (success in evolution is ultimately defined by success itself), that the second law of thermodynamics applies to the interactions between people (just because something applies to atoms doesn't mean that it applies to people -- consider the strong nuclear force).  The main part of Beinhocker's thesis is that the economic system can be equated to an evolutionary system, with companies consisting of a set of "businesses" that interact with each other in the economy.  Businesses that are "fit" replicate, and those that are not disappear.  He creates the concept of a hypothetical, written business plan that corresponds to DNA in evolution.  This is a neat concept, but the parallel doesn't quite work.  DNA "describes" the organism in a condensed, holistic manner.  A business plan fully describing a business would have to be as complicated as the business itself.  In the final section, Beinhocker presents implications of his new complexity-based, evolutionary economics for business and policy.  For business, a major implication is that a company should not try to determine up front what strategy will work, but should set up different parallel businesses with different strategies and see how things go before betting on a single strategy.  Ignoring the issue of when a company should stop providing capital to a business, -- What if the "fittest" business takes the longest to succeed? -- this is precisely what is suggested by such strategic frameworks as the BCG matrix, which were developed well before complexity economics.  Basically the concept comes down to the old saw of not putting all ones eggs in one basket.  It's also an implication of CAPM, "Traditional Finance", that diversification is optimal.  (By the way, according to the book, "Traditional Finance" is obsolete also!)  (Beinhocker also finds an "implication" that companies should take a stakeholder approach and favor growth over return to shareholders.  I cannot see how this follows from the theory, but I'll let it go.)  In terms of policy, The Origin of Wealth gets really crazy.  Somehow Beinhocker comes to the conclusion that Behavioral Psychology favors universal health care coverage and a "minimum living wage."  (In all fairness, Beinhocker is relating the proposals of a Matt Miller; however, he strongly supports them also.)  The text presents these policies as if they are consistent with Strong Reciprocity, but how can these benefits be reciprocal when they apply to everyone regardless of behavior?  (He also conveniently ignores moral hazard, and politicians' strong incentives to manipulate programs to benefit themselves.)  It's not so much the conclusions -- e.g., no one can argue that the proposed strong elementary education for all is a bad idea -- but the fact that they don't follow logically from the premises.  The bottom line is that describing economics as an evolutionary system is fine, but there is really nothing that you can draw from the resulting model prescribing any particular strategy or policy.  In order to see what will happen to the economy as the result of a new policy, one would have to create a simulation as complex as the economy itself -- in essence one would have to create an entire, new economy; or one could just try the policy and wait and see what happens.  On the other hand, "Traditional Economics" gives us such theories as the law of supply and demand and interest rate parity.  The law of supply and demand may not be perfect, but at least it predicts that a business will reduce sales if it raises prices.  Interest rate parity isn't perfect, but at least it predicts that if a central bank raises rates, it should see a strengthening of its currency.  Don't give up on mainstream, "Traditional," economics yet!  (If you are considering this book, you should check out "More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places" by Michael Mauboussin, which applies some of the same theories of science and psychology to investing; and "Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations: A Story of Economic Discovery" by David Warsh, which presents a history of the development of mainstream growth theory. 
 Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables 
 The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Buren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing "That Makes It." Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann.

  This book is as others have stated an emotional plea rather than an academic work.  Yes, I believe the Holocaust was a reality but this work only leads me into denial owing to the he said she said argument.  Where are the facts, footnotes, and scholarship?  I would pass this book over, a waste of time and money.

 Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its title.  It does provide a brief introduction to quite a number of models, theories and other published material with some explanation to what they are and when to use them. However, it does so rather superficially and the language is never quite right. It attempts to be practical, but never really succeeds; at least not if you have any prior experience with organizational change.  It is too much of an introduction with too loose a structure and never becomes relevant in its' recommendations and method 
 I wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it.  Will not renew, not what I wanted 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 This book is based upon Brenda Ueland's experience teaching creative writing to adults and her success at freeing many of her students from inhibitions that prevented them from writing well.  It is basically a "pep talk" for anyone who thinks they cannot write or have nothing important to say.   And it has some interesting insights about the mysterious nature of inspiration and the role leisure plays in creativity.  ["Leisure: The Basis of Culture," by Josef Pieper, is a more advanced exploration of this theme.]  However, the book is interlaced with so much dubious philosophy that I cannot recommend it.  For example, on page 129, Brenda begins with this gem:  "I have come to think that the only way to become a better writer is to become a better person."  However, she then ruins this thought by saying that by "better person" she does not mean a good person "for a great person often does things that so-called good people think very bad indeed."  She does not explain what she means by a great person.  But it seems to mean someone who is an independent thinker; an astute observer who does not accept social conventions or values that cannot be affirmed through their own inner wisdom.  Brenda does not consider the possibility that one's inner "truth" can be faulty.  She relies upon quotations from the poet William Blake (one of her great people), entitling Chapter Five: "Sooner Strangle an Infant in its Cradle than Nurse Unacted Desires," based upon one of his noble sentiments about deferred gratification.  Blake saw visions and heard voices which he believed were Divine rather than demonic.  Brenda also prefers this interpretation and thus agrees with Blake's conclusion that our inner voice which says "Thou shalt" is our true conscience, while the voice that counsels "Thou shalt not" is the product of learned behavior and should be rejected.  (See page 13 and footnote on page 35.)  Later, on page 174, the author reveals herself to be a ho-hum, garden-variety relativist.  She writes, "If it is true to you, it is true.  Another truth may take its place later.  What is truly from me is true, whether anybody believes it or not.  It is my truth."  The problem with all this philosophy is that the author tells the reader that they too must tend toward the amoral and asocial aspects of the psychopathic personality if they want to be an independent thinker and hence, a great writer.  She teaches that the end justifies the means.  Whatever gets the creative juices flowing is justified.  And the stream of consciousness that gushes forth, whether polluted or pristine, is art.  It is art because it is true to the inner self of the artist, who has learned to cast off all restraint, fear, and ambition.  (I wonder what Brenda would think about the latest notions of modern psychology that radical independence is a less mature emotional state than cooperative inter-dependence?)  Finally, the author presents her view as an either/or scenario.  Either you adopt the reckless and rule-less approach to writing, or you're creativity will be stymied.  She does not allow for the option that one can be creative and value-oriented at the same time.  Potential readers of this work should be aware that behind the enthusiastic pep talk there lurks a relativistic philosophy which may not correspond with their personal beliefs

 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved. 
 In order to answer the questions in this edition of Trivial Pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of SNL.  Most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family, who have watched SNL since it began, and who quote it frequently.  I was very disappointed in this game. 
 Like others I was mislead by the false description given.  I waited to open the box til the 21st so that my daughter would not see it. I didn't realize til I took it out the packaging that it had legs and not a tail!  Now I have had to go to ebay and it's doubtful that it will be here by Christmas. Very disappointed in Amazon 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 coming from a rock viewpoint, this music is garbage. I see all the other bad reviews and they're getting very low percentage for how helpful they are, and I can't help but think that all those votes are from Air-affiliated entities. As one other reviewer stated, all the songs are repetitive and boring. Some of the songs use the same exact notes throughout the entire song. In my opinion, a lot of today's pop has much more musical talent than this album 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 The baby bjorn is a nice carrier. I received one for my baby shower. However, I hardly used it. I thought I would use it a lot but I found I hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much. Before that, the many straps made me afraid I was going to drop the baby. But probably the same problem for other carriers. I was really surprised by how little I used it, since I really wanted to carry my bab 
 This movie really sucked. It was very sad. What was the director thinking? Rent it first before you think of buying it. It's not good at all. If you want a great movie watch The Perfect Man, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper by the Dozen 1 & 2, or Material Girls. 
 Definitely not as good as "Down in Albion".  THAT record is magic.  This ep is...I dunno...nothing special.  It's missing something.  Mick Jones?  Junk?  Not sure.  I had high expectations from Pete, and this was a bit of a let down 
 J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money 
 Good book, but very dated. Kessler is very informed about the workings of the CIA and the backgrounds of its employees and directors, but only up to when this book was published. It has a lot of interesting folklore about the beginning of the CIA and its different divisions. It's a good read if you want to get an overview of its structure and an idea of its mindset of the CIA up to and just after the fall of the Soviets. That being the post WWII era and the cold war. If he were to go back to this book's subject I am sure he would be able to gain a wealth of newer information more applicable to the current situations we face as a nation 
 Appleman's Developing ActiveX Components with Visual Basic 5.0 was so good that I bought Developing COM/ActiveX Components with Visual Basic 6.0 when it came out. Both of these were among the very best VB books of all time. Unfortunately, Moving to VB.NET is not in the same camp. The book tries to introduce VB6ers into VB.NET, but does a very bad job of getting from A to B. Most developers can understand most of .NET after discovering that it's 80% Java with keywords changed. Instead of starting with this foundation, the book wastes a lot of space explaining prinicples that are new to only the most hardcore Microsoft zealots. In Appleman's defense, this book was first published when .NET was still in beta and was likely rushed to press. Don't get me wrong, there is some great technical content here as Appleman is still a great technician and good at explaining the "internals" of things. The COM Interop and Accessing the Win32 API chapter is particularly good and helped me get through a VB6/VB.NET integration project. If you're totally new to VB.NET and find this book on sale, buy it; otherwise, don't bother 
 I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better. 
 The discoveries made by the COBE satellite were truly astounding: the microwave background has a blackbody spectrum, the diffuse IR background, and the fluctuations in the radiation temperature (the 'wrinkles'). Unfortunately, the author spends too much of the time making it out as if he really made the discovery and leaving out how it was actually made by the whole science team. Furthermore, there is no mention of how he ignored the disclosure rules of his groups and held a self-aggrandizing press conference before the official announcement of the measurements.  For a much better accounting of this historic experiment, read the book by John Mather, the other recipient of the Nobel for COBE 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 This cookbook was a HUGE disapointment! These recipes are the same ones that you can get on the boxes and labels at the grocery store for free! Fried eggs? The pictures are nice, tho they don't name the pictured food. If you want a good soul food cookbook, get "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook"  for 1/4 the price 
 Not for designers. Dull and boring and possibly good for the corporate puppet, but not for creatives. Stick with the Edward Tufte books for real information on graphs and charts and communicating effectively through these mediums.   If you still want to purchase this book, my copy is for sale.... cheap 
 When this book was published I was early in my career as a Pentecostal preacher.  Baldwin's desctiption of the religious fervor, the "tarrying" meetings was sensitive and clear. It took such a person to reveal so much about himself and the selt-deprecation (or self-flagellation).  This was a significant part of the lives of those--both black and white--who were taught to despise self to gain the greater approval and glory of God.   This book, especially, was a major turning point in the attitude of those who did not know or care about the "holiness people," the pentecostal, the poor black, or even the acceptance of one whose gender choice was of the same sex.  I would recommend that everyone find a copy before they become out-of-date printings. We live in a much more accepting and tolerant society today but we can continue to improve.     
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 I am afraid I was quite disappointed in this book. The review in the Times that I had read made it sound like a much more profound and important book - one I would like to own rather than just take out of the library. I had previously enjoyed other books by John Mortimer, but this book was just a collection of random musings which did not hold together at all. 
 I am a cookbook collector, and I specialize in Jewish/Kosher cookbooks (I have over 60 in that category alone) and I must admit this is a beautiful cookbook, really more a coffee table book than anything else. There are gorgeous photos of ancient Judaica and interesting bits of history on almost every page and many of the recipes are tempting.   BUT... although the book is organized by season, beginning with Autumn and the Jewish New Year, the holidays are listed in the wrong order! Chanuka is listed as the Winter holiday and then we immediately jump to Spring and Passover, followed by Purim which is also included in the spring section.  Hello?!  How hard is it to go to your local Kosher butcher and get a Jewish calendar? Or look on the internet?  Presumably there was at least one Jewish person on the editorial staff who would have known whom to ask. Purim falls in Adar which coincides with February and/or March - clearly still winter in the Northern Hemisphere.  Purim is followed by Passover which is THE spring holiday followed seven weeks later by Shavuout (which translates as Weeks in Hebrew, because of those sevens weeks).   Hadassah places Purim between Passover and Shavuout! This major error continues to be so much of a turn off to me that the book sits on my shelf gathering dust and causing aggrevation whenever I think of it 
 Actually I was quite disappointed. I did not expected it to be very quantitative but I think he is repeating himself all along. I'd rather have an idea explained once and clearly than 3 times, because at the 3 rd time I get bored and then I may miss something interesting. May be though he could not sell his book at such a price if it were shorter. Moreover, his approach to quant is more of a cooking receipe. I dont see the point of having a book with calculus without justification. Or you want it to be read by non quant and you don't put cooking receipe but only few numbers, or you want it to be more quanti and you don't put receipe but explanations. Anyway...it is a try on a non easy subject 
 I beg to differ with the reviewer that described this work of fiction as being written on a third grade level - that is just plain mean-spirited.  It was actually written on a fifth-grade level!  I actually laughed aloud at the implausiblity of some of the situations - the one-dimensional characters, the coincidences and the fact that none of the other law enforcement agencies investigated any of the "accidents" incurred by the Winthrops is just ludicrous! And Dana's globetrotting at what must have been enormous expense when most of the questions could have been answered through a phone call.  Earlier Sheldon works were so entertaining - he should probably hang it up if this is all he can manage at this stage in his life 
 Charles Upton, I am sad to say, is no Rene Guenon. While Guenon eschewed apologetics, marking his writings as the work of a real sage, Upton cannot resist making the arguments that Guenon made earlier and better. In fact, due to his long history as a beatnik, hippy, New Ager, and mainstream liberal, Upton has a hard time shedding many of the problematic baggage he has accumulated over the years. He praises Noam Chomsky and still seems constantly susceptible to egalitarian, moralistic thinking at nearly every turn. In short, Upton has decided to write a book on a subject he is not yet qualified to pontificate about. While reading his book, I wondered whether he will migrate, at some future point, away from "Traditionalism" in the same way he moved on from the New Age and his other interests. The saddest, and yet at the same time most fascinating aspect of his book, is how he manages to unintentionally render Tradition appear to be yet another facet of the New Age. He mixes up Hindu, Christian, and Islamic ideas while complaining about New Age syncretism. He claims to have "transcended dogma" but does not "deny it." This is the same trick many New Age people assert they can do too. At no point does Upton see that there are problems and legitimate objections to some of his assertions, and he avoids venturing into any area that deals frankly with possible holes in either his approach or his argument. I would heartily recommend this book to people to watch a soi disant Traditionalist fall flat on his face. I am disappointed that SP, a publishing house that usually has high standards, went for this mess of a book. 
 This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.  Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale. 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 This pillow is EXTREMELY overrated!!  I have slept better on a cheap Walmart pillow. It did nothing for me or my husband after a week. The tag on the pillow itself says "100% polyester fiber" which is what is in your common $5.00 pillow. It does not say on the label "50% holofiber and 50% super slick fiber" as it advertises above. Its nothing more than a placebo and they hope you fall for it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! 
 The Netgear SC101 Storage Central device holds a lot of promise and offers a nice looking case design. In fact, I referred to mine as a "network toaster" since that is kind of what it looked like.  Unfortunately, "beauty is only skin deep" when it comes to this unit.   Netgear did get some things right--the ability to buy just the enclosure and add your own hard disks is great. Anyone who has worked on computers for some time will undoubtedly have some perfectly serviceable hard drives sitting around. This unit gives you the ability to put at least some of those drives to use.  Installation and use of the device--when it works, which it doesn't always do--are both easy and definitely geared to new and inexperienced computer users who just want something that works.  What Netgear missed with this device, however, is the ability for more advanced users (or people who have multiple computers with different operating systems) to take this device further. It offers no web based interface and no file sharing protocols outside of the proprietary software (for Windows 2000/XP only). This is a serious flaw to an otherwise great idea.  The hard drives are also loose inside the device when you install them. There's nothing to hold them in place or keep them stable other than some blocks of foam. I could see this leading to electrical shorting from the circuit board on the drive to the case and even serious disk damage in the event that this unit would fall. The interior of the case is also quite sharp, so watch out not to cut or slice yourself while installing drives (or taking it apart to see what's inside).  All things and limitations considered, I returned mine after five minutes of using it. It's just too limited for the power user, hobbyist or tinkerer. If you pay full retail price (~$100), it's also quite pricey for such a limited piece of hardware. If Netgear were to come out with a more powerful version that offered true network attached storage functionality, I'd certainly give serious thought to buying it. As it is right now, the product was an expensive disappointment to me 
 He bowed at a shinto shrine. He attends the Pagan rite at Bohemian Grove for the Cremation of Care. He belongs to the Order of Death also known as Skull and Bones. His wife says he milks male horses and that she enjoys male dancers.  Only the blind could think this is a description of a Bible believer 
 If you have ever installed an X-10 module then this book is a waste of your money.  I purchased this book based on the reputation of O'Reilly as a publisher.  But after reading this book I will not make that mistake again.   This book contains very basic X-10 information, so if you are intrested in exploring the use of X-10 for the first time this book might be interesting, but I think there are far better places to start.   Examples... Hack #1 discribes basic X-10 addressing, hack #2 tells you how to turn on a light.... What a joke.  Hack #88 "Streamline your Apple scripts"  Well, like 95% of the world this has no use to me... I use a PC.  Anothe Mac only hack is #91 which is using the mac iCAL program.  There is no PC version.  Hack #92 is for Charting... And you guessed it... It is for the MAC AGAIN! #93, MAC again...  So keep lookng this book not worth the money.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 would you buy a used contra from this man?  Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.  Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.  Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.  GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.  Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.  For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.  Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way. 
 Superficial, scattered with an odd smattering of references, this is one of the worst biographies that I have ever read. Ted Hughes deserves better 
 My senior year i had to pick this book for an economics project... bad choice. I do like how there are boxes placed every so often with little stories/parables/facts etc. thats pretty nice i'll say, but the rest is repetitive bi***in, depressing, whining information that does interest me in the least. i think i'm better off going and reading some harry potter books 
 This was a much anticipated and very disappointing reading experience.  Ms. Forrest is an excellent writer, but this latest effort should not be listed as a lesbian novel, nor as a romance.  It reminds you of the 50's when a lesbian character is thrown in for attention.  If Daughters of an Amber Moon had been the first book, then Daughters of a Corral Dawn would never have had to be written as a sequel because no one would have cared about the other group of women.  This is mainstream writing making money posing as lesbian literature.  The fact that Ms. Forrest is a lesbian does not make her writing lesbian.  In the last few years, her books have become more and more mainstream sanitized.  Daughters of an Amber Moon proves once again that you cannot buy a book just by the author's name.  Characters are not well developed and no one the reader identifies with or gets close to emotionally.  Writing skill is good.  Subject and characterization is not.  I would not buy this book again, nor recommend it to my friends 
 I tossed this book after plowing through only 100 pages of overwritten ponderous verbiage.  Like the barking dogs before an earthquake, I began to sense that a disaster of a book was shaping up.  As another reviewer has noted, this book sorely needed an editor.  There was no real action in the first 100 pages.  The characters, which Williams spends so much time "developing", were cliched.  As I read, I kept asking myself "when oh when is he ever going to get around the the earthquake?"  If a popular work of fiction doesn't grab me by page 100, I aint interested.  So, since there wasn't anything shaking by page 100, I just tossed the book and moved on.  You wanna read a fantastic apocalypse book, read "Earth Abides", instead.  
 I'm with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this.  As I have enjoyed many of Delinsky's other books, I expected a lot more from this.  I was not really engaged in the characters or the story, and found the first person format somewhat jarring for some reason 
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 This story starts out immersing the reader in a Klingon battle game, the rules of which are never clear. This opening only really serves to introduce the main characters of the book and is otherwise confusing and completely unnecessary. I almost put the book down because this section was so uninteresting. But it does pick up somewhat from there, when we follow Vrenn's life and his rise from humble beginnings to command a ship of his own. There are some interesting dynamics between the characters but as usual when dealing with Klingons, you're never quite sure who can be trusted or who will ultimately betray whom.  Nearly every bit of Klingon lore and culture introduced in this book has been contradicted by the "official" canon of later TV shows and movies, so it's not even really good as a peek in the Klingon way of life. Bottom line - unless you are passionately interested in all things Klingon, I would pass this book by 
 This dvd was supremely boring and only moderately informative.  Don't waste your time or money 
 I had hoped that Kellert would explore all the different ways that Biophilia might interact with the environmental design process with a view to uncovering new possibilities both in the built AND conceptual stages. Unfortunately the book just slowly scoops an uninspired selection of well-trodden sustainable practices into the Biophilia fold. I'm afraid I feel that the book is written too much in the cautious, repetitive & tautological style of Academic Sociology and is unable to take any vigorous conceptual jumps into new territory. The point of such leaps is to make connections with reasonably well-founded research in another field with a view to invigorating understanding (and design) on both sides of the jump. Kellert's association with Edward O. Wilson had led me to expect such daring, which drives every wonderful page of the latter's masterful "Consilience". Hildebrand's "origins of architectural pleasure" does at least bravely gather together many fields of study to create a new benchmark for linking basic epigenetic rules of human nature with architecture. I am hoping for a book that looks around for ways that architecture may explore the positive (rather than remedial) use of human nature in design. Maybe Kellert can write volume two in a more consistently pioneering form 
 This book certainly LOOKED fascinating. It was touted to me as a literary and wonderfully researched thriller focusing upon Vlad Tepes, and as such, I was expecting to enjoy it immensely.  But between five and ten pages in, I realised that reading it was going to be a chore, not a pleasure.  This was NOT because of the mediaeval history included in the book. (I found that one thing Ms Kostova did well was to weave her "history" in with the story.) It WAS, however, at least partly due to the fact that the much-vaunted historical research is... well, let's put it kindly. It's nonsense. Ms Kostova does not seem to realise how real historians work, and she strains credulity at one convenient "discovery" after another. She is utterly incorrect in details that can really annoy, such as saying "dialect of Church Slavonic" when any BASIC historian into this field knows Church Slavonic did not branch into various written dialects. Not only that, but the nonsensical inclusion of a "lost" Shakespearean play supposedly set in a Muslim city - please!  It's worth pointing out that Ms Kostova appears not to realise that the term "vampire" was NEVER applied to a nobleman, was not CURRENT as possibility among nobles, during the period in which Vlad Tepes flourished. Had it been, believe me, his enemies would have accused him of it - he certainly was accused of whatever his enemies could throw at him. The word "vampire" was not used in Greek theatre, although Ms Kostova states that it was. In fact, the word and concept of vampire (not Upir as a proper name) have as their earliest attestation a folk reference in the 15th century - in what's now Yugoslavia (the South Slavic area). The FIRST TIME that the peasant superstition EVER is turned around to refer to nobles is long, long, long after the time of Vlad Tepes. It is in fact a distinctly discernable process occurring in the Romantic period - Germany's Enlightenment in which writers like Goethe were creating erudite and genuinely chilling tales about this newly-"discovered" monster of legend. From there, it did not take long before the English got into the act and the first full-length works were written - both trash and treasure in quality.  So the mere IDEA of suspecting a nobleman to be a vampire is specifically 19th century, not mediaeval.  It seems that Ms Kostova didn't do her vampire research very thoroughly. There's a huge amount of truly fascinating material there waiting to be treated in a novel, but "The Historian" is not that novel.  And in terms of writing... Ms Kostova's style does not take wing. She writes about some gorgeous places in the world, and some fascinating events, but the details often annoy by being wrong, and the gorgeous places are not vividly drawn in front of our eyes. What I mean is this: a great writer does not say, "I was breathless and taken aback. It was magnificent. It was beautiful", and so on. Rather, he/she convinces us by our visualisation that the place is one of dizzying grandeur, astonishing beauty, etc. Don't tell us; show us - that is good advice to keep in mind.  The characters are so unclearly delineated that they all seemed to meld into one. When reading the so-called letters of John, the girl's father, his vocabulary, style, ways of thinking, etc., are all exactly the same as the writing of the girl, and the writing of Rossi.   The character of Dracula himself is the biggest disappointment. To learn that his secret great plan is (yes, believe it) to get hold of scholars so that he can make them his librarians because he wants his library catalogued... well, it's frankly ludicrous.  And what a fizzled-out finale. We never see Dracula's power - he is never frightening. In fact, chills and thrills were virtually entirely absent from this novel, whereas Bram Stoker's Dracula is genuinely psychologicalliy terrifying.  THIS Dracula is killed because he's distracted by someone else? He's killed by a quick shot from a gun with a silver bullet? Oh dear. Originality is not the hallmark here, nor is nail-biting tension.  The epistolary device does not work well here - there's simply no NEED for letters. The notion of letters doesn't even make sense, but Ms Kostova clearly used the device because she intended to draw out the story and use the end of a letter as an excuse to break off the story at one point, presumably to make the reader salivate for more. (Clearly she modelled the device upon its use in Stoker's novel - but there the device made literary and plot sense. Here... it doesn't.)  This novel, then, failed to captivate me. I finished it in a mood of grim resignation, determined to base my increasing uninterest in it upon a full knowledge of it, rather than to stop half-way. The style of writing is a little too prosaic to really merit being called "literary". The thrills that should have been there... weren't. The denouement was frankly silly. The characters did not leap off the page into my mind's eye. And the research was wrong in so many details that I cannot even begin to describe it. And this was annoying because those wrong details did not impact on the STORY - they could have been written with CORRECT information without negatively impacting on the novel. They were wrong, then, because Ms Kostova made assumptions and did not do the research she is vaunted to have done.  In short - disappointing 
 I managed to read The Breaker in one sitting, so it can't have been all that bad. But it was a pretty unremarkable story. There wasn't really much of a mystery to uncover. I had a major problem with the character of Maggie. What was she even doing in this story? Easily the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Making it worse was the fact she practically had nothing to do with the plot.  I have also read The Dark Room by Minette Walters, and found that one to be fairly average as well. She needs to work on her character development. Her writing style has more of a presence than her characters do. I doubt I will be picking up anymore by this author. 
 I've waited breathlessly for each book of this series to be published. I've been disappointed with a couple which focused on minor characters like class-fixated, boring Barbara. George's best books in this series have "starred" the Lyndleys and their best friends. Strong plots, interesting relationships, and intelligence  characterize these books, particularly the early ones.  This book is the worst of the series. Serial killers have been SO overdone, and George doesn't do them as well as other authors. Maybe George is simply tired of the characters. The ending shocked and revolted me.  What a dirty trick on George's faithful readers.   I don't think I'll buy more of her books. 
 The best word I could come up with to describe this book is...blah. There are so many loose pieces that are never tied together.  I would not recommend bothering with this book.  
 I should have hear other rater's advice...but then I've said to myself..."hey, it's a Sony, they wouldn't release such a bad product, or at least, they would stop selling it after 3 years" (the first review dates Feb 2004)...I already have 9 coasters and counting... Now, before I buy any Sony product, I say to myself: Don't buy it..It's a Sony.. 
 I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card.    It's possible that this card works well in other uses, but I found its performance unacceptable as storage for RAW images shot with my Canon Digital Rebel SLR.  Anywhere from 1/5 to 1/10 of the images were corrupted, particularly bad in continuous shooting mode.  Contrast with my Lexar Media 512 MB and 1 GB cards, which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions, and without as much of a lag time as the Viking card (often left waiting 15+ seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to "recovers") 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor. 
 if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 This, to me, is nothing but backround noise. I don't know how anyone can really be interested in this "music", there is nothing to be interested in. But, then again this is coming from a drummers perspective, and that may be bias, in a way that there is some sort of rhythm required for it to really catch my ear. So this may be for you if you have a really short attention span. Thank you, that is all. 
 After the brilliant "Going After Cacciato," this book severely disappointed me.  The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue hollow and unbelievable, and the plot laughable.  I had a hard time swallowing just about every scene.  I didn't like Tom, and not because he was obnoxious, but because he was such a broad stereotype with no depth.  R. Russo created an equally obnoxious protagonist (also a professor) in "Straight Man" who did some pretty loony things, yet I loved that book.  It rang true.  This book does not.  By the end, I did not cheer, I did not hiss.  I found I just didn't care one way or another for any of the characters 
 his idea was great for the book, alot of the stuff he says was well researched and correct, however, alot , especially when it gets to psychology , was outdated, and incorrect, and the book has alot of contradictions, once again, especially with the psychology parts, and his imprinting and mal-imprinting section contradicts things he says later on in the book, if you want to be better informed, skip this and go straight to actual psychology books , this is more or less a book for people who want to pretend to be intellectual, and just take anyones word on anything 
 Come on.  This is a book by Jim Belushi.  Need I say more 
 Mr. Jensen's "Brain-Compatible Strategies" was a disappointment.  His ideas were commonplace and uninteresting as was his writing.  A much better source for ideas is Mel Silberman's "Active Learning:  101  Strategies to Teach Any Subject.&quot 
 Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.  Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.  Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).  The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight.  Any airplane flight.  Like Chicago to Tokyo.  Or maybe Chicago to Peoria.  Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading.  As I got "into" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time.  Sometimes whole chapters.  Never lost the "plot" (what?), never missed the "sex scenes" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page "X+5" - not to worry).  Can't wait to skim his other books 
 I will not elevate this book to the status of a legitimate work of intellectual inquiry by writing a detailed critique of it.  Suffice it to say that the author, rather than citing objective evidence in support of her conclusions, does nothing except make baldly conclusory statements which conform to her ultra-feminist world view.  If Ms. Adams wishes to be a vegetarian feminist, that's her business.  But until she can come up with objective evidence that her hypothesis is true, she comes across as nothing but a rambling mad-woman.  Using the conclusory technique employed by Ms. Adams, I could easily write an equally legitimate book claiming that vegetarianism causes oppression of men worldwide.  Any publishers out there interested 
 Other reviews were right, The first disc was great the second froze up halfway thru the Son of Frankenstein... the disc was loose when I rcv'd it. and is useless junk 
 Spoilers ahead: I am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies, and totally enjoy a good B flick. But I have to say that this one was just terrible. There's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever, I just couldn't believe how stupid the main character really was!! How do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you? I mean come on!!! Breaking into the rangers office on site, no less, and getting drunk...all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her? Then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho. Was no one else shouting at the screen "Grab the cop's gun and shoot the psycho!" as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike.  And running infront of the truck, in the headlights... There was forest all around her and she never once went and hid, just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom. A sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it's misery in my opinion. No, it was simply unbelievable and I was relieved when the credits rolled. So glad I didn't actually pay the rental fee on this one 
 As a person who is on the verge of retirement, this is one of many investment and retirements books I've read recently.  If you take the author's advice in your retirement strategy many of the authorities on retirement planning would tell you that you will run out of money in a very untimely way!  Written near the end of the boom cyle of the 1990's the book suggests that you can safely withdraw 8% or more of your investments a year for living expenses.  This is an extremely optimistic approach.  Most current experts recommend a 4% or so withdrawal rate is much more realistic considering the long term analysis of the various markets.  This was proposed by the landbreaking research in the Trinity study, written several years before the publication of this book and has become the predominent thinking of modern investment advisors.    I especially was miffed at a short discussion suggesting that managing and reducing your living expenses was much less important than your investment strategy.  These two items go hand-in-hand and each has a vital place in retirement considerations.    You may wish to buy this book for it's decent discussion of the various investment markets, but there are far better out there.  This discussion was only fair.  I've found the books by Boggle and Berstein to be among the best.    If you should have the temptation of following the author's advice regarding spending habits and safe withdrawal rates from your investments, I would stongly recommend that you weight this against other expert advice on the subject.  
 There are hundreds of Self-Help books out there.  Some are useful.  This is not one of them.  The book is structured around five supposedly sequential parts: Part I Discover it [your gift], Part II Develop it, etc...  But, there is little substance to it.  The book is nearly 300 pages long, but each page tells the same thing: find out what you want to do, and do it.  It shares tens of biographical examples that have the same pattern: An individual overcame the odds of a miserable childhood to become most successful in life through determination.  The profiled characters include Lance Armstrong, Abraham Lincoln, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mother Theresa, and Mahatma Gandhi.  That's inspirational but not informational.    I judge a self-help book by its usefulness.  Does the author convey practical insights beyond the self-evident?  Is the advice original?  (Or, has it been stated many times before).  Has this book changed my perspective, attitude, and knowledge?  The response is no.   Let me recommend other books instead.  Unlike Souza who keeps you guessing, Marcus Buckingham allows you to readily identify your talents in "Now Discover Your Strength."  While Souza keeps you dreaming, Stephen Covey tells you concretely how to give your life purpose in "The Seven Habits of Effective People."   
 Since Michael Chabon endorsed this book and the author had won a place at Yaddo to write parts of it, I thought that I was in for a treat of a read, and yay! it was  450 pages of reading.  Well, yes and no. The book has a great premise -- ganglife and a new immigrant's experiences in 1880s New York -- but it waffles between a full-fledged historical novel (like Edward Rutherfurd's works) and the second draft of a literary work. If the author had taken on one of the genres, and fully explored that rather than trying to blend the two, perhaps this would have been a more satisfying read for me. It's definitely "readable" but doesn't live up to the accolades on the jacket.  But because I saw some moments of good storytelling and a good handle on the dramatic pace, I have hope the author's next work will be much improved over this piece 
 Dosn't work.  Still receving lots of auto-dialer calls.  Waste of money 
 My favorite baseball resource book each year was the Scouting Notebook. Sporting News discountined it this year and included a dumbed down version within the Baseball Register.   I can tell you I will never purchase this product again and I'm afraid Sporting News will think this new product is a sucess because Scouting Notebook purchasers probably purchased it but I'm sure they will not make that mistake twice 
 For the third time in as many books, Marcus Pfister passes along the lesson "Be nice to others."  That was the moral of the story in The Rainbow Fish; it was also the moral in Rainbow Fish to the Rescue.  Why Mr. Pfister felt it necessary to bludgeon the reader over the head with it yet again in Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale is truly beyond me.  It wouldn't really bother me - after all, there's nothing wrong with reminding children as well as adults that it's good to be nice - except the writing itself in Big Blue Whale is so poor.  As in Rainbow Fish to the Rescue, Big Blue Whale feels rushed and slipshod, as if the author threw together any old story in order to make a deadline.  Even a simple, predictable and cliched story can still be well-written and enjoyable; unfortunately, Big Blue Whale is all of the former and neither of the latter.  Save your money and stick to the original Rainbow Fish 
 This book is full of hate and racism on Kincaid's part. Would she have no tourists? What brings in the money?  She should be a part of the solution not continue the problem 
 I'll admit, there are some songs on here that I simply love.  Namely, "Theme" and "Bookstore".  But other than those two, the soundtrack is not good listening.  It doesn't flow well at all, songs like "Bookstore" going into a five minute, rambling "It's the Sun" and then to "Wada Na Tod".  It's not really pleasant to listen to.  It goes great with the movie, but you have to keep in mind that in the movie, a mind is being erased.  "Showtime" especially bothered me.  It works so well in the movie, but to just listen to it?  Doesn't work.  The soundtrack definitely sounds confused and broken, with a few songs of refuge.  Sadly, these songs (like the two I mentioned) are some of the shortest on the album.  ("Bookstore" clocks in at a paltry 52 seconds.)  I would not recommend this purchase based solely on the music.  Jon Brion is great, but it's just not good for listening.  If you loved the movie, like I did, and you simply want to experience it from a different perspective, you might be satisfied with this product.  Otherwise, watch the movie and skip this buy 
 How is it that an abundant and continually-growing body of testible and reproducible evidence (what we call real science) that continues to indicate conceptual errors to much of the biblical (old testiment), evangelicals and neo-cons continue to try to dilute science with pseudoscientific babble.   Non-sequiturs in relatively good presentations about the marvels of the universe suddenly are 'proof' that we could only be on this designed planet.  How one jumps from explaining the historical context of expanding discoveries of thousands of stars, to millions, to millions of millions of potential planetary systems to 'this is the only one created for life -- and us' seems to be turning a blind eye to the math suggestions that directly counter Ross' conclusions.  This isn't just pseudoscience, it is bad science.  In effect, the narration attempts to teach that science is about jumping to conclusions with little regard to facts.  That should be left to politics and religions.  It is all well-and-good to promote one's faith, but don't pretend that science is validating personal myths.  Woolly thinking of this nature insults both the faith and the science -- might pass for entertainment, 'though 
 I really enjoy Norah Jones. This CD was so bad I still haven't listened to the whole CD. Who wants the listen to the same 5 songs preformed 5 different ways? Most of the remixes are hip hop, not really Norah Jones' style. The best part of this CD is the cover artwork. If I could I would give this CD 0 star 
 This book would leave no untrained reader to think Saddam was a good guy or beneficial in anyway for Iraq. The book discusses the former Iraqi president (actually dictator) who killed massive amounts of Iraqi kurds, got hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed in an eight year war with Iran that Saddam mostly started and mentions Saddam's takeover of Kuwait. But Saddam is a creep whose bad activities can't be overestimated nor can they can they all be listed and this book doesn't mention how Saddam killed half million Iranians in that war or how much of Iraq went up in flames during that war or how Saddam bombed Tel Aviv with SCUD missiles as part of an attempt to start a whole war with Israel. Missing also is Saddam's second attempt at taking over Kuwait in 1994 plus his misbehavior that caused operation Desert Fox in 1998 plus the fact that Forbes magazine rated Saddam wealthiest man (on earth!) #5 in 1997 at five billion dollars personal fortune and money means power. All this means Saddam was a growing threat when he was taken out in 2003 and it was not just for Iraq but for the sake of much of the rest of the world. The book also fails to mention how Khadafi of Libya quit his own nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam get captured in 2003 by fearing that he (Khadafi) might the next to get captured should he not start behaving himself. An added huge benefit to Saddam falling. 
 Bears all the hallmarks of its author's self-congratulatory self-conception: vain, witless vulgarizing, power-celeb worship and sitcommish woodenness posturing as astute "irony" and relevant commentary. Utter garbage 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 The author of this book makes losing weight while nursing sound much harder than I found it to be. She sites studies which show nursing doesn't really help you take off the pounds, which is odd because most nursing resources tout easier weight loss as one of the benefits to the mother (and they site studies to back their conclusions, too).   She is also FAR too conservative in her idea of how much weight it's safe to lose while nursing. For the first six months, she says a one to two lb loss per month should be your maximum! If, like me, you gained a bit more weight than the recommended 25-30 lbs, that's downright depressing... and, I believe, inaccurate. According to La Leche League, after 2 mos. post partum you can safely aim to lose up to a pound a week with no adverse affects on nursing.    The other problem I have with this book is her pronoucements on nursing and sleep duration. She asserts that breastfed babies wake up more often at night than formula babies. I don't think that's necessarily true, as I know formula-fed infants who wake every 2-3 hours all night long and breastfed ones who slept a 6 hour stretch from birth. Worse yet, she says that breastfed babies won't sleep through the night until "well into the second year of life." That's CRAZY.  When your baby sleeps through the night depends on your child, your parenting practices, your sleeping arrangements and a lot of other variables--not just on what or how you feed them.   I'm so glad I didn't read this book with my first child, because the message is "breastfeeding = being chunky and sleep deprived for up to two years" and, not knowing better, I would have found that completely depressing. 
 This is a good book for serious health nuts that have the time and energy to make simple easy recipes with a million strange ingredients that you've probably never heard of. If you plan on making lots of baby food with kelp and sea weed then this is the book for you 
 This is the only textbook we used for our OS class at university. My interests lie in systems programming and some low-level interfacing using high level languages but this book really didn't help me much. I was looking forward to this subject but disappointed because the lecturer basically took this book as the bible and made no references to other sources. If this book was to create a religion and my lecturer was the pope then I wouldn't be surprised if there were so many factions like in Christianity...because of the confusing presentation of the subject. Half of the time I was consulting Google because of the nearly useless examples in the book. At one point I was arguing about a vaguely explained topic with my lecturer. I was using other texts as my references but unfortunately my lecturer was pushing his own interpretation of the topic 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.  In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature.  My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine.  Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.  Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one 
 A quick 136 page read is not all bad, however the author Jeffrey Gitomer, keeps telling us of Patterson's principles and then sends us to his (Gitomer) website to register for the anwser. I contend this is unauthentic marketing and a contradiction to Jeffery's claim of giving value. GIVE US WHAT WE PAID FOR AND THEN TRY TO SELL US. This is the perfect example of what not to do in sales. He assumes I have read his other books and that what he says is gold. Please give me what I pay for next time, if there is one.  
 This is the sort of insipid, derivative, trying-too-hard scenesterism that we need LESS of today. Not one song on here is entertaining in any way. It just goes to show what a big mortgage loan, handsome "vintage" equipment, "hip" clothing, and scenester connections can do for your lousy songs. Welcome to the big time, boys. 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 On his sophmore release Omarion proves he doesn't have what it takes to be a force in R&B. After two huge singles Entourage & the massive Ice Box, I expected a better alum which I didn't get. Omarion is a singer who needs strong production because he really lacks strong vocals. To his credit though that Omarion had truly surpassed his status as the former member of a boy band with his first release with this CD he's just another singer with a hit single 
 I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single bonus feature. You can only choose, "play main feature". Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. At least the VHS had closed caption. This DVD is sort of "just watch once and throw it to the garbage can" quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS  
 I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all 
 Libera has finally disappointed me. Their first two CD's were excellent (Libera & Luminosa). Their third slipped a little (Free). Visions has hit rock bottom. The album title is misleading. There is no vision about the music, or the direction the album has taken. There is about as much life, or excitement in the songs as watching paint dry. With the exception of Wings of a Dove, which is the highlight of the album and a few others (which I will mention later), all the songs are very slow, somber, and reflective without any spark to them. We are the Lost, however, is very sincere and emotional. To show how "tired" the album is, they have included at least two songs, Locust Iste (Sanctus) and Libera from previous albums. Locust Iste (Sanctus) is now making it's third appearance. They have also included two classics, Prayer, and Abide with Me, whose arrangements fall flat of the orginal. I can find no fault with the boy's voices, they're all excellent, but the material is without "vision" . As an aside, on the Young Classical Performers website, there is an excellent song called "Tomorrow Shall be My Dancing Day", this is by far the best song Libera has performed. It is an uplifting song with a lot of energy. When will we see it on one of their albums, instead of Sanctus and others which are continually redone.  
  I agree with other reviewers who said that Feinstein would've been better off following one team instead of all of them.  This could also chop the length down to a more reasonable amount.  There's just too much going on to remember everything.  I didn't even finish the book because it just took too long to get to the end and it didn't seem like the end would ever come.  Feinstein could've told this story in about 250 pages instead of almost twice that.  Not terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it 
 It took me almost a year of off-and-on reading to finish this book. In most stories, there is at least one character that you can identify with - even if it isn't the author's intended goal. In this book, they are all pathetic losers on a fast track to Nowhere Land. To call this a monumental work is laughable. The story moves like sludge until the very end, then becomes simply forgettable. If you enjoy being abused with other people's dysfunctions, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother 
 Dear lord, this is one of the most tedious books I have read in ages.  I generally love the Chick Lit genre, but this book is just annoying.  I find the writing boring and tedious and often quite juvenile.  The character is completely self-absorbed and a whiny...  Blech, it's really quite awful 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 Some of these essays are familiar, and are no fresher in their reprinted form in this volume.  Crowley's polemics are tiresome and her remarks about the role of first-year writing courses in the college curriculum are  neither radical nor particularly useful.  I can imagine educators cheering  at certain portions of this volume, but the after-effect is that it was  merely another exercise in reading, an occasion for an author/educator to  "vent" spleen on the profession.  It's hard to admire this work 
 There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography.  The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate.  The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book.  The photo on the front was the best part 
 I got this book to learn how to survive  and live in the wilderness. To be honest other than making a bow which is so complicated and tanning deer hide, I didnt learn anything. It didnt go into any depth on any survival skills. Dont waste your money if you want to learn anything. This book is for people who already have a basic skill. 
 The film is well crafted, but I do take issue with the racial tones of the storyline. Stop making 'race' an excuse.   People get out of life what they put into it. This should have been a story of human triumph instead of some run of the mill sociopolitical statement. There is waay too much of this happening today.  My appologies to the production crew, but 1 out of 5 stars is all this movie deserves.       
 This novel gives a strong portrayal of the vast inequities between the entitled rich and the poor, working class in India, but beyond that the plot is very loose and unwieldy. It is really just an account of a few months in the life of a sari shop salesperson and the people he meets and the experiences that befall him. Some of the things that happen - like he winds up unknowingly being the model for a character in a book - make me wonder if they were ever intended to have more significance later on in the story - something to tie all the experiences together in the end. But this never happens, and the tale ends as randomly as it begins. I wasn't left wanting more, but it felt like something was missing 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing.  
 When I bought mine there was no reviews. I have the same problems as the other reviewers have. Feathers poking through. I was suckered by the low price. Stay far away from this product 
 So i really hate this book... it give maybe one example of certain concepts and they are not even that descriptive.  i might just be use to my other math books... but coming from a girl who is a math major, i would stay away!! 
 This is not a good album. I dont know who is doing the beats but it is not good at all the flow is straight garbage, But Yo I can review this u cant, I know hiphop you dont, you are a fagg your Momma should of swallowed the nut that went up in ya Mom's stankin azz pussy, but you know what, f.ck you you dont like hiphop and I dont like you so f.ck you.

 I really think I wasted money for buying this stuff.....it's just worthless and not working at all. 
 Now, I'll admit to leaning libertarian myself, but I really really did try to give this book a chance.  But at the end of the day, the book is an attack without an argument, and with very little analysis.  The book is premised on the idea that practically everyone in the tech industry is a "libertarian"... which, in the author's caricature, means some sort of selfishness-celebrating Ayn Randroid.  As far as I can tell, she's not very familiar with libertarian ideas (against which there are various good arguments to be made... but she apparently didn't care to learn enough about the ideas to make them) and mostly resorts to amateur psychologizing, and insinuating that libertarians are just nasty people.  What facts do make it into the book aren't even very carefully checked (she says something about the Cato Institute having been around since the 60s...)      So I guess if you already dislike libertarians and want something to chuckle along to, this is OK.  If you want a serious critical examination of (and attack on) libertarian ideas, though, try Will Kymlicka's "Contemporary Political Philosophy" which has a chapter on them.  This little tome is about as reasonable as a Rush Limbaugh screed.  Or maybe those Jack Chick religious pamphlets which show liberals scheming about how to destroy Christianity through satanic rock music 
 I am sorry.. I just could not take this album. There are no hooks, nothing grabbing.. Just forlorn, dull, constantly repeated themes.. And, this has been a problem with the past few albums. It's one thing to live through tragedy and loss.. but, moaning about it over the same open chords gets old for an entire album.. There is just no closure, it seems. Look at all the great albums dealing with loss- Springsteen's "The Rising", Lou Reed's "Magic and Loss", Patti Smith's "Gone Again" and "Tramping", etc, and they all have some closure and moving on.. This doesn't.. it's like listening to some old drunk lady at the bar rattle on and on about how miserable she is, and that gets old really quick..  I see people ranting here about "Come On".. that song is by far the worst song I have heard from her.. It sounds like a reject from Steve Earle's El Corazon album.. 
 This book is beyond mildy boring. It's easy to spot the 'plot twists' several chapters before they occur. All her jokes center around one-theme that isn't funny from the start. I recommend it only if you're looking for a cheap read that doesn't require any thinking. I was very disappointed 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 Easy audience in dumb Irish American lobby.  Sands was a terrorist thug and his writings the work of an evil man.  Why are people in this country so quick to support terrorists in Ireland?  Don't you remember the Oklahoma  bombing?  Sands and McVeigh are cut of the same cloth 
 This was the last Sedaris book I read, and I guess I was just spoiled by his other works.  Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.  His fictional offerings are a bit useless.  The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality.  When this translates to fiction it loses its validity.  There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism.  Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.  The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction.  Go read "Naked" or "Dress Your Family in Cordury and Denim".  His later works are far superior to this 
 I have read a few things by Lattimore, and while he is touted as the most accurate translator of Greek literature, I find him increadibly difficult to read. His sentences sometimes make no sense at all.  English is a language that depends upon syntax and the order of words in a sentence; Greek is not this way, it is a language with myriad declensions and conjugations, effectively allowing its poets to manipulate a sentence's word order.  Lattimore may simply be too accurate to the Greek originals, because the word order--translated so precisely--simply does not fit well in the English. I recommend Fagles, who is an amazing translator; and while he is accurate, he also understands the limitations of translating the Greek to English. His sentences are fluid and capture the life of the translation. For Aeschylus, I also recommend Philip Vellacott. Check out Fagles, then check out Vellacott. But please forego the Lattimore translations, unless you really want to understand just the sort of impact a bad translation can have. 
 I did not feel this book provided anything that the new real life entry level investor needs.I thought this would be informative information that would have real value, but instead got a collection of stories. It was like a collection of stories to help the investors that have already made it, but not the real stories to prevent the everyday small investor from making the entry level mistakes 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.  I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.  If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.    The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...  Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.  Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.  (2) Anna Faris...I can't decide whether I think she's really cute or if she's just a Plain Jane with large eyes...but when I'M thinking she's pretty cute, she's nice to look at.  
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 The sub-title of this book is very misleading. It does not contain "an action-oriented approach" to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. The book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page ("One of the things I dislike about myself is...", "One of my emotions I have trouble accepting is...") and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. For some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper.  Sure, completing sentences technically counts as an "action". But if you're like me, "action-oriented" implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world, not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts. For someone with social anxiety the last thing I needed was more solitary introspection.  Branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy; but alas, the practice helped me in no way. Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 A humorous account of another young 60s counter-culturist who was enlightened as a young man by hookers, opiates and SE Asian narcotics that "opened his eyes" to the "goodness and purity" of the Khmer Rouge, Viet Cong, Ho Chi Minh, Pathet Lao, "French enlightenment" of the Souteast Asian barbarians of the 19th century, and of course last but not least~ the absolute horrendous barbarity of the hegemonic & demonic US regimes that failed to truly understand these great organizations of the 50s thru 70s (yawn...).  He waxes on and on about his great acquaintences of Phnom Penh's and Hue's opiate dens as this "illustrious journalist" of the vaulted 4th Estate.  Pretty pathetic writing overall as I waded through all the despot worshipping until it just got way to sycophantical.  Saloth Sar, Ta Mok, Ieng Sary and General Giap would have loved to have Mr Swain nearby at nap time ........ :)   If you loved John Kerry's tired anti-Vietnam War fantasies, you will love Mr Swain's opiate dreams book immensely! 
 Interesting book if interested in author. His claim to have Hepburn at his beck and call until he found someone "better" sounds a bit self serving in light of the fact Hepburn never mentioned the supposed affair to any of her friends according to Barry Paris' book on Audrey. Could it be that Ben is a legend in his own mind 
 Shoppers beware: The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders: 1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled. 2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out. 3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them  
 the  original   book  was  great I purchased it many years  ago but  this   book   was  a poor  zerox  copy   of  the original  and  some  of  the type  could  not  be  read  to  the extent it   was  not  worth keeping  so I sent  it  bac 
 I've never seen a more poorly edited and proofread book.  It is full of typos, misspellings, poor grammar and punctuation, repetitions, and contradictions.  The writing style and content are simplistic.  Each chapter contains a few paragraphs about a specific topic.  The last few paragraphs of the chapter are a summary of what she just said.  And then there is an outline version of the same thing - three repetitions.   The author doesn't seem to have ever tried to use an online dating site herself.  She makes mistakes describing the sites and how to use them.  Once she tells readers not to post a photo.  A few pages later she says the opposite.  She advises readers to stick with e-mail communications for a month before initiating phone contact.  Then she advises another month of phone conversations before arranging to meet in person - two months before the pair ever gets to lay eyes on each other.  She condones lies about age, weight, height, and location.  "Online Dating for Dummies" is a much better resource.   
 This book was AWFUL - I tried to use it to prepare for the SAT II and was appalled at the out of date questions, as well as the sample tests, which test you on subjects absolutely irrelevent information 
 This is the story of a bad brotha from Oakland who comes to L.A. after his brother is murdered. He later finds out that his niece gets "forced" into porno and later murdered. He then sets out to murder everyone directly involved, from a porno actress (Pam Grier) to a theater owner (Ed Cambridge) to a man he looked up to as a child (Rudy Challenger) to a mobster (Don Diamond). Don't be mistaken, the Bernie Casey character is not a nice person. He treats women like crap and kills without conscience. This film is not in the class of "Superfly", "Shaft" or "The Mack", but it's entertaining. I was in high school when this film came out and I saw it on the big screen back then (1972) 
 I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record 
 Books on the subject of pro wrestling are coming out in great quantity these days. A few are great, many are so-so, and some are disappointing. I hate to say this book is one of the disappointments; I love the idea of a pro wrestling "book of lists," I've even known enthusiasts who have considered trying out the idea. "Wrestling's Most Wanted" delivers list after list of stage names, family combos, gimmicks... the categories themselves are interesting, but the examples give little interesting information other than citing who used what gimmick, who uses which finishing hold, etc... I doubt the author really knows a lot about pro wrestling; it seems like he merely collected a book's worth of information and tossed them into a book. Maybe those who know nothing about the pro wrestling biz might enjoy some of the newfound information in these lists; if so, kudos to the author for turning newbies into possible fans. If you are, on the other hand, a wrestling fan who is only even ankle deep in your pro wrestling studies and initiation, you are much better off purchasing the autobiographies of Lou Thesz, Mick Foley and Dynamite Kid 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 This book did not help me at all...the content was ok but the strategies sucked and I ended up getting a 2 on the exam. It just gave 2 pages for strategies and it did not have practice questions at the end of each chapter like other books do. Use 5 steps to a 5 (a quarter of the book is about strategies), my friends used it and they said it was soo helpful. Also, this book says 06-07 version but it has been the same for 3 years (i saw the 2003 book in the library). Please take my advice and dont buy this book 
 This milk is advertised as "vanilla" milk. But its regular white milk 
 Irons tries to argue that the imperial presidency is somehow tied to American imperialism abroad.  But he never makes his case; instead, he rants and raves about presidential actions he dislikes while ignoring those which contradict his view.  For example, he argues that presidents before Polk all followed to the letter the Constitution's grant of declaring war to Congress - no unilateral presidential war-making.  But in fact, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both undertook military actions without the consent of Congress.  Is there a difference between those small wars and others? Irons never tells us.  Irons doesn't uncover anything new or make any original arguments.  Don't buy it 
 I absorb "foodie" books at the rate that some breathe.  Reichl, Bourdain, Child, Buxton and others are the source of hours of fond distraction from my too-busy-to-do-anything life and my aspirations to understand food the way I understand my professional work -- intuitively, technically and personally.  I had read that this book was more of a bawdy personal history than others, but I always adore the personal details of the writers, and am hardly a prude. Nevertheless, I could hardly muster an ounce of empathy for the gratuitous sexual self-objectification of the author who viewed restaurants more as stars in a social strata than producers of cuisine.  I did not care about her tortured relationship with a porn star, whom she fed and bedded on her employer's dime.  I grew exasperated as she ended a chapter about three marriages with a confession that she wrote it without understanding the point, and still, after writing it and choosing to include it in her book, she did not.  The simple reality is that a writer is speaking to a reader, and Ms. Green's reader appeared to be...Ms. Green.  While it is apparent that others enjoyed this book, I would suspect that a day with "Garlic and Sapphires" would disabuse anyone of the notion that this is a delightful memoir, and instead expose it for the indulgence that it is 
 Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media.  This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot.  Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2.  The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.  All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment.  For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one 
 The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why 
 Richard Rothstein is no more qualified to advise on education than the new governor of California  (who is a body-builder).  The  objective of education is economic self-sufficiency.  Getting ahead in life requires connections, not "knowledge."  American blacks are denied connections.  We all  know why and how.  The black-white gap which Rothstein writes about  is not  information but access.    Valuable  knowledge is learned on the job, not in school. Teachers do not control access, employers do.  Blacks who are told otherwise are being cheated.    Centuries ago schools were for the elite, whose privileged  positiion in life was predestined.  This was not changed by free public schools.  America's political leaders never learned this fundamental lesson.   US Grant  - who in fact  liberated blacks - imagined blacks would quickly join mainstream   America.  KKK put an end to that dream.  Just saying again and again that there is a gap does not  acknowledge the reality.  Ask a bona fide teacher.  When black youth knows  schooling will be rewarded, education will command respect.  Wallace F. Smith,  Walnut Creek, C 
 Tonight is My time for reviewing "Millenium Best of's" from Family Acts (see Debarge, Jets), This One is an abject failure on many fronts:  Who chose these Songs?!  Some are Good, but why Three Marie Solo Tunes and None from Donny?  Where is "A little bit Country", "On the Shelf", "Aint nothing like the real thing", and others?  This 12 Song format should have worked well for this Duo (although they could certainly fill a 20 Song Best of respectfully), yet it's completely botched, Haphazard; Stupid Collection that insults those that Appreciate Donny and Marie, Avoid this untill the Record Companies get it right.. 
 A disclaimer: I did not complete this book.  Got about halfway and lost interest.  This book is both boring and trite, and frankly doesn't shed much light on why the conferacy continues to facinate so may people in my opinion.  In this case you can actually judge the book by its cover - the ugly guy on the cover is a good indication of what you will read in this book - a sordid story. 
 now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no "Dangerously in Love". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me. Aside from the obvious car banger  "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly popular "Love"(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me.  Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon 
 Don't order this item or anything from Mercantilla Inc. The product was a different color than advertised, it was missing three important parts, without which you can't use the bench, and many of the other parts were damaged. I've never had this many problems from any of Amazon's sellers. This was supposed to be my Holiday present, but it turned out to be a real disappointment.  
 I am so accustomed to raving about Kate Bush's recordings that it really pains me to write this one. This CD, while not horrible, is very disappointing. It seems she got sick of making interesting, quirky music and decided to just make some money with this one. It is very commercial, ridiculously over-produced and just could not have come from her heart. If you are a fan, you already own this. If you are looking for an introduction to Kate's music, buy "Hounds of Love". That CD is her masterpiece; "Red Shoes" should be veiwed as an asterisk in her amazing career 
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 I had never heard of Wilbur Smith, but he was recommended to me by friends in South Africa. At the airport I looked for one of his books and found many. All about 1000 pages long with embossed covers signaling bodice rippers. With a ten hour flight ahead, I thought, what the heck, give it a try.   The first impression proved accurate. What a silly, inconceivable story which can never seem to find a focal point. The three Courtney heros are gods on earth. They speak in a matter of months whatever language they come in contact with (including Arabic and obscure African dialects), they are amazing fighters who succeed in shaking off injuries more rapidly than a professional wrestler, they have an aura of command, even at age 10 or 17 that shames the most seasoned captains, they are great lovers (of course) etc. Good Lord! What two dimensional, predictable characters. And what a complicated, never-ending collection of ridiculous epic romances.   I will leave Wilbur Smith in the future to my South African friends (he is, after all, a South African, though he now lives, I understand, on the Isle of Maurice)and to the airport book stores.  Out of curiosity, I scanned the 91 reader reviews found on the Amazon site. Only 4 of the 91 seem to share my low opinion of this lightweight attempt at a good adventure story. Which confirms that Mr. Smith knows how to write for his public. And can afford exile from his native land. Which he richly deserves! 
 "Whitehead" doesn't refer to something on the face.  Although, like puss spewing therefrom, the book is a morass of grotesque prose.  What is Whitehead getting at that so many scholars seem to ignore completely?  At the core of Whitehead's philosophy is "bifurcation of nature."  From this, Ph.D's have waxed eloquent and stated, "Aha, Whitehead is a panentheist," meaning, the universe contains a god like a spirit in the body.  Hmmmm.  Modern democrats espouse an unusually similar theory that cannot be coincidence.  Nevertheless, everyone has missed the point.  First and foremost, to his credit, Whitehead had great command over mathematics and modern ideas in science.  More noteworthy is the fact that quantum mechanics (micro physics) and relativity theory (macro physics) cannot be reconciled (unless we use Hermann Weyl's guage theory, which implements methods from group theory, which is nothing but mathematical formalism and reconstruction with no physical meaning).  The theories are irreconcilable since relativity predicts via E=mc squared that an electron, which approaches the speed of light, must approach infinity.  Yet, the physical fact is that an electron is of finite weight (although, I think a clue to this problem is in nuclear fission, aka the fact of the atom bomb).  Whitehead resolved to accept that both quantum mechanics and relativity theory are both true, or rather, complete unto themselves for the domain of physical phenomena they addressed, and resolved to accept they cannot be reconciled.  This resolution is formulated in his fundamental hypothesis about the bifurcation of reality.  Case closed 
 i did not purchase this book.  hopefully i was not billed for it. if so please credit my account. thank you. william h. brown jr 
 A beginers guide to convection ovens.  Some very basic receipts for everyday meals, but does not have receipts one might use when entertaining guests 
 After having made very positive experiences with the lonely planet travel guides we also bought the one on Ireland. But this one was really a waste of time and money. The recommendations are out of date, some of the B&Bs recommended in the book are probably the worst in town and the city descriptions are absolutely useless.  Following the lonely planet we missed some really very nice spots (as we found out later) and spent some nights in very sleazy B&Bs.  Every other travel guide will do a better job. 
 ...I was bored.  This despite some top-notch performances (especially Sean Bean); costumes, settings.  The actress playing Clarissa merely came off as a self-rightous little prig.  You're not supposed to feel relief when she dies, but I sure did.  She's not very pretty either, so the attraction or lust that Lovelace felt was inexplicable -- I guess corrupting her absolute innocence and strong morals were the real attraction...yet despite his dastardly deeds, I felt more pity for Lovelace.  The story does drag a bit; don't let the rave reviews fool you.  It's worth seeing for Sean Bean and several of the supporting performances but the story moves too slowly and is on the whole a very depressing one.      
  Yes, this is the great PBBB 1st album (actually, the 2nd, see below), but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 2nd album "East West") is the one to get.  It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.  Ditto for "Pigboy Crabshaw" & "In My Own Dream"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports!  Also: Don't miss the "Original Lost Elektra Sessions" CD, which was the real first PBBB album, recorded before this one.  There is some fabulous music on that CD, and the liner notes by Paul Rothchild are worth the price alone 
 The authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history.  They especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic, healing, or toxic qualities.    Only trouble is, I find it hard to trust the authors' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas.  For example, they claim that Henry VIII had syphilis, passed it on to his children, and therefore none of them lived past infancy.  Ummm...except for the *three* who grew up to rule England?  And in a table of plants sacred to various Greek goddesses, they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to Hera, but do not connect it to Persephone at all, which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth.  Then, they go on to talk about witches' flying ointments and how deadly they were--but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance.  There may very well be treasures in this book.  I'd just be too afraid to trust the authors' accuracy 
 I began reading this book quite a few years ago but elected to stop after forty pages.  It is aimless, vile, and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Be warned: this is one you'll be ashamed to put in the garage sale...if you don't decide to just set it up in flames and put it out of its misery first 
 Dover reopened in Greek Homosexuality (1978) the study by classicists of a subject disdained since 1933, when Hitler crushed the German Homosexual Emancipation Movement.  However, Sir Kenneth denigrated Greek pederasty by claiming that it was merely lustful.  He hypercritically refused to use sources dating from after the 4th century - even Plutarch's Lives, which, like the works of Lucian and Diodorus, notoriously cited and paraphrased lost classical sources, which themselves often relied on earlier oral and written accounts.  This simplified the crotchety don's task and distorted his conclusions.  His "book" is really a collection of four essays.  The longest and most original are about erotic vases and a seamy lawsuit involving a kidnapping.  How such a skimpy selection of sources could be expected to yield a valid thesis defies reason.  Nicknamed "Bend-over Dover" by undergrads, Sir Kenneth, unlike so many other Oxfordians, seems never to have experienced a homosexual act, except once when, according to his autobiography, he was buggered while on military duty in Alexandria and complained that it hurt.  He was led astray by his intended collaborator, the Canadian shrink Devereux, who taught him the distorted Freudian thesis that homosexuals are sexually retarded, i.e., that we don't fully mature from the oral and anal phases to the phallic.  Sir Kenneth's homophobia was well documented a few years ago by James Davidson in the February 2001 issue of Past and Present.  "The Prosecution of Timarkhos" takes up 100 pages (19-109) - one half of the text.  It is an extended commentary, a specialized task at which Dover is a master.  The best things about the book are the illustrations, the analyses of the vase paintings, and the 30 pages of appendices 
 This book started out well, although the disfigured model theme has been done already, and done much better by other authors.  The thing that killed this book for me was the overuse of the word "egregious" which became such a nuisance to me that I couldn't finish the book.  The author uses the word in places where it shouldn't be used, as if she doesn't know the meaning of it but liked the sound.  Teenagers who wouldn't have this kind of vocabulary use this word constantly in this book.  I'm also displeased by her depiction of both women and men as sexual objects and nothing else.  All in all, disappointing 
 Please do not support this release of Cassavetes' films by Criterion Collection.  Purchasing this DVD set constitutes a denigration of real criticism and suppresses the appreciation and comprehension of true art.  The troubling circumstances leading up to the release of this edition (in which world-renowned Cassavetes critic Ray Carney was snubbed and fired after his work was completed) are absolutely pathetic and embarrassing for both Criterion and Miss Rowlands.  
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 This is one of the best ways to add a major security hole in your network.  The MVP allows full filesystem list and read access to the entire computer running the media server.  There is no way to disable this "feature".   Also, the remote interferes with my Phillips television (most manufacturers test their IR scheme for interactions to prevent this sort of thing).  although it looks like it should, the mvp does not have any hardware display.  it also does not show song names from internet radio streams and requires streams to bounce through your computer.      my experience with tech support was not good either 
 This textbook is a decent summary of the various family life cycle issues.  However, the authors' obvious political biases and leanings interfere with a balanced perspective and with the content of the book.  Several people in my master's level class found the book to be biased and unhelpful in certain areas. 
 I was really excited when I saw these reading glasses that split at the nose bar, how nifty, just wear them looped over the back of your neck and click the lens part together whenever you have to read the fine print.  Great idea, but the execution of the idea is not for everyone.  The back piece is also hard plastic, rigid, and if you have long hair, you have to lift them out from under your hair and place the plastic back strip at your mid-skull level, fit them on your ears and then fit the front parts together and snap.  From the back you end up looking like you are wearing an external orthodontic apparatus.  I'd like to see the company put a string in place of the hard plastic that loops around your neck.  The magnetic clip that brings the two lenses together in the front is a fabulous idea, and having the two lenses hanging off to the sides instead of a whole pair of glasses swaying across your front is so much more comfortable and out of the way - it's just the rigid frame at the back that makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they were mass manufactured 
 I purchased this as it said it was enhanced with music; it is not enhanced with music, just ocean surf sounds 
 The quality of the pictures need significant improvement. As an artist you need all possible details for the best results 
 This book is awful!  It is the worst D&D book I have ever read.  The plot is slow, confusing, and boring.  The characters have no focus.  I could not even finish reading the book because it was so bad.  Troy Denning has written some good stuff in the past but he has lost his touch with this series 
 This book looks to be an in-depth expose of the lives of presidents since Kennedy.  However, it quickly turns into a anti-Democrat and Clinton-bashing book.  Johnson is portrayed as a compulsive liar and serial adulterer and Carter is described as a disingenuous hypoctite.  Reagan, on the other hand, is portrayed as a nice man who was a wonderful human being.  While this may be true, it is worth noting that this is the same man who lied to the American people about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal and who left office with the worst budget deficit and highest unemployment rate in American history.  This man also declared war on the world power that is Granada and bombed that country back to the Stone Age.  The auther seems enthralled by Reagan and repeatedly describes him as a great communicator (which he was) and a man who could make you feel good.  Of course Reagan could do these things...he was an ACTOR!  That is what actors do!  The worst part of the book is the end.  Kessler wrote this piece in 1995, just over 3 years into the Clinton presidenc.  Yet, criticism of Clinton dominates the book and is almost 2.5 times as long as the chapters on Reagan, Johnson, and Nixon who each served over 4 years.  Kessler condemns the press for not investigating Clinton's lies about his philandering and makes the case that since Clinton can't keep his Billy in his pants he is unfit to be president.  If that were the ultimate judge of a man's ability to govern a country, most of the world's countries would be left without a leader.  Also, U.S. presidents throughout history have had mistresses: Jefferson, Cleveland, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Roosevelt among others.  The fact is this book does not reveal any bombshells about president's secret lives; all it reveals is Clinton's healthy extramarital sexcapades.  Clinton-haters should love this book, though there are better books available on the subject 
 I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.  The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).  The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.  The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).  The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.  However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.   Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.  Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.   The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.  For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.  I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.  So, I give it two stars. *Yawn 
 This book is the last straw for me.  I'm an ardent fan of JG's since the Clayborne brides.  Heartbreaker and Mercy were quite good and I expected better stuff from then on.  Instead, we get the same predictable setting and prototype characters.  She seems to want to write a book of all the Buchanan brothers.  Very,very disappointing thus far.  Murder List was excruciating and when I thought that things couldn't get worse, she comes up with Slow Burn.  I'd wish she'd just write Noah Clayborne's book and be done with the whole series.  Hopefully, she'd write a great book for Noah Clayborne 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 I am an Oil professional - 30 years in drilling and production. This book is very timely - we are running out of oil - All the major oilfields are in decline. New (significant) oilfields are not being found. As this progresses it will be a very big change of life.  The author repeats and repeats the same ideas with few facts. Saudi keeps it technical information private. I was disappointed with this book. : 
 I needed a book to give an efficient overview of SQL as used with the JDBC.  This book has not suited my needs.  In the "Why I Wrote This Book" section of the Introduction, the author says "There are many good books on SQL, but almost all focus on interactive SQL..."  As far as I know, SQL is SQL whether it is used interactively (queries entered directly by end-user) or from application code.  Also, this book contains way too much Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server specific SQL, not the makings for a database-independent Java application 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I think this book has good and bad points. He goes on about being able to manifest anything, but the prerequisite seems to be being a Christian, even though he implies this very subtly. I think he has the right intentions,  but this book is really just a long-winded way of expressing the whole  'wishful thinking' epithet. And one can do that without spending money 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 My view is skewed.  I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve Çoonts a few times as a B/N.  His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye.  People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it.  Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin.  While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book.  So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try. W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71 
 We bought this toy for my little neice for Christmas - what a let down! The toy looks easy enough to put together on both the instruction sheet and the photo on the box but in reality this thing is very confusing and nearly impossible! The slots to insert the sticker back and the clear plastic are so tiny - we used tweezers and still could barely do it! Once you think you've figured out how to get the paper and stickers and plastic together, you've used half of each roll and there are not additional rolls included, nor can you buy them separately! There is an internal piece that just doesn't fit once the stickers were in place - this toy is ridiculous. It is such a cute idea, but three adults spent over an hour trying to put it together and we finally gave up. Such a disappointment to a litle girl on Christmas morning!!! 
 Be carful where you place it...MUST be put in a shady place or it reads crazy! Hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously can't be seen at night 
 After reading this book you will realize this guy doesnt know what he is talking about. Very close minded and not open to any changes. At the end you will be like whatever 
 Hmmm...A little more research needed here perhaps. The connection between Nationalism and Nichiren has some validity but not the Nationalism we associate with Fascism or Racism or War. Patriotism or a love of country would be a more correct assertion. The connection with Shinto has some validity also since the Meiji restoration with a military Government physically imposed a Shinto Talisman as a controlling head of the Nichiren organisation. They had little choice but to follow orders, however quoting Nichiren as being of Shinto mentality himself is factually incorrect and very much opposed to his  fundamental beliefs in Buddhism.  
 Just about everyone has known a woman like Ms. Headley.  (Insecure and dramatic, EVERYTHING happens to HER!) Ms. Headley tries to pass her self off as a madcap Lucille Ball type (Wah! My skirt ripped!!!) Instead, she comes off as "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" part II -- needy and promiscuous, willing to sleep with anyone. Her narcissistic navel gazing is tedious and the dialogue contrived.  Don't even bother taking this book to the beach.   
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 Written okay, but I mean REALLY! Why not saint the individual who is the subject of this book? Perhaps he could walk on water to among all of his other suprahuman qualities???? If you take the time to read the reviews here - all by people who are wannabe Indians and/or haters of their own heritage and race, you'll get a very distorted view of what this book contains - which is a record of brutality, sadistic butchery, and mindless aggression against other peoples, until of course, elements like the Texas Rangers and US Army took the starch out or fight out of said noble Red Aristocrat. This sort of quasi-sob story type of literature (proliferating these days) dealing with people and events of the past really are annoying. Much better books are Cremony's LIFE AMONG THE APACHES, Utley's INDIAN WARS, and also SCALP DANCE, all available here at amazon.co 
 If you don't enjoy baseball at all, then you won't enjoy this movie 
 Four months after purchase, the Receiver misfunction and shut down. It was impossible to contact Sherwood Electronics which had no service Centers in the State of Wisconsin. Therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on. Check out  a Sherwood Service center in your state prior to purchase 
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!   
 This is a good book, but certainly not a great one.  I was lead to believe from newspaper reviews that this would be a "good read", a history book with a compelling narrative that would be hard to put down. Instead it is a rather dry mixture of high school history (lots of names and politics, often somewhat confusing) with a narrative that never really becomes compelling.  The beginning is a dry mini-history of the Persian Empire, then of Sparta, then of Athens. It finally picks up momentum about half way through when the actual wars start. Even then,though, the narrative continues to get bogged down and never really becomes a good story; with few exceptions it feels like  you are reading some student's term paper. If you are not in love with history to start with, this book will certainly not turn you on to the subject. On the other hand, the story itself is so fascinating it almost compensates for the weaknesses of the book 
 Investment Biker: 1-1/2 stars, just barely escapes the lowest possible rating.  This is a book about what a Tom Wolfe-style Master of the Universe does on holiday. It's nearly impossible to have an "adventure" when you are carrying 10(!) platinum credit cards. He got cold and wet a few times, worried about finding gas, didn't always have hotel rooms up to his standards, and had delays at some borders, yawn.  The adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his many Visa cards.  I rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time Mr. Rogers was having his "adventure." I am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels.  I don't know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience.  However, this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance, which is truly the theme of the book.  He already knows it all and will tell you all about it.  Which makes one wonder:  why did he bother to leave NY City in the first place?  I guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young (naive and pliable? -- certainly lubricious) daughter of one of his clients.  And a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those "brown faces" he's driving through.  The arrogance, the arrogance!  Typical privileged, right-wing know-it-all.  I'd like to see him try to survive in the Peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment.  This is not a travel book: Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant. You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter, "Afterword." I will summarize his position: governments are bad; smart, rich guys like me are good (remember October 1929?). Many of his predictions are laughably wrong. He advocated selling the US economy short in 1993.  Look at the US stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ...  Gosh!  Idiot!  Some reviews are touting his prescience on markets.  Hello?  How about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world?  Mr. Rogers' writing is very poor and it's loaded with cliche's. He and Tabitha are always zooming on "powerful steeds" into "gorgeous scenery", or "steep, craggy mountains" into "glitzy, glamorous hotspots" or "delightful, cozy hostels", or across "hot, empty, flat deserts" into "dumps" that are not up to American standards. He'll "describe" one of the greatest mountain chains on earth, the Andes, as "the top of the world" (p. 315) for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing.  Great writing?  Rubbish!  I think he used a computer program to come up with his "descriptions" of the places he went.  Mr. Rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he doesn't learn anything along the way. He views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics. Most of the "interesting facts" he mentions about theses places are just wrong. One indicative example: He describes the Moreno Glacier in Argentina as, "one of the few in the world still moving." (p. 294) I found myself laughing out loud many times at his "facts" and descriptions.  If you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world, read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," by Jared Diamond. If you want to read about a real motorcycle trip, read Ted Simon's "Jupiter's Travels," or Robert Fulton's, "One-Man Caravan."  For good travel books, try:  "Seven Years in Tibet" (Harrer), "News from Tartary" (Fleming), "Arabian Sands" (Thesiger), "Gypsy Moth Circles the World" (Chichester), "Sailing Around the World" (Slocum), "Motoring With Mohammed" (Hanson), "Full Tilt" (Murphy), "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush" (Newby), or "Eastern Approaches" (MacLean) "My Life with the Eskimo" (Stefansson), "Endurance" (Lansing).  I could go on and on.  "Investment Biker" is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more.  "Investment Biker," a classic? That's ridiculous.  From another review:  "Greatest Book on Finance, Business, Travels Ever"  That comment almost leaves me speechless.  Obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential! Clever, fun lyrics, great beat, but BOY I wish this guy could hit his notes more often!  I suppose this fellow requires the sort of "pitch doesn't matter" mindset that Grateful Dead listeners perfected years ago (or similar drugs). I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 John Searle is unique among today's Anglo-American philosophers for his understandable and breezy writing style.  He tells you what he is going to tell you; tells you; and then tells you what he told you - almost as though he were briefing the Pentagon.   Construction of Social Reality is a fine example.  Searle is a philosophical realist and has always made a compelling case for our living in a single world, part of it outside of us and part within us, part objective and part subjective, part ontologic and part epistemic.  In this book, in fact, he reviews the various combinations quite neatly.  (Searle, in the early chapters, also includes animals other than humans.  Another positive!)    In trying to convince us that institutions are as real as the brute facts of existence and mind he stumbles.  He is correct on one score; institutions are real.  But Searle builds  virtually his entire argument on the conception of collective intent, or collective intention (or intentionality).  On the one hand, he dismisses a version of the collective conscious, or geist as Hegel supposes.  He makes no argument, other than the concept does not make  common sense - especially for a realist.  On the other hand, he counters the "opposite" position, that each individual expresses collective intent as "I intend because I believe you intend."   That is not the case either, he asserts.  Instead he believes that "we intend" operates linguistically and innately - as an a priori mental function.   Simply because each sentient being is distinct from each other does not necessarily mean that, through language, we cannot express "we intend."   This is pretty much the argument upon which he builds the entire book.    First, Searle does not consider other intentional patterns, such as one individual asserts "I intend" at time t, and another asserts "I [too] intend" at time t+n.  In fact, Searle, in his "we intend" (I hesitate to call it an argument, as his case is too shallow for that) conjecture, does not consider time at all, in particular atomicity - wherein events occur or are perceived "simultaneously" within some acceptable bound.   I personally prefer the "sequential, but appearing simultaneous," approach to the creation of institutional rules and facts, but this is not the place to make an argument.   There are many examples of institutions, great and small, that have been created by a single mind, and then many, more or less, instantly agreed.  Thus, the appearance of "we intend."  One can think of thousands of examples: Freud and psychoanalysis, George Halas and the National Football League, Marx and Communism, to name three.        It is a great loss indeed that Searle undermines his own case, as he is correct in asserting that institutions are real.   In fact, his description of how names, functions, and rules are identified is clear, and his examples of money, baseball, football, and marriage are apt and entertaining.     There are other profound difficulties.  In describing his theory of the "logical construction" of social reality, Searle uses what he refers to as "iteration," with a feeble presentation of symbolic logic.  In fact, what he is describing is the well-worn and well-understood theory of logical types, proposed by Russell and used in the social sciences, notably by Gregory Bateson, to explain the ever-rising tree of abstraction.   Either Searle is unaware of this work, or he must believe that it is inappropriate or simply wrong.  In any case, he never mentions it.   (He also fails to cite references to "the evening star" expression, which resonates as far back as Parmenides and as recently as Karl Pooper - and many other logicians.  He cannot be unaware of this tradition, yet he writes: "there is an expression" [the evening star] ... it has a sense and meaning" as though he were breaking new ground in linguistics and the philosophy of language.)          Another troubling point is this:  Searle believes (again he has no sustainable argument) that processes precede the objects they [eventually] correlate with.   He devotes an entire heading (in Chapter 2) to it: "Systematic Relations and the Primacy of the Act over the Object."   His answer to why there is this primacy is simply "that the `objects' are really designed to serve agentive functions and have little interest for us otherwise... they are just placeholders of activities [his italics]."    This suggestion discards thousands of years of mathematics and its role in philosophy.   If we are to presume that human thinking is most exquisitely captured by our mathematics (thus space vessels we launch into outer space contain mathematical symbols in the hopes that other sentient species might understand us), then we cannot avoid what has been proven: that objects are bound by the operations under which they are closed.   In fact, there are no placeholders.  Processes (to use Searle's word) and objects are intrinsic to one another.  Each inheres within the other.     Despite the leap from static mathematical relations to real world activities and objects, I find this to be a far more convincing explanation.  This, not just because of its pedigree, but because it also raises the issue of bounded time - as I discussed above under collective intent: What is - in fact - atomic and what is not?   Here again Searle does not raise the temporal issue at all. For example, how long are his "placeholder objects" placeholders?  A millisecond?  A thousand years?  Just long enough?   Searle is at his most creative in Chapter 6: "Background Abilities and the Explanation of Social Phenomena."   Here he will not truck with previous work, specifically by "Chomsky or Fodor and not even Freud" on consciousness and the unconscious.  Instead, he proposes "an alternate form of presentation."  Hoping to close in on neurophysiology, he suggests how intentionality is born, speculating upon "states," "functions," and so on, revisiting [uncredited but for his own] work on the will, motivation, learning, and the boundaries between the individual alert mind and the phylogenetic, historical mind.  It is at this point that I more clearly understood Searle's objective.  Put broadly, How can we infer the reality of social institutions and their behavior from the metaphors of mind?  The question, the objective, suddenly struck me as unimportant.   Do Searle's meta-states and pre-intentional background and dispositions and tendencies represent a closed mapping of mental abstraction to brain function and organization?   Is it an accurate mapping?  Can it be verified?   The answer to all is very probably No.  But even if the answer were Yes, the answer is meaningless.  The question is equivalent to looking for the lost wedding ring only under the street lamp of consciousness, which is of course Searle's field.    Given that the ontology of our institutions and societies have evolved into highly artificial, complex hives of isolation, a fruitful line of questioning would seem to run more towards moral inquiry than brain chemistry.    Yes, we live in a world of natural and artificial phenomena.  All are real.  But, it seems to me, the decisive issue is why mankind, which has evolved to attain a far greater degree of free will than any other being on the planet, persists in creating such a plethora of artificiality, to the point that we are undermining the very world we live in?  Why do human beings - perhaps because we know we are living under a death sentence? - try to find solace, not just in groups, but in the fervent pursuit of machines, numbers, religions, money, and acquisitions?    . A final comment or two on the book.  Chapters 7 through 9 are an add-n, as Searle mentions in the Introduction.  As a kind of coda, he replays his view of realism and correspondence theory.   While this message could stand to be reread, it did not need to be rewritten; and it upsets the balance of the book.   Also, given the number of terms Searle introduces in the book, the index is meager and not particularly helpful.       
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 I'm always looking for ways to make coding work better, at any level from nanosecond arithmetic operations to decade-long enterprise operations. I didn't find much of use here, but there were a few good points here (very few). Let me start with those.  The "Execute Around Method" pattern is good idea, applicable far beyond this Smalltalk context. The Beta language has "inner" inheritance, which makes the idea easy, but most other languages lack a good mechanism for undefined logic between matched operation pairs (open/close, setup/cleanup, etc.) "Enumeration" is another good one, enshrined as "Visitor" in the Gang of Four book.  Most of what's left is either trivial or Smalltalk-specific and face it, Smalltalk is mostly a cult language with nearly no commercial significance. The Smalltalk pretty-printing and variable-naming rules, fatuous at best, are just not applicable to most langages. Some of Beck's "practices" are language features (like 'super'). Other "practices", like the long chapter on Collections, seem to describe standard library classes and messages. Yet others (e.g. Type Suggesting Parameter Name) correct language defects - Smalltalk chose to give up the error detection capability offered by variable typing. Beck tries to sneak it back in with variable naming conventions sort of like Microsoft's old Hungarian naming. Some of his suggestions are just dangerous, like that one that says a constructor should "half-way construct an object in one place, then pass it off to another to finish construction. (p.23)" This distributes an object's setup responsibility across its client classes, leaves unusable and incomplete objects floating around, and causes subtle exposures in multithreaded systems - I'd rip out any code I saw built this way.   The good news is that no new trees died to make my copy of this book - I got it used, and it's returning to the used market. At least my conscience is clean on that account, no matter what I'm doing to the poor guy who buys this book next.  //wiredweir 
 Being from Paris and now living in the US, I looked forward to this book.  I thought I would get a review of history and maybe find out new things.  The history is OK but very slim in many instances.  What disappointed me the most was that there were almost no pictures.  It would have been fun, for example, to have both historical illustrations and modern pictures of an area being described in this book.  Many things are described but it just is not the same as seeing it in pictures.  Most illustrations were obscure and not explained within the context of the book.  All in all, better to get two books - one on history and the other on architecture.  Trying to do justice to both does not work 
 I listened to "Piece of Mind" religiously for almost two years.  It never left my disc changer.  "Concious" has two or three notable songs.  But it does not have the consistency of "Piece of Mind."  She seems to be aiming for commercial success.  She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler.  
 I can not comprehend Mr. Watson's intentions in writing this book.  Although I disagree with the parents of the Columbine victims who believe that more gun laws will prevent further school violence, I respect their opinion and would not dare insult them in a way that this author insults those parents with Christian beliefs.    Not once does this author offer solid evidence that the Rachel and Cassie accounts never happened.  He even goes so far as to quote law that a jury must follow in defining "proof" because it is so lacking in this book that the author can only be too aware of it.  He insults the victims and their families by calling into question their stories, essentially calling them liars, based only on his own speculation.  With the mass of confusion in the library that day, the Cassie story will always be debated, yet again, Mr. Watson offers no new evidence.  As for Rachel Scott's story: the following text is an excerpt from page 151 of  No Easy Answers, The Truth Behind Death At Columbine  by Brooks Brown and Rob Merritt.  "After he got the breathing tube out, he (Castaldo) was crying and upset, telling me through sobs how they taunted her (Rachel Scott) and teased her about God," Castaldo's mother Connie Michalek, told the Denver Rocky Mountain News on April 21, 2000.  Mr. Watson  actually explores the idea that she was being less than truthful with what Richard said in the hospital that day!     It is the opinion of this reader that if an author wishes to make the accusations that he does, he should bring new and compelling evidence to the table.   This book offers no new insight into the Columbine tragedy. The information he cites as evidence has been around for years, and is available to anyone with internet access or a library card.  
 While Dirk Vandewalle draws extensively from North's scholarly masterpiece on institutional development, his own work fails to break new ground on a provocative subject.  Very disappointing 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 I was hoping to read an informative, yet entertaining study on the history and impact of Hillary Clinton, whom I'm no fan of.  But the author constantly digresses into a pendantic rage. And ruminations follow one after another on Hillary's powers and why they should be stopped.  Yet she fails to make a case for why one should support or not support her views on Clinton.  The final 200+ pages take the reader through a thoroughly boring, month by month overview of Hillary's duties as First Lady.  By the final chapters I could barely keep awake 
 Oh, it's authentic all right - an authentic pick-up band (hopefully) sight-reading isolated parts from marching band arrangements.  Poor voicings, arrangements and technically sloppy - at best!  I believe this is the worst recording I have ever heard of a more-or-less professional recording group.  Buy it if you must, in quantity even, and make a beeline for the nearest skeet range so this recording will not have been made in vain.  I do believe I smell horses . .  
 Time Enough For Love is one Heinlein's most famous books and is representative of his writing style, pacing and world view.  He touches upon many sociological subjects and tackles a number of interesting subjects and taboo mostly related to sex, incest the meaning of love.  That being said, after having his "big three" (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Moon is A Harsh Mistress and TEFL) I personally don't enjoy his work, I can understand why I'm in the minority.  TEFL follows the eternal Lazarus Long through his numerous adventures as he recounts his life while looking for reason to continue living.  The novel is divided up into four main sections uneven in length in quality.  There are times when Heinlein is right on target, examining social constructs, where they came from and how we deal with them.  Then there are times when there isn't much going on.  I think my two biggest problems with the novel were its structure and main character.  The makeup of the novel didn't lead to enough events happening nor did it produce any type of conflict normally needed to produce tension.  The novel is extensively dialogue driven and Shakespeare this is not.  Asimov got it right by mixing dialogue driven characters with at least some action but there is really very little going on in TEFL.  The one story that has some semblance of dramatic events (The Adopted Child) is clearly everyone's favorite.  As the main character Lazarus Long is lacking.  I kept drawing parallels between him and another famous fictional character: Lestat de Lioncourt from Rice's Vampire novels.  Both obviously share the immortal parallel but Lestat's personality and flaws made him much more interesting as a character.  Perhaps Long is a characterization of Heinlein himself and as we all know fiction is better then reality.  This book was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula in 1974.  A particularly amazing year with Clark's Rendezvous With Rama and Niven's Protector also in the mix.  Rendezvous is in a whole different playing field then the rest and won both awards hands down and deservedly so.  Bottom Line:  Maybe a must read for Heinlein aficionados and readers of classic sci-fi but this just doesn't work as social sci-fi for me.  Also the book is just too long 
 Why are they stealing all of SC8/SC7's songs? And why do they still have a label? I doubt this album moved 10 copies. And also, did anyone notice that 1/2 the group left? I'm sorry...but this is pathetic 
 Every one of them has been trouble, and all the trouble is in the base. The cheap metal contacts droop in a week and then do not make good contact with the batteries (fix: open base, extend contacts) and the base O-ring always fails and in no time the contacts corrode. Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best. 
 Yeah, that is extreme, but my goodness.  Based on the original spy kids, the kid in me was excited about another movie with 3D glasses~~ Whooooo!  Well, let me tell you, I have seen some bad movies, but this was worse than anything I have ever seen.  There was just nothing there.  I won't go into the "plot" because others have already done it.  I think that if you are 11 years old and excited about watching a 3D film you may like this, but anyone older will be wondering "what is this crap that I am watching?"  In order to give it a fair review, I watched the whole thing and it was just terrible.  Sylvester Stallone must really be hard up for roles because I can't believe that he starred in such crap.    Bottom line, I think the creators placed too much of their focus on making a 3D movie.  Clearly, the plot and lines were an afterthought.  Clearly.  I have to give this movie an F-.  I will never watch it again and if I felt it would sell for more than a few pennies on Ebay, I would get rid of it.  I'll be putting this DVD in my DVD graveyard 
 I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience.  
 Kozol spews his normal emotional stuff but fails to get to the underlying problem: government-provided goods always have at least 2 out of 3 features: they cost a lot, they are low in quality, and they harm the poor. Government education wins the Trifecta: it does all three.  If someone said that lower income people who get food stamps should have to spend their food stamps in government run supermarkets, we would see the idiocy: government has no edge in producing or distributing food. Well, now we have government giving education stamps but saying they have to be spent in government run education stores. Kozol has no right to be shocked. 
 Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem.   Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair 
 I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.   It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.  Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.  Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book 
 This merciless attack is filled with unsubstantiated pronouncements (not to mention typos) about Chaplin including a diagnosis of manic-depressive personality disorder offered nearly twenty years after his death and with no research nor expertise to support it. And is Joyce Milton herself qualified to make this judgment? Of course not. While this discourse is passed off as well-researched, one look at the notes and citations shows a limited selection of sources with a clear intention--to topple Chaplin whom Milton simply does not like. It seems as if the thesis of this book was in place well before the "research" began. Such is the tone of personal invective Milton fobs off as insight. I would never claim that Charlie Chaplin was a saint; no one can reasonably make that assertion about anyone. Unfortunately, Joyce Milton shows how imperfect a writer can be. Sadly for her, she picks up where Kitty Kelly leaves off. Shameful 
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 I was in a hurry when I chose this book, now I wish I'd spent a little more time flipping through it. Each section begins with dialogue between Matty and the people/dogs he is working with. That part is completely pointless, and not even entertaining to me. Finally I realized I could skip half of each chapter to get to the meat. Still though, there is pointless ad-libbing through the actually instructions! By skipping, it only took me 45 minutes to get through this book. If you can manage that, there is some usefull advice. However, for such a thick book, I was very surprised that it only covered basic commands. I am still a little confused about how to train my dog! Definately not worthy of "The Ultimate Guide.." title 
 Although I applaud the author for researching the shroud, simple math eliminates his hypothesis for Da Vinci as the author because the shroud can be 100% proven to date back to 1357-Da Vinci wasn't born until 1452. 
    Dont get me wrong this book does teach you the basics and then abit more but, if you're like me and learn more visually then reading, then this book aint for you. This books artwork is real 80s work, ya know pointy face with messed up face features like eyes alittle to high or not portioned correctly, all old etc etc( even Dragon ball Z style looks better then these ). So that for one through me off I have little anime/manga experience and my artwork is far better then this one so I suggest buying How to draw manga volume one and not MORE how to do draw manga volume one ( which is just as good or better in the reading portion )For the older volume has a more Recent style and not an old style. Although this volume gives you info that should be needed in this catagory it just makes you feel like your drawings will end up turning out old and ugly, not something for ppl who are looking for a more recent drawing style. And Btw MHTDM Volume 2 has a more recent style so if you are planning on buying two, go for it 
 After reading the synopsis and reviews, I was excited about reading this book. The book itself, however, was a letdown.   On the plus side, the author seems genuine and enthusiastic. On the negative side, the book doesn't really have much content of value in it.   The pictures and drawings are cute, but not useful. The philosophy espoused is simplistic. The writing style is average at best.  I was hoping for Thoreau crossed with the Whole Earth Catalog. This is far from that 
 I was very pleased with the book,"Wurthering Heights" and the service in sending it to me.   THank you. 
 As an enthusiastic student of chado and the Japanese arts in general, I bought this book thinking I would learn something new about wabi and/or sabi. Simultaneously I also purchased the Koren book Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers. In an oddly disturbing way, both books have uncanny similarities in their conceptual and pictorial approaches--except that the Koren book is vastly more insightful, more beautiful, and was written nine years earlier! What's going on 
 i purchased this book for my cousin who is 7 years old.  She looked at it and thought it was cool.  When she opened it she found the instruction booklet missing.  Also when she painted her fingernails, the nail polish was peel- off, and came off within a few hours.  This product is un-satisfatory, and i suggest you don't purchase it 
 The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!!  You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell?  Exxon?  Enron?!?  There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one.  I wonder what their incentive might be?? 
 they have no talent and are extremely bland to listen t 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I found this book disappointing.  It was very basic and anecdotal, and seemed to only brush the surface of many of the issues I am seriously struggling with.  Some may find it useful, but being fairly educated and  knowledgeable as a parent, I found it rather insulting 
 I became a fan of this series back in the 1970's, beginning with its first edition.  At that time, it had 3 authors, and the net effect of their input was very balanced, extremely interesting commentary.  As time passed, I stopped buying the book, but when I became a librarian I recommended that my library purchase it every two years.  Now I am the one who makes the purchasing decisions, and after buying, or recommending the purchase of, every edition since 1994, I have regretfully decided not to buy this one.  What remains good about this series is the facts, the statistics, the ratings of members of Congress--anything that does not involve real judgment.  But those are available elsewhere.  It was only with the 2004 edition that I really noticed how much this series has changed.  The narratives, which constitute the bulk of the book and used to be the highlight of it, are now completely dominated by Michael Barone's conservative point of view.  There is no leavening process left here.  A co-author is listed, but it must be someone who agrees with Mr. Barone down the line.  And that is a pity, because this was a really fine series for many years, as much for the narrative as anything.  I am going to be looking for another source for the facts and figures in the future, because this is now, as someone wrote below, the Red State Almanac.  I suppose someone else might come up with a Blue State Almanac.  But that is not what we need--more polarization, more one-sidedness disguised as balance.  We need for Michael Barone to find someone who will counterbalance his point of view with a different one and then sit down and iron out a narrative that combines them.  It was done in the 70's, and it can be done now.    Were I to continue to buy this book, I would have to buy another one to balance it out.  What a pity to see this decline in such interesting political times 
 I bought my Kodak V570 less than a year ago. At first the only annoyance I had was the fact that I had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in MOV format that made it diffcult to edit. But a few months ago, the focus refused to work properly. In wide angle, it was fine but when I zoomed in, the image was unacceptably blur. I tried every setting, finally gave up and called Kodak service. I was asked to mail the camera to Sydney from Melbourne where I live. A few weeks later, the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. Since I still could not take acceptable pictures, I contacted them again. This time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. I did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. But the pictures were taken in broad daylight. When I disagreed with the logic of the comment, I was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. But the number they gave me was a fax number. Using my resources, I got in touch with technical service by phone. This time I was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright, it's probably due to shaky hands! It's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. It is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent India trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. Now I have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. There is no way I will ever buy another Kodak again. I can recommend it only to my worst enemies. I have now to, again, send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far, I am not holding my breath for answers. Still want to buy a Kodak? Go ahead but don't say I did not warn you. By the way, my other camera is a Casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not 
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 It is unfortunate that there is no good history of the Hmong published in any Western language.  Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing.  He is not a professional historian.  The first chapter  in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows  his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese  sources.  (The story of the "Hmong" king's defeat by China  actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.)   Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des  Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924).  For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert  Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii  Press, 1994).  The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read  with caution and cross-checked with other sources 
 Some deluded person with bad hearing compared James Blunt to Tori Amos. Hardly. He was lucky with 'Beautiful'. Listen closely- that sucks too! The ramblings of an emotionally desperate middle school student. I rue the day she made eye contact with James. This album is like hummingbird nectar- lotsa sugar but no substance. I hate that I was tricked into buying it. I hate that James Blunt took 80 minutes of my life that I will never recover. I was so hopeful when I bought it. Bottom line: Melodramatic lyrics coupled with uninspired music. Skip it 
 I find the entire story to be contrived.  I know of many people who work in the area of psychology, psychiatry and mental health. Personally I have a degree in Psychology and currently work in the field. There is little evidence in the book that would be a grounds for so many years in institutions! My feeling is there is more illness than is being relayed, classic Sociopathic symptoms come to mind.I fear this kind of diatribe aimed at institutions will hurt the field of mental health and I believe it will harm the gay population as well for allowing fiction to be exemplified as actual experience of a young lesbian woman as I highly doubt she was institutionalized for being a tom- boy. There are too many true and terrible stories that need to be recognized, not this false memoir 
 I usually don't like to be a negative critic of others' writing, but i felt that i had to say something to help someone else avoid the mistake of buying this book. each poem sounds exactly like every other teenage angst poem that we all wrote at the age of 12. i think these people should grow up a little, learn a bit about what poetry can really sound like (here's a hint: not every poem you write needs to use the rhyming words such as me see be,  you too blue, love above dove), then rewrite everything thats in this book. try reading saul williams' poetry for example, and don't waste your money on this nonsense 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 In short, Goto is a very poor writer.  After a few chapters I began to wonder if the author has access to a dictionary. You would think someone who makes a living writing action / war novels would know the difference between "report" and "recoil". His battle descriptions are terrible.  As for his dialogue, well, just be glad there isn't much.  It is unlikely that I will give him another shot.  I hope they keep him out of the Horus Heresy series.  1 star, save your money 
 This item is horrible. It falls apart constantly. We tried hot gluing and superglue, however, NOTHING works. Even our 4-1/2 YR son has told us to throw this out he is so frustrated.  Part of appeal was you can take Imaginext items &  reconfigure them, great concept. However, no matter how you configure them, they ALL fall apart.   During assembly notice they do not "click" as you would expect. Pieces never lock together, even with the bottom "base" pieces.  We resorted to putting all the Imaginext on a table for him to play, however, flat surface, bumpy surface, any surface, it falls apart.  PLEASE do not waste your money as we have. Unfortunately we spent approximately $150 on various Imaginext last Christmas. Do not make the same mistake we did. When a 4-1/2 YR wants you to throw out his toys, somethings wrong 
 Not worth the money. Little explanation of anything especially how he achieved the results he describes. Even the first page is a chart with no explanation. Don't buy if your interested in learning about the Forex. I should have known better with a title like that! 
 I never liked this story.  First of all, I didn't like the island of unwanted toys.  I also didn't like the way the movie ended because I didn't like the way the scene of Santa's noisy sleigh flying to that island made me feel.  And what was wrong with the doll on the island?  We had Charlie-not-Jack-in-the-box, an ostrich riding cowpoke, a jelly squirting gun and a doll with no visible challenges.  In addition to being maudlin, I didn't like the way Rudolf was accepted only after he bailed out the other reindeer.  Sure, the other reindeer loved Rudolf and shouted out with glee - they could afford to after he bailed them out.  Like couldn't he be accepted before he pulled that sleigh that foggy Christmas?  I'd recommend all the other Christmas stories before this one 
         If this book was written by a caucasian it would be considered racist and separatist.   I have an African American grandson and I hope he never reads books that encourage one race to view another with disgust.   In the book the author refers to blacks who are going to see a movie for the sole reason it has a black director.   I don't understand this line of thinking.  If you had a book that referred to having an all white movie weekend-only white actresses, only white directors, I think the author would be called to task.    To say for example that Richard Gere is a perfect actor because he would never kiss a black woman.  Yet it is ok if it is Denzel Washoington never kissing a white woman.  A true example of a double standard here.   I think this author can not get beyond her own racism to write the story.  The story might have been good-Pamela Mutch Steven 
 We don't have our baby yet  -but have tried the tub to see if it works.  The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it.  this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't.  The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor.  Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Our wireless internet causes this to sputter greatly if you use a laptop anywhere in the vicinity.  Also, our Nintendo Wii has a built in wifi card. That means anytime the Wii is on, the TV in the greatroom using the LeapFrog can't be watched.  Our microwave disrupts the signal.  As an added bonus, cordless phones disrupt the signal.  Basically... it's a good product if you can isolate it from other signals.  It offers channel options, but they do not solve the problem.    Buy with caution 
 I was excited to find a book filled with fun, fresh summer ideas but one look inside and I was so disappointed. The premise of the book is fresh, easy meals that appeal in those lazy summer days and nights yet the book is filled with not terribly interesting, not terribly difficult but very fussy meals. Who needs that in the summer? and who needs this book -- certainly not me 
 The Evolutionists is an endlessly repetitive, poorly organized book, replete with spelling and grammatical errors.  Worse, it is an uninspired introduction to a fascinating and important topic.  Morris appears to have expended as little effort as possible researching this book, and evinces only a facile understanding of the issues he engages.  The Evolutionsists reads like a third-rate middle school book report.  It's about 5 pages of content morphed into 200+ pages of text (how many times can Morris report exactly the same findings about stickleback fish?  I lost count...).  Though not popular science writing at its worst (Morris at least comes across as a neutral reporter, and his facts are generally correct), the Evolutionists is popular science writing at its most mediocre.  What a disappointment.  Are Morris' other books this lame?           
 this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles II, but otherwise its just a mess. the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble, but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes, who also gave us such film masterpieces as "casino royale" and "chitty chitty bang bang". richard harris is his usually unrestrained self, and thats not a compliment. now, i wont even go into the politics, which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero: as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas's paean to charles II in "twenty years after", but nowhere near as entertaining. 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 This is a quick and easy book to read since the author only presents the very few facts that support his opinions. If you waste your money on this book, at least you won't waste much time 
 I bought this television from Amazon.  Twice.  Both times Amazon sent the wrong t.v.  The reason is because this television does not exist.  If you don't believe me, look on samsung's website.  The LNS1951D and LNS1952D are not produced.  The "D" at the end of the product ID stands for "Integrated ATSC Tuner."  If you buy this t.v., you will not receive the "D" version.  You will receive the "W" version.  The "W" stands for "without Integrated ATSC Tuner."  The ATSC Tuner is not included on Samsung Televisions until they are 26" or larger.  I had to send both televisions back and eventually settled for a Sharp with ATSC Tuner.  Clearly Amazon refuses to acknowledge this problem and continues to falsely advertise this item.  Oh, and Amazon wasn't exactly apologetic either.  After wasting a month of my time and hours on the telephone with customer service, they merely offered to refund my money.  Thanks Amazon 
 So, reading the other reviews I felt compelled to add my thoughts.  Someone said earlier, glad to see someone from bean town getting props.  What the heck dude?  Mr. Lif.  There are so many awesome artists from this area, don't spend your money on a band whose career has been made through disses.  I don't like Eminem, but Benzino and the Made Men, have 'Made' themselves by jacking others fame.  I like the guest work, but the guests are better than the group itself.  Get there stuff.  Guests can be useful but they usually show that a band is lacking talent when overused.  I listened to this album and wished I could get my money back.  It's not even worth selling, I wouldn't want to screw anyone else 
 Doesn't do it for me.  Go to sleep Armin...  You'll never be a Paul Oakenfold, DJ Tiesto, or Carl Cox 
 I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet.  We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar.  It is not!  It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place.  She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing!  I would not purchase this product 
 There was very little useful information in the book about the details of obtaining patents or trademarks - a lot of legal definitions and the like but few nuts and bolts for anyone looking to apply for them 
 It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this.  This film was not at all faithful to the book.  The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg.  In the movie, the spot is way over on his back!  In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long.  In the movie, it's like a foot!  The classic "this little piggy goes to market" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie!  Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for 
 R. Rose has a personal axe to grind and it distorts this entire book.  His attempt to be a "historian" is undermined by any serious attempt to look at the evidence and to use objective facts to guide his interpretation.   No serious historian would ever endorse this book and it is fatally flawed by Rose's bias.  
 Watch the movie first for the breathtaking special effects.  Only then if you're interested, should you buy the book, because it has a few more details in it.  I pity those who bought the hardcover 
 Quite disconnected from my point of view.  Hard to know what the heck is going on withour reading the VCR jacket and I'm not sure it was right!  Slapstick quality but just too disconnected.  No real story 
 I love Lee.  I mean his stuff is just so much fun.  When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked.  Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read.  I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road.  Then I read the Messenger.  This is the worst I have read from Lee.  It contained none of the fun of his other novels.  Stay away from this one.  
 In "Government Gay" (1997), the first book in Fred Hunter's Alex Reynolds mystery series, Alex's lover Peter is kidnapped.  In Chapter 15 of that novel, Alex finally rescues Peter from a locked hotel room by using his VISA card to pop the lock on a door off which the numbers had fallen, leaving only the shadows of said numbers on the grimy door.  Alex explains to his readers that he had learned this simple break-in technique from a neighbor.  In Chapter 12 of "National Nancys" (2000), the fourth book in the series, Alex is again trying to break into a hotel room, this time using bobby pins, when Peter suggests, "Why don't you try a credit card?"  Alex looks up at him, and says, "What?"  And Peter then proceeds to explain to Alex how the technique works.  Alex whips out his VISA card, but is unable to make the "new" trick work, leaving Peter to demonstrate how to pop the lock successfully.  Uh ... hello!  Wake up, Mr. Author!  Oh!  And did I mention that in this novel - too - the room number is able to be identified only because there were shadows left on the dirty door where the numbers used to hang?  It's this kind of sloppy, repetitive, and extremely formulaic writing that makes the Alex Reynolds series so incredibly tired.  Apparently author Hunter was so disinterested in the books that he didn't bother to worry about repeating himself after only four plots!  And sure enough, there is little about "National Nancys" to distinguish it from its previous three cookie-cutter predecessors.  Insist on trying out this series?  Pick one title, any title, and borrow it from the library.  Now you know exactly what happens in each of the first four novels! Alex, Peter, and Alex's mom get involved with murder; withhold evidence from the authorities; are warned by those same authorities to stop investigating; ignore the advice; barely escape death; wrap up the case.  Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z .. 
 I ordered this book, and thought I would not have to read the text, but I was unprepared for the class.  I also did not need the busy-work portions of the book 
 The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made 
 not very "thought-provoking" as the book claims, just get Gregory Stock's Book of Question's instead if you ARE looking for a true "conversation piece". 
 I bought this to help with college after being out for 10yrs-almost impossible to install plus it does not allow you to make any adjustments if your professor wants it a certain way. Useless-buy the cheat sheet at barnes and noble 
 My husband and I were looking for a book to read on things we should do to prepare to get pregnant and some helpful tips on good times when to attempt to having a baby but to be frank 95 percent of the book is for people that are having problems having a baby so if you looking for something like I did that will just give you insight on foods you should eat, things to avoid ect this isnt the book for yo 
 Having read several CS books, this one breaks no new ground.  Had this  book come out five years ago, it would have been more useful.  As is, the  book seems terribly dated and not especially enlightening.  If you've read  nothing about customer sat, then this book is a good read 
 This book is weak.  This is trivia and really nothing more.  I have caught Perry's articles on the national website he works for and I am unimpressed with both this book and his columns.  Extreme bias and inability to look at baseball as a game and a sport leave Perry  with a backwards "K".  Pick up anything from Bill James, Peter Angell or the Baseball Prospectus and you will do much better than this "writing."    
 I used this book for a graduate-level engineering course. This book is one of the worst textbooks I have seen.  Is is evident that several people wrote this textbook because the style of writing will change between sections from informal to formal. Some of the sections are better written than others. In the poorly written sections, it can be very hard to follow what they are trying to say. Overall, the writing is very disjointed and care should have been taken to properly introduce topics and create more of a flow to the text.  Also, there are numerous spelling errors and incomplete sentences in the text. For a third edition, one would expect those errors to be corrected; they are very obvious.  The examples also contain errors. Again, the errors are very obvious such as 11-2=7. I would not recommend this textbook. At first glance, it appears to be a very comprehensive book but, actually it is very poorly written and does not explain the material well 
 I'm all for simplicity and living with less so that's why I picked up a copy of this book at the library.  I was really, really disappointed to find that this was a book about living simply but with God.  If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church.  If you're looking for a book about simplicity or looking to scale back I recommend Frugal Living for Dummies, The Everything Budgeting Book, Living the Simple Life or The Joy of Simple Living 
 I have to agree with the last reviewer, that this book is a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps that is due more to my expectations of the book than the actual content. What I was looking for was concrete techniques to assist in raising children bilingually, with information backed up by research from the field. There is a large amount of research on the topic of bilingualism, and it would be nice to find it summarized in a single volume. However, this is a series of excerpts taken from various parents in bilingual situations together with reasonably obvious statements, with little relation to linguistic research. While the various opinions from parents were interesting, this could be found online at a bilingual forum. The rest, you will probably already know by instinct 
 There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic.  There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905).  The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format.  If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release.  A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all.  Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen.  None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable 
 'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off! It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'

 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 Up front, let us grant that Haught gets a few things straight.  He acknowledges the impact Darwin has had on our view of life.  And the supernatural.  Many of Darwin's successors declared natural selection signalled the end of theism.  That terminal judgment will be addressed in this book, but he warns that theology must still "come to grips" with the "opulence of evolution".   From this opening he seeks to create a new theology.  In order to launch this enterprise, Haught must sweep away some obstructions.  Among these obstacles is the wave of "intelligent design" [which is neither] - Michael Behe's excuse for failing to understand how natural selecton works.  Haught dismisses Behe with ease, claiming the idea "ignores novelty".  So far, so good.  Haught then mounts his pulpit to steal a book title as a means of launching an assault on Darwin's most penetrating students, Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins.  "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" [1995] is what this book is about.  Haught flaunts the term often.  Each time, he tries to discount it, sniping at Dennett for being "prolific" and his presentation as done "in laborious detail".  The detail appears to have been too much for Haught, since he seems to have missed many of the more obvious points.  Dawkins, a much more outspoken non-theist than Dennett, if that's possible, gives Haught the vapours.  Dawkins' "selfish gene", a frequent target of theists, here undergoes the usual vilification.  It's "materialist" and "mechanistic".  When you're building a case for the supernatural, such ideas are anathema.  Perhaps even worse for Haught than the "Three-D" figures is that of Edward O. Wilson.  At least Dennett and Dawkins aren't lapsed Christians, but Wilson shed his Baptist upbringing when he discovered gods and life aren't related.  What greater betrayal could a theologian encounter?  While Haught is disparaging the non-theists, he steps back a bit.  He wants to show he's a reasonable man.  We're all good fellas, here.  He demonstrates his knowledge [such as it is] of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, but he wants to add a new element.  A deity.  Somewhere in the process some god has to be involved, he says.  Well, his god at any rate.  That step back puts him on a slippery slope.  As Haught builds his thesis, you observe him sliding down the ramp.  The ramp is labelled "sophistry" and Haught has a supreme talent for it.  He wants to create a "theology of evolution" - perhaps one of the more bizarre concepts of modern times.  Haught takes us through "laborious detail" in explaining how many philosophers and theologians have struggled to merge Darwin and a deity.  All have failed and Haught is no exception.  Haught's sophistry utilises a range of voices.  He even snares Taoism for a prop.  He finally selects two buttresses - Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin and philosopher Hans Jonas.  De Chardin's struggle to reconcile natural selection with metaphysics has been refuted too many times to recount here.  Jonas may be new to some of Haught's readers, but Haught attempts to introduce him.  A follower of Alfred North Whitehead, Jonas was also influenced by Jewish Kabbalistic thought.  He contends the deity [please note "the"] made the universe with the "promise" of life - and, one presumes, at some point would produce an intellect to observe it.  Jonas pushes this deity about as far from human ken as can be achieved and still have any meaning.  As a stretch of conceivability and expression of unreality, there are few peers.  What purpose such a deity could have remains escapes understanding - and reason.  It turns out this is the whole point - at some future time one of natural selection's products, humanity, will reach an "Omega Point" to encounter this deity.  To what end isn't explained.  Books such as Haught's are attempts to reconcile the irrational with the real.  Limited, as he is, by his Roman Catholic Christianity, he starts with a flimsy a priori stance.  He then tries to shore it up with a confusion of quotations synopsised ideas.  As we wade through his quote snippets, we learn that an event never historically justified, a crucifixion, provides one gleam of illumination for his thesis.  A dim light to steer by.

 Grabhorn starts with the assumption that our feelings can change the course of events around us. While there is some truth to this assumption, Grabhorn claims that our feelings could even change seemingly "random" events (like getting rear-ended on the highway). One logical question is that if two people "ask the universe" (to use Grabhorn's terminology) for opposing events, who would succeed? The question belies the assumption that there exists a plurality of distinct and individual freewill. This assumption is conveniently discarded throughout the book. Claims that whatever one asks for will come to pass litter the entire narrative.  Grabhorn states that we need to "vibrate" at the high frequencies (i.e., those that make us "feel good") attracting the same kind of frequencies to us. Her analogy is that we are magnets attracting the same kind of frequency back to our lives. The Law of the Universe that she proclaims is: "Like attracts like."  One issue with Grabhorn's analogy is that we tend to appreciate a blend of different frequencies. Musical instruments all resonate at different frequencies. It is the combination of different frequencies that appeals to us. Music (spiritual or otherwise) incorporates a variety of frequencies and tempos to arouse our souls. Another is whenever in nature there are forces of attraction and repulsion, it is opposites that attract. In magnetism, we learn that opposite poles attract. It is sometimes posited that we are naturally attracted not only to the opposite sex but also to those with accents that are different from our own.  Fundamentally, the assumptions Grabhorn makes are more outlandish than what most readers are comfortable making. The process of "feeling good" does have medically and psychologically proven benefits, but is living "as if" something were true is an entirely different issue. Grabhorn's techniques of make-belief would be too Machiavellian for our post-modern outlook.  The book could have greatly benefited from the services of an editor. The text could have been more concise and the narration could have been more crisp and lucid. A good first draft, but more work is needed.  Armchair Interviews says: Hampton Roads publishes books for the evolvinghHuman spirit on metaphysical subjects including visionary fiction, complementary and alternative medicine, self-help, science, and spiritual. This seems to be a book you will either LOVE or HATE--depending on your point of view

 By my good fortune I happen to have had the pleasure of  working with Master Kwan, However briefly, in Boston last winter. Drawn to him by "The Wandering Taoist" I happened upon him in the Boston public garden, Teaching. After a couple of months, working together with his students and speaking with them about their experiences with him, I heard a few things that could be of use to the validity of Deng Ming-Dao's work. It turns out that when I once questioned Master Kwan's main student (of ten years) about Deng Ming-Dao's work, he said that he had met Deng Ming-Dao and was present while he was being tought. that said Master Kwan's student then stated that Ming-Dao was a  western man who had asked Master Kwan if he could write a book about him. Master Kwan agreed an told Ming-Dao a few stories and such. Afterwards Mister Ming-Dao proceeded to say that he had no further use for Master Kwan, and left.  To this day Master Kwan has never read any of the material published about him, nor has he recieved any kind of royalties from Mister Ming-Dao. That said, it must be understood that Master Kwan wouldn't trouble over such things as royalties, he leads a very humble life, but his students do find it frustrating. If you would like to see Mater Kwan for who he really is, I invite you to visit the site that I stumbled upon last winter at; www.easternheathpractices.org. I hate to slander anyone over such things but I feel very strongly about this. Thanks for your time and patience 
 I performed Scene 8 from "Betrayal" in a theater class, and read the rest of the play in order to form a character analysis of Emma.  I found the play intersting, but slightly odd.  Some of the wording made no sense, and there were times when the references seemed out of place and just in there for laughs.  The play itself was an old idea broadcast in a new way-backwards.  It left me feeling bittersweet as I saw how it ended, and then saw how sweetly it started.  I recommend the play for its difference in story telling, but I'm not so thrilled with it that I would insist you see a showing.  It really seems to come down to the tastes of the person.  This one wasn't really my taste 
 I ordered the regular size, they were to big, the smaller size? too small. neither one fit well but both did one thing well, hurt the area under my eyes. Buyer BEWARE 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 I found this book to be very average. It glosses over subjects poorly, giving me the impression that the author doesn't have a great understanding of the topics discussed. If there wasn't other great books available, or superb video sites like winstructor.com I would then recommend this. But seeing as books like Mastering Windows Server 2003 and Introducing Windows Server 2003 exist and of course winstructor, then I cannot comprehend why someone would feel they got their money's worth with a purchase of this title 
 Marlon Brando once said that his friends don't write books about him.  So what does that make Englund?  Marlon said about Carlo Fiore, a once questionable so-called friend, that he probably wrote his book about Marlon because that's all he had left.  The same seems to apply to Englund.  I mean, why describe the gory details of Marlon's last night on earth in such a disgusting manner that leaves such a bad taste in our mouths about the ultimate acting icon?  Seriously, would a real 'friend' have done such a thing?  Why not leave us with some glorious memory of Marlon as a true friend would.  I mean, without the help of Englund's book, Marlon left behind a legacy of fine art and entertainment that still amazes, inspires and motivates young actors and the world at large today.  Why taint that legacy with a discussion of backsides and dung as the last thing said about the Brando legend?  If Marlon could go his whole lifetime and remain an enigma (why we love him), and I believe he did it on purpose, what gives this so-called closest lifelong friend of his the right to expose him by sharing intimate details that he probably knows Marlon would never approve of and still call himself a friend?  He's a sell-out jerk to me, but that's just my opinion.  Would Alice Marchak (Marlon's assistant) or Jocelyn (Marlon's sister) ever write a book about Marlon?  I don't think so. And they knew him best and would probably have gotten paid major big bucks to write something, anything about Marlon. They didn't because people who truly love you don't do that.  Englund would have been more of a friend if he had just kept his big mouth shut and respected the greatest actor ever, but instead he proved just how much of a friend he may have been in life, but not at all in death.  That is the lowest of all the slimballs because Marlon probably died thinking this sell-out was his friend.  NOT!!!  Now that I think about it, while this guy is trying to make everybody think that once Marlon had made his peace with him he could go on and die now, Marlon, in all his glorious brilliance to the end, may have set this guy up, knowing his greed would lead him to go public with Marlon's backside and dung details and show what a jerk he is.  Now that sounds like a Marlon prank, being transparent and naked enough even in his darkest hour to expose the greed that lied in this so-called lifelong friend's heart.  Obviously Marlon knew Englund and that he wasn't a friend. Marlon knew Englund would prove his greed, along with his disloyalty, by making the stupid choice of painting for the world such a gory picture of Marlon's last night when Marlon was brilliant enough and deserved better from a "FRIEND".  The ultimate acting icon pulling the ultimate set-up. Way to go Marlon!  You were a genius to the end.  I see clearly, this bum for what he is.  Englund said that even on his death bed Marlon said "F death".  Well I say even on his death bed Marlon said "F You Georgie". 
 Mamet does not write reality in my opinion. You hear some of the quotes and you tend to think: "Who talks like that?"   However, it is intriguing to hear it come from this ensemble cast. With an inferior cast (like the one in Spanish Prisoner, which I still liked the first time I saw it) it would have been wasted, but the three leads (Gene Hackman, Delroy Lindo and Danny DeVito) give it a crisp take that I found to be refreshing (even if the script was contrived).   Joe Moore is an old master thief who thought he did his last job (I guess he doesn't realize the "rule" that a last job for a thief usually involves killing your boss in a double cross), but is lured into another one by Mobster Bergman. He has a crew, including long term partners Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Pinky (Ricky Jay) and wife Fran (Rebbecca Pidgeon). Their job this time around is the robbing of a shipment leaving an undisclosed airport bound for Switzerland. However, there is a problem. Bergman wants his nephew Jimmy Silk (Rockwell) involved, maybe to get his feet wet, or to watch that they are not doublecrossed. He is reckless and without patience. He is not eager to learn and thinks he is wise beyond his years, but he is not as stupid as he appears to be. This wildcard is the reason that the crew begin their double crosses.   Mamet intrigued us with his take on the con-world with his excellent House of Games. He also did a very good job with The Spanish Prisoner. But this plot seems to be tired, especially since I saw "The Score" with Robert DeNiro and Ed Norton a month earlier. They have similar plotlines and while Heist is superior in terms of Dialogue, the Score had more of a payoff and better pacing. There are also things about the movie that bother me. The first is the yet again Hollywood obsession about placing a young woman with an old guy. Yes, Hackman doesn't always look his years, but he's past 70 and Pidgeon looks more like his daughter. It's creepy to see them together. The other is that Joe Moore is a skilled thief who must have spent decades as a thief. He has nothing to show for it. I don't think so...   Sam Rockwell also does a good job. He is the straight man, he is the observer and is always overshadowed by the leads but he does hold his own. The disappointing characters are Pinky (they double cross their mobster boss and he doesn't run?) and Fran. They also bothered me in the Spanish Prisoner. Their static talk drive me up the wall and the last thing Ricky Jay looks like is a thief of any sort.   As in House of Games and Spanish Prisoner, there are twists and turns everywhere, but many of them are fairly predictable. There are no "ooohs" and "aaahs" from the audience as if they are fooled. Maybe we are just too use to seeing Mamet films that the shock of a double cross wore off a long time ago. Without this surprise factor, the Heist becomes a flat film with no real interest....Rating: C

 Using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day, our family is hard on blenders.    After more than a year of daily experience with the Waring Pro (both MBB* & PBB* models) I cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making.  Here's why:  Both glass- & stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly.  This blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit.  It fails often, and must be rebuilt or replaced.  Parts are easily purchased if you're handy and have the correct tools.  DETAILS: The assembly screws together, and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart.  But this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit, that it bends the metal washer below the blade.  The assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn.  The Waring Pro is all the blender than many people will need, but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies 
 I received this as an XMas gift and can't get through it.  The book feels forced and manufactured.  There are points that are relatable but are painfully obvious, if you are a fantasy football player you are better off reading your league message board.  Everyone can relate to the overzealous owner in their league, most overzealous owners don't try to write a book 
 Published in 2000, Videohound's DVD Guide is already outdated. Why? Because so many DVD titles -- both old and new-- are being released on a weekly basis that it is simply impossible to keep current. Anyone using this guide is bound to be disappointed in the large number of currently available DVDs not listed. Until studios complete the transition of all -- or at least most -- titles from VHS to DVD, such guides will continue to be out of date and of little use. As for the actual content of Videohound's Guide; it is adequate. The reviews, which are all subjective, will strike a chord with some readers, while striking a nerve with others. One useful aspect is the rating of extra features (outtakes, documentaries, trailers, etc.) which make DVDs so much fun. Unfortuneately, Videohound is inconsistent with its extras reviews. For example, the entry for the James Bond classic "Goldfinger" fails to mention the two commentaries and two documentaries featured on the "Special Edition" release. However, the entry for another Bond film, "Thunderball", does list all the extras. Overall, this guide is a great idea. However, it needs fine tuning. Videohound's VHS guides are very good and I suspect that in a couple years -- when the transition from VHS to DVD is complete -- that Videohound's DVD Guide will also be up to par. Until then, I'd wait this one out 
 Buying the Complete Psionic was a lot like getting hit in the face with a custard pie.  Parts of it taste really good but I would have like the pie a lot better if the pie had been on my plate instead of in my face.  For those who don't know even though Bruce is listed as one of the two primary authors on the cover his was not the last hand that touched it.  After he wrote the first draft of the manuscript the material was handed off to a development team for further playtesting and refinement.  Then it went through final editing.  Somewhere in this process the proposed page count of the book went from roughly 190 pages to 160.  I'm sure Bruce had some input at various stages but I'm also sure that much of his material was changed substantially.  One example that he has admitted to was that he submitted only one "divine" class yet the final product had two, the Ardent & the Divine Mind.  This book has several major things going against it.  1. It is very poorly edited.  In addition to sloppy sentence structure and whatnot there are clear instances of where the development staff changed some of the original stuff.  If you look at the feat tables you will see that they indicate that some feats can be used "3+ Cha mod times per day" yet when you get to the feat text it's 1/day.  2. The errata changing Expanded Psionics Handbook (XPH) powers is poorly done and is mixed in with the new powers.  For example the Energy Missile & Energy Stun powers were changed so that the DC scaled +1 per 2 power points instead of the old +1 per 1 power point.  These were powers that had received complaints for scaling too quickly so this change was not entirely unexpected.  However, right there in the same section is a new energy power with the same old 1/1 scaling.  There are other examples where changes appear to be illogical.  But worst of all the things that seemed to most need errata, like clarification on the XPH Psychic Reformation power, were not done at all.  3. The content is very thin.  Only 8 Prestige Classes ... less than half of what appears in any other complete book & less than half of these are actually useable.  Only 6 new monsters and none of them are psionic constructs so the XPH feat "Craft Psionic Construct" is still unusable.    No fluff on running psi focused games ... unlike, say the Complete Warrior which has stuff on warrior focused games.  Lots of wasted space, for instance tables listing both the new powers in this book and all the ones from the XPH where all other Complete books just list the new stuff.  4. The "flavor" of Psionics is completely changed by this book.  In the XPH psi seems to be about "the power of the mind" and a psionic character is unique in that he is not dependant on outside forces or foci for his power.  His attack powers are based on creating an energy effect or affect the mind or body directly.  The Complete Psionic changes this radically.  Now some psychic characters get their powers from the gods.  They link to the inner and outer planes to create effects.  After this book there is literally nothing to separate a psion from a wizard, cleric, or paladin.  5. Many of the new powers, classes, and feats are underpowered.  For some reason the final product has an incredible focus on things that are useable once per day.  There are literally pages and pages of stuff that, if you take the class or feat you get something that can be used once per day.  This goes so far that they even mistakenly attribute some stuff in the XPH to be once per day when it is not.  With that said the book does have some very nice gems.  The Ardent & Lurk base classes are fantastically done and can be easily inserted into any ongoing game that has Psionics.  The Ardent in particular is a class that has wonderful flavor and enables one to play a "cleric" like character with a uniquely psionic feel.  The Divine Mind is mechanically interesting, being somewhere between a Paladin, Marshal, and Psychic Warrior, but the fact that they draw their powers directly from a deity disturbs me to no end.  I have no problem with a character who draws both on the power within and divine power, but I have a serious issue when WotC had deities granting psionic powers to folks.  Many of the feats are interesting and can find ready use in an ongoing game.  In fact this was probably the best section of the book for me in spite of the problems between the text and tables that I mentioned above.  Some of the new powers are useful, though plenty more are odd or seem out of place flavor wise.  The new race introduced by the book is very interesting, though I think that I would tend to use either them or the XPH Elan and not both.  I love the Erudite class & feel that it could easily be used alongside normal Psions instead of replacing them as the book suggests.  They have a fascinating blend of flexibility and restrictions that I find appealing.  I'm also big XPH Soulknife fan, and I have to admit that the Complete Psionic really delivers for them with new feats, Prestige Classes, and useful errata like the fact that dual Mind Blades can both be charged separately with Psychic Strike.  However, like the pie in the face, even though it has some great things going for it, in the end the Complete Psionic fails to deliver in a satisfying manner.  I strongly suggest actually reading some of the book before deciding to buy it.  In all honesty I would rather have had no new Psionic book rather than what was delivered in the Complete Psionic even though I will probably end up using bits and pieces of it ... and that's a hard thing for me to say since it was the psionics in the XPH that brought me back to DnD after a long absence. 
 Butterfly Stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity's sake.  This was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience.  Similar to some of Vollman's other work - this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia as background.  Unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling. 
 Chinoy approaches the writing of this book in much the same way his employer approaches world news: mistaking the urgent for the important, drawing hugely sweeping conclusions from anecdotal evidence, and ignoring all depth and context. Do yourself a favor and avoid this cartoon of a book. There are better ones out there 
 The "flow" in the book looks to be good. But the flaw is in explaining the examples. No explanation has been given for some important (atleast for me) examples! C shell examples are rarely discussed. The book  says "It helps you to develop Bourne, C, or Korn Shell mastery  step-by-step, whether you're a beginner or a ....", which I feel is  not true 
 I wish I could have given this turkey zero stars. I tried very hard to connect with this train wreck of a book but I just couldn't. If this junk makes for good book fodder then I stand a pretty decent chance of becoming an author someday. I desperately tried to search for some kind of redeeming value in this book but I guess I just didn't get it. I'm not sure why this is a best selling "Christian" book either. It was this best seller status that led me to give it a read. Don't do what I did. Give this one a pass. She kept swearing and cursing, taking Gods name in vain, kept referring to God as a female, she stated that she prefers women pastors to men pastors, perhaps worst of all, had an abortion (almost got a second abortion) and prefers to have no father figure in her sons life. (It's pretty safe to say she doesn't like men, except for when she's getting knocked up of course...). So much for traditional American/Christian values. I don't see how this is considered a good "faith" story. It's a good thing I just checked this out from the library, I would have felt more than just a  little slighted had I bought it 
 This in one of those Movies that you can watch over and over. I became a instant fan of Pascale Bussieres. I rerented it 3 times in 1995."When Night is Falling" is a Classic Love Story regardless of Sexual Orientation. Ms Bussieres is A really fine Actress. I saw this film years ago and bought the VHS from Amazon. Hopefully it will be rereleased on DVD. I have recently viewed her performance in "Blue Butterfly".She has retained both her beauth and her talents. I wish her continued success with her career 
 Some of these reviews are great.  Some are hilarious and show just how little each gender understands about the other.  My favorite review is the one that says something like "Women have more to offer than at any other time: they're better educated, they make more money, and they're more fun to be with than ever before!"  I'd love to see the statistical research backing up that last assertion.  Anyway, about the book.  Truly, all the content could have been packed into one essay.  The rest is just filler anecdotes that contribute little understanding but for some reason make up the vast majority of these types of books.  Probably because they're really not a whole lot to say on the topic.  My own experience runs something along the lines of the book.  I'm in law school and I've noticed that an extremely high number of law school women are very, very pretty yet have lots of trouble getting men interested in them.  Looking around, it's because these women are *extremely masculine.*  They have nice faces and bodies, sure, but to be a lawyer (or other professional) one must be directed, unemotional, focused, hard working, serious, outspoken and aggressive.  These are all traits that testosterone produces!  And it's true, the women in law school are far more like female men than anything else.  I'm dating a couple women who have no college degree but who are very feminine and soft and gentle, the complete opposites of law school women.  Most of the guys I know in law school are doing the exact same thing.  Therefore I think that these women are having a hard time finding men simply because men see them as other men, not as women!  Several of the women I know in law school are dating or have married rather effeminate men: artists, a whale trainer, etc.  These are not the types of men who are the "Alpha males" of the business world.  The more Alpha a male is, the more he wants someone who is his complete opposite: soft, gentle, giving, unassuming, submissive.. a girly girl.  The women mentioned in this book aren't girly girls, they're man-girls.  Who wants that?   
 Dont get me wrong, i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones.  I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies. But both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad. Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies.  The Bad:  1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were "acting" 2. The dialog's are not how people actually talk. 3. The soldiers at "Day Of The Dead" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups  4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other. 5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, "talking" ) 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere .  The Good:  1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated.   So far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1. Resident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those "just shoot and kick" movies and I'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo.    So if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie. You will be better pleased with "Cabin Fever".  If you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe Resident Evil 1, Poltergeist, the original japanese version of The Ring and The Grouch, ScareCrows. Alien, Aliens and even Alien 3 not Alien 4 (It Sucks).  But the Best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 I bought this book after enjoying Chuck Klosterman's Fargo Rock City.  The concept of the book (taking a long road trip to locations of rock and roll deaths) is excellent and if executed correctly would have been great book.  I expected insights into the deaths and the locations that could only be found by exploring them up close and in depth, which is something most of us will not have the opportunity to do.  Instead, Chuck Klosterman has a road trip where he waxes about his many dysfunctional relationships with women in between destinations.  There are a few spots of humor and insight, but not enough to overcome the off subject exposition.  The best analogy I can come up with would be buying a cookbook, and then having the author devote the majority of the book to what kind of car he drives to the grocery store 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 Avoid this one. The bad reviews are not kidding. The plot is almost non-existent. The action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing. The writing has drawn the characters very thinly. Sadly, a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together 
 You could hardly find a greater betrayal of the Situationist movement in all of its aspects, than this book, which translates a chaotic, exciting and iconoclastic movement into a boring and platitudinous addition to the obligatory academic discourse about everything.  Throw this thing in the trash, don't even resell it, certainly don't donate it to any charities or libraries.  Go right now instead and find "The Situationist International: A User's Guide" by Simon Ford, you won't regret it.  I swear to God I am not lying and I have no institutional or other affiliation that would conflict with this judgment 
 Disappointing, His real talents shine as the one line guy in concert with opie and anthony rather than solo 
 First: The original Magic Flute is in German. This version is NOT !!  Second: The audio is not Dolby Digital, not even Prologic... Bad quality Third: Bad image quality....  I do NOT reccomend this version of Magic Flute.  I do not frequently review items I have bought, but I decided to review this one because everytime my kids ask me to watch this DVD, I remember what bad choice I've made... 
 When I 1st watched Requiem From The Darkness I had high hopes for an anime show I heard that could actually by scary. To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free) 
 This is one of the worst movies ever! It seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body 
 ...but this album should never have been released as the "final" Queen-album. A couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many Best of Queen-releases. "A Winters' Tale" for example. Do I know much about the background for "Made in Heaven", well perhaps not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release. Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with "Made in heaven"? Was this really Freddie Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic "Innuendo" released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad "These are the days of our lives". The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song, have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie, and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them.  But is "Made in Heaven" really that bad? Yes, and no. "Heaven for everyone" by Roger Taylor made it sound promising, and don't forget; I was exited when I heard about "a final material"-release. But it turned out, as you might have guessed, far from what I had expected. Old songs from B-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... I mean honestly? "Too much love..." then quite a resent hit from Brian Mays' solo-album "Back to the light", I remember thinking "What's the point?" And it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here. Don't get me wrong now, Freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect, it's what they've made out it that surprises me. And what makes me wish they hadn't. At least not for an entire album.   "A winters' tale" is a positive surprise though. Perhaps not Freddies' best song, and not better than "These are the days...". But it's a celebration of the beauty in life. At least it sounds like that to me. Freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. And beauty. And it sounds like a classic Queen-song! "A beautiful day (intro and reprise)" functions well too. But what tracks 12 and 13 are about I have absolutely no idea..? I wish they would have ended the album with Freddies' last "Yeah!" on the song. I wish...  So all in all; "Innuendo" remains the explosive good-bye with the "real" Queen. At least it does to me.  (Let me add that the cover of "Made in Heaven" is perfect for the title, and somehow amazingly "seals" in its' simplicity the fate of the band with Freddie in the lead. The three band members left (Brian, Roger, John) facing the sunset, and a statue capturing Freddie in a remembarable style on stage. Reminding me of him at Wembley 86. To me this actually expresses something beyond words, and it's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to "Heaven for everyone" or "A winters' tale".)     
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 It is really difficult to believe that Giles, er, ah, the Rev. Giles is a pastor. He touts himself as a "theologian" and big game hunter (tough guy), but the proof, as Ma used to say, is in the pudding (Okay, Ma wasn't entirely original). The pudding for a preacher is his sermon, a radio talk show host his radio talk show (Oh, hum...), and the written word his book. Of late the Rev. Giles churns them little cupcakes out, and while they may have some mass appeal to that fringe of the church-going Right who barely skim the headlines let alone a few verses in their Bibles, he does not persuade an audience barely over the line from the sanctified few to the secularized many. But perhaps that's the audience he does not want to reach, i.e., the unregenerate and reprobate, those predestined to damnation. Theologian Giles weighs in with his commentary on the book of Daniel and in typical Evangelical fashion, skews it to young people using his youthful slang lingo to capture the hearts [and minds] of his readers. But theologian Giles does a poor job of setting the historical and literary context, something that a seminary graduate such as himself should easily be able to do. Instead we are given hip-slogans, a white-man's-jive, and strained applications. If Giles' approach in his book(s) mirrors that of his Sunday morning sermons, no doubt he is using a silly outline in a PowerPoint presentation where his devotees follow along and fill in the blanks. By way of a Scriptural illustration, while new believers will crave the "milk" of the word, they must necessarily in time crave the "meat" of the word. As the writer who penned those words suggests, to crave the milk only and not the meat, is evidence of immaturity and non-growth. The idea is that believers must be challenged to grow and not stay in their immaturity. A first reading of this book convinced me that the Rev. Giles is not attempting to move his readers from immaturity to maturity, but rather, as German theologians (real ones) would say, is merely addressing their zits um leben (present life situation). While addressing one's current life situation may be important, as Platonic as it may sound (for those of you in seminary, Plato was a philosopher), it is important for any teacher to strongly move his pupils (readers here) from their current state to the place in which they should be. That's called "stretching" in acting: as a good director will force an actor to stretch in self-discovery, a good teacher (preacher) and writer should seek to stretch his readers. Rev. Giles, in my view, has let his readers down (the frozen chosen), and has once again opened up the Christian movement to scorn and derision from the very audience that we, as Christians, are called to reach. And so it goes 
 The movie itself was pretty good - however, there is a good chance this movie will not play in your DVD player.  Sony added a new copy protection scheme to this DVD which causes the movie to be unplayable in many DVD players.  Many different players from different manufacturers are affected.  I learned of this problem after it did not work in my RCA DVD player, and searched on the internet and found many others with the same problem.  So, there is a good chance that this movie will not be playable, and I don't recommend purchasing it 
 Sure there's some excellent artwork in this picture book. But instead of being an artistic guide to the ships of the Star Trek universe, 'Ships Of The Line' ends up being more like a photo album (albeit artist-rendered) of the central ship of each of the Star Trek television series. This is not anything close to a comprehensive spotter's book for the various Federation and alien space craft like the book's dust jacket suggests, which is EXACTLY the sort of book a Trekkie geek like me was expecting. Instead, this book lays out like a scrap book of the various iterations of U.S.S. Enterprises as it appeared on the various series and in film, the Defiant from DS9 and of course Voyager. Too few of the art panels focus on other ships in the Star Fleet inventory, or from any of the alien races that makes the Star Trek shows as rich and embellished as they were.  Too small to be a real coffee table book, and too lacking in the sort of minutiae information a Trek trivia fan craves to be useful as a real Star Trek reference guide, 'Ships Of The Line' needs to head back to the literary version of space dry dock for a content refit 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 I bought this one because I want to better research the subject of vaccination before I have kids, but I didn't find anything credible here. Allen simply wants to tell his opinion and skew stats toward his point of view. True, there's a good story here and it's actually entertaining, but I encountered so many half-truths and so much misinformation that I had to put the book down.  And I couldn't even recommend it for it's entertainment value because of the fact that so many things there are blatant lies. For instance, in a passage where he was talking about Franz Kafka meeting Rudolf Steiner he says, "Steiner picked his nose throughout the whole conversation and Kafka was disgusted." Well I own Kafka's diaries and here's what Kafka actually wrote, "At first a quiet head cold disturbed him (Steiner), his nose ran, he kept working his hankerchief deep into his nostril one finger at a time." (page 49) And that's it. Kafka says nothing else about it.   So the guy had a head cold and was using a hankerchief, but because Rudolf Steiner had a different position on vaccines than Allen, he is portrayed as a nosepicker so as to lose credibility. There's soooo many pieces of data that he spins in order to support his position, but you know what,that's done by many people today who just want to sell a book. But it's a shame that even in the stories themselves the guy in not credible. Stay away from this one.  UPDATE 4/6/07: Arthur Allen himself left a comment for my review, and not only denied lying about what I called him on, but lied yet again (I'm not making this up...it's all readable on my comments page.) 
 This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. I definitely think it had the potential to be good. What I didn't like was that you didn't really get to know the characters. I felt like an outsider while watching this film. I think if the writers had started out the film showing us the characters as kids at camp then it would have been easier to identify with them. I also thought the actor who played "Uncle Lou" was awful. His acting stunk, although I thought all the others were good. I have fond memories of summer camp so I think the concept of a camp reunion is good, but this one bombed. No wonder it isn't wasn't very popular. I hope a better summer camp movie comes out soon. 
 the layout of this book is fine, but the printing is poor, the color is just not there...Rothko's work always evoke something in me when i look at it, but the coloring is so bad that it was just like looking at black and white rectangles in this book. Very disappointed. (refer to paper back edition 
 First, the reason for one star is a reminder to leave Pinter's plays to others.  I read the "The Birthday Party," and, "The Room," and may or may not read the rest of the plays.  Informatively I am an avid reader with a vast collection.  The Birthday Party and The Room did not have one redeeming feature. I could not believe that anything written could be so bad.  In my opinion both were absolute garbage and I wonder how and why in the first place it was every published. When I finished reading this nonsense a thought came to mind as follows: If a monkey was placed by a computer keyboard and was allowed to   go crazy hitting the keys, the result would probably be, "The Birthday Party and The Room.  Since I was punished enough reading the above, reading the rest of the plays would only compound my bewilderment and disappointment in choosing this book.  If this book was offered to a publisher by a writer other than Harold Pinter and the editor read the first two plays, if he read that far, which I doubt, he would have thrown the book in his waste basket followed by an oath.  Unfortunately, I purchased a couple of the Pinter Books from Amazon.com and will check them out only because I purchased them   and am curious to learn if they are as bad a read as the one I reviewed.

 This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the "child-like" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.  It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally "unconscience" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda 
 This is an interesting premise (that's why I bought it) and an awful read. As characters, the saurians had no appeal to make me care what happened to them and, frankly, neither did the humans.  I was longing for Enya, the "26-million-year death-star" to reduce the whole bunch of them to a fine powder 
 There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book.  We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists.  Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are:  Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair  If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley  Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage by Anne Kristin Carroll   They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband 
 I guess I expected more out of this movie but I confess I was mildly disappointed in it. At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable.  
 The other books in this series were OK. I found this book too slow paced to stay interested for long. It was very easy to put the book aside in favor of other books. I think the reason Fleur Monley desired the 'white marriage' was a weak excuse considering the extent of her fear. When her reason was revealed I thought,"That's all?" As for Dante, I didn't care for him much. He seemed too juvenile to me. He was very irresponsible. While this book isn't awful, the others in the series are better. The only real reason I can see to read this book is that the reader would want to finish up the entire series, not leaving a book unread 
 The back of the CD case says "newly remastered from the original analog tapes" and "features the full-length version of Roll Over Beethoven" but it's a BALD-FACED LIE! This disc is simply a clone of the heavily noise reduced and badly EQ'd "First Light" remaster that came out in the UK a few years ago. In other words, if you already have that disc, you won't need this one. You will need to hang onto the old US pressing of this album to get the TRUE "Full Length Version" of Roll Over Beethoven, and the best sound quality, as well as the US artwork! Sony, and everybody involved with this reissue, should be ashamed of themselves 
 Unfortunately I also purchased this product and within a few uses I began getting cracks in all my containers.  Plastic is very thin and is very low quality, not what I had expected from Black & Decker.  Both continers broke within a week, used only a couple of times...  I would rate this product a ZERO if it would let me 
 Wissing accomplished the task of flattening the Himalayas with his two dimensional portrayal of the Sheltons, the Chinese, the Tibetans, and the continent of Asia.  He glossed over the Unequal Treaties, Opium War, or any other conflicts with the West that would cast doubt on the altruistic motives of the missionaries and ruin his "feel good" story.  The book lacked any perspective to place the Sheltons in, and thereby deprived a lot of their work of meaning.  I was left with no clue that they rode out a two revolutions, that Dr. Shelton was a great diplomat, or even how high up Tibet is, other than an occasional sideways reference.  There was a lot of potential for a very good and interesting book about Dr. Shelton, but either by accident or intent it was left with the substance of a "Chicken Soup" book 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 I bought this for my 12 year old who so far hasn't been able to get it to play.  (I haven't either)  Before giving up on it, we have to retrieve the directions from his grandmother's house and read them thoroughly.  I'm disapointed since Coby's have a good reputation 
 I guess it depends on why you read this book, but if you want to know what to do in your home, don't waste your money on this one.  She does a good job of telling the history of Feng Shui and lots of little anecdotes about  the successful uses of it, but no good practical ways to use it for your  own benefit.  It didn't do a thing for me 
 My review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently.  For some months after I first bought the card, it worked great.  Now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my Canon Elph, and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card.  Judging by what other customers have written, I'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between Canon cameras and Viking cards.  In any case, I will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a Viking 
 This may be an effective, helpful book; however, I could not make it through the first chapter as a result of the countless references made towards Christian values and God.  Let me say that I have absolutely nothing against a person who wishes to preach the word of God.  On the contrary, I am encouraged by those who believe this is their calling.  Unfortunately, I did not purchase this book to be inspired; I purchased this book to understand the author's perception of valuable communication skills.  If this book were titled, "Communication Plus:  How to be a Good Christian Speaker so People Will Listen" I would better understand the author's perspective 
 Reading other reviews of this movie I am surprised that I am the only one who felt pretty offended by this movie. I read the book just a while ago and loved it. So, I was excited about seeing the movie. Big let down!  First of all they change one of the main character's names and for no good reason that I can see. There is no relation between the Allison McKenzie of the book and the one in the movie--they are completely differenct characters!   When I read the book, I felt that I was reading a serious piece of literature that was uncovering a small town's egotistical, self-important view of itself which, let's face it, is pretty common in many human societies. Metalious was making a  commentary on how her community was repressive of individuality and free expression. The movie seemed more concerned with whether Lana Turner's character was ever going to get a little action. Moreover, the most commonly used words in reviews of the movie are melodrama and soap opera. Now, when I think of melodrama and soap opera I think of Dallas, Days of our lives and 90210. Basically, trash that presents mindless, unbelievable situations.   Metalious' book was done a grave injustice by this movie. I am still trying to figure out how she was a script consultant and allowed this to get to film 
 Its amazing with all the resources of 911 Commission at their disposal, they could not find an operational link between Hussein and al Qaeda. If the Commission could only get the Bush/Cheney team to testify under oath, there wouldn`t even be a debate.  Perhaps Hayes should spend time reading their final  report which claimed there was no link between Iraq and 911. But Hayes like his other conservative peers have a gift of throwing half truth and innuendo at their faith based readers to come to ludicrous conclusions.   
 I was disappointed with "Missing Men." I was expecting to find bits of insight, perhaps a pearl of wisdom here and there, something to connect with and relate to, being an artist, having been a single mother, having loved intensely, surely these were things that connections are made of....and yet I am left with the sensation of this being a fairly dry and remote recital of Johnson's family & relationship history.  I felt she was more of an impersonal narrator rather than intimately and emotionally involved with her story.  I finished the book wondering why Johnson had written it, what was her point, what did she want to convey to me with her memoirs?  What did I gain by reading it?  Nothing, I'm afraid.  I compare this with "Too Close to the Falls" by Catherine Gildiner... both set in New York, both describing their childhoods (well, I guess that's a prerequiste of a memoir, isn't it)... Johnson's book left me dutifully turning the pages to finish it, to get it over with... just the opposite of Gildiner's book, I hated to see it end.  Why did one bore me and another interest me?  I have no answer for that, perhaps it's entirely due to my psyche and has nothing to do with the authors.  But this is not something I'm adding to my recommended reading list 
 This book is not great, really not great.  It is decent, but not nearly what I was expecting.  The cover says that it is a highlight reel from Sex and the City, one of my very favorite shows, but it was so opposite of SaTC, that I can't even understand the comparison.  The main character doesn't live in NYC, and doesn't write a column about sex, but does write a column.  It's about a girl, one who hates her evangelical Christian background, so she has sex with a couple guys, but it isn't about loving the man, it's about wanting not to be a Christian.  I finished it to find out what ends up happening, but I was REALLY dissapointed.  Don't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you don't hate evangelical Christians 
 I use Plone a lot in my job and I bought both this book and The Definitive Guide to Plone by Andy Mc Kay.  I find this book to be confusing at best, maybe because it tries to cover too much ground. When it describes the portlets, it goes on for SIX pages describing each portlet, with a screen capture for each portlet! It talks about REST for over a page, although this architecture has really nothing to do with Plone. Etc. Etc.  All in all, it seems to me that too many technical editors have worked on this book, making it overly technical and complicated. Even the font they use make the content look cluttered! It is very difficult to write something clear and simple, especially for a very piece of technical software such as Plone. In my humble opinion, this book has failed in that regard.  I almost never use this book on my everyday job. Get Andy Mc Kay's book, you'll get a much better value for your money 
 Very disappointed!!  I am a very busy mom who tries very hard to cook healthy & low cal for the whole family.  When I buy a cookbook that claims it's quick & easy, I do not expect the recipes to have an average of 15 to 20 ingredients in them.  I don't know what this author considers quick, but I sure don't think there is anything quick about these recipes!  No pictures either 
 I have never read dialogue so contrived in my entire life. The tension between Adam and Becca had not point of origin. The tension between Adam and Tyler was stereotypical, to say the least. The way the author ridded the characters and reader of any residual guilt/frustration/regret in regards to Tyler was totally unrealistic and disgustingly half-hearted. Such a cop out! The entire "love" story was based on notions of "Gee, you're hot! I wanna have sex with you! We must be in love!" When, at a rather crucial moment Adam said "Even my molecules are horny" I stood up, threw the book across the room, and laughed for ten mintues straight. I didn't keep it or sell it; I threw it in the bin where it belongs. It was utter trash 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 Solutions are sometimes even more abstruse than the problems and concepts themselves.  Someone got lazy writing out these solutions!  Plus, more than half the problems are not solved in this book.  Not worth $34 in my opinion 
 Regrettably, I found the book's condition was too old, which I paid $37 including delivery charge. In school, I also found a used book, looking like a new book, was sold at $40. 
 Ive been a manowar fan for about 20 years, maybe i havent listened to anything more than this band ... i am really disapointed, i find my way to listen to it yesterday (tired of waiting for my amazon cd to arrive, it's been a month since they "send it"), back to the album, the songs never starts, and when you think manowar riffs are comming to stay, they went down again. Lot's of intros and talking ... and the worst is that the intros sound like a cheap electric organ, no intros with plain guittar and with eric entering the song in a magestic way ... only choruses of repeated voices... this album is terrible, worst of manowar by far. 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 This book is only low to moderately useful to gamers that have been around for a while. If you are new to the game it may prove useful but the DMG has more than enough information as compared to this book. Cityscape provided better information and examples and led me to believe that this would be a quality product as well, I was wrong. If you are a collector or just have to have every book published by WoTC then I suggest you get it used and save a little money 
 While comprehensive, this is too broad, too general and very stereotypical.  Each 'cultural' group represented in the United States has the same diet as their fellows, it seems.  It can also be very bland:  since coming to the U.S., X group's consumption of 'junk' food, milk, and such, has increased.  There are also some serious mistakes.  Scotch is the alcoholic drink while Scottish refers to the people.  Yet, the authors insist on calling a particular people the "Scotch Irish" (a group not recognized in Europe).  Should you want very general information, without consulting specialist sources, this might be adequate for your purposes, but if it is to be used in, say, a course introducing topics of food and culture, this is not the book to use 
 Perhaps in the first time in the publishing industry, a former president had to refund a portion of the advance for his memoirs due to its falling short of expectations of the publisher. That is all that needs to be said about A Time To Heal.  Gerald R. Ford stumbled into the presidency in the same way comic Chevy Chase panned him in skits on SNL. Embattled Pres. Richard Nixon needed a mark to make sure he could shuffle out of the Oval Office without the threat of being prosecuted for crimes & misdemeanors, and Ford was the man.  The book is short on detailed facts concerning the issue of the pardon and staggers through the key points of the times - the fall of Saigon and the 1976 Republican primary that basically undid his presidency - like a running back on a soggy field and wearing the wrong cleats for proper traction.  Ford should have had the courage to take a pen in hand and truly write a major piece on the tumolt that defined his brief presidency. The book publisher certainly expected more. But I guess that sketches short on facts are what should have been expected from an individual who truly defined the term, "Beltway Insider."    
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 I was expecting a total new book to use in my classroom around Halloween. This one seems to reprint information from her first two books including some information on locations that is not correct. Has she actually been to any of those locations, I was misled. If your looking for a book on folklore than this is for you,otherwise save your money if you have her first two books.    
 I am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications.  I found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point.  The author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue, which I find a bit tiresome.  The text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff.  Definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text.  I suspect I am the wrong target audience 
 This book is nothing but a good marketing ploy. Nothing worth reading in it. Been there, done that. Next 
 I have read everybook Karen Kingsbury has written and I have to say that I struggled to finish this one. Most of her books are written with many plot lines, this book sad to say was very slow and boring. She attempted to make so much out of one thought and it did not work well. I hope that she returns to her previous style of writing. I would not recommend this book to anyone if that had not read her before. I am positive that they would be "left deflated. 
 This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen. Firstly, this book is putatively "written" by a snotnose who some neo-con writer probably thought would serve as a great marketing schtick. I mean, are we expected to believe that this kid has anything insightful or informative to say about the American media?? C'mon, people, go read McLuhan or something.    Secondly, WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? As far as I can tell, even the liberals in the media are afraid to "rock the boat." They're ineffectual nothings who haven't practiced truly investigative reporting in decades (except for Seymour Hersch... much props). They operate as a collective unit of nebbishes, but at least they are the conservative media. By the way, Fox News is the number one news channel on cable television, so don't tell me that liberals control the media. There're plenty of people who watch the conservative crap proposing to be news. Wow, the American populace is dumb. THINK, FOLKS, THINK!! (NB: Yes, I'm an angry, but mostly objective, liberal 
 Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today. 
 I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John) 
 The book wants to take totally out of fundaments information and data to portrait a totally false perspective. The Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is just an inexplicable gift from the Lord. We as Catholics do NOT consider the Virgin as God to be worshipped. We recognize her importance on the history of Salvation and for this reason we honor her. The image currently present in Mexico City is just a wonderful "picture" that has not scientific explanation and it doesn't include any magic or Aztecs mysticism 
 When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash 
 i'm a nora roberts fan, so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to. after reading "born in fire", i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in "born in ice".  brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict, and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling, she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm. she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can't create further conflict, even if she burns with anger inside. she's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own. after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story, she thinks she'll never have what she dreams of.  she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess. she's always hospitable to her guests. she's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden, two places she loves to be. although she's surrounded by folks who love her, she's still lonely.  and then comes grayson, the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland. he's one who lives in the moment, ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create.  the characters compliment each other well. they're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn't feel loved. she's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he's not. that's where the conflict comes to play.   and that's kinda where i've got a problem with the book. this is supposed to be a guy who doesn't want emotional ties, yet early in the book he's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her. there simply wasn't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down. there was very little if any sexual tension here, and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension. a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed. and even then, it seemed like he wasn't really fighting himself for being there. there simply wasn't enough of an inner conflict within him. it all seemed like lukewarm resistance.  and brianna was simply a saint. i would have liked to see her emote a little more. i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts, but i don't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler. at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson.   there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end. i will say that the ending was sweet. also, it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from "born in fire".  i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer's imagination, as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect. however, if you're looking for a "can't put down" romance novel, this ain't it 
 I should let you know that I have heard all of Badly Drawn Boy's early EPs and I own all of his studio albums. I consider him one of my favorite musicians. That is why I am incredibly disappointed with Badly Drawn Boy's latest full-length, Born In The UK. This is just an appallingly awful CD. Having thoroughly enjoyed all of Badly Drawn Boy's previous work, I never would have imagined him capable of a CD this bad. I'm shocked and disappointed.   I don't know what happened to Badly Drawn Boy. I personally think his best album was the soundtrack to About A Boy. Have You Fed The Fish and One Plus One were enjoyable, but I started to get the feeling he was treading water a bit. Well, with Born In The UK, Badly Drawn Boy has given up trying to stay afloat. Damon Gough has completely lost all of his talent for writing lyrics. Born In The UK features some of the tritest, cliched, cringe-inducing MOR lyrics since James Blunt was dumped upon the listening public. It's just embarrassing.   If you are a big Badly Drawn Boy fan, you'll probably be offended by this review and want to own the CD regardless of its inferior quality. Have fun with it. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. If, however, you have a limited amount of money to spend on music, I would thoroughly encourage you to spend your money on a better release. 
 In her book, Kathleen Brown offers a revision of colonial Virginia history. Relying almost entirely upon previously known and explored primary materials, she constructs an argument that gender heavily influenced colonial development.        Breaking her book up chronologically into three parts, Brown focuses first on England and the Virginia colony's early days. In discussing the former, she establishes the role of women who adhere to social behavioral norms as that of good wives, and those who do not adhere to those norms as nasty wenches. In the case of Virginia, she explores the role of women in English society vis a vis Powhatan's Algonquian society. When Powhatan offered women to English settlers, whether for marriage or a night's enjoyment, he did so for political reasons; the settlers, however, thought Indians valued women less, and differently, than they did. Settlers further grappled with the fact that women farmed while men, they thought, took it easy, hunting and fishing.        The second part focuses on the change in roles of women, and the corresponding change in how men though of them. As Virginia became more permanent, and as slaves became more prevalent, "good wives" came to mean the elite women, whereas "nasty wenches" meant servant or non-elite women. Following Bacon's Rebellion, this labeling shifted somewhat as elite men attempted to break the unofficial alliance between black slaves and white servants. Principally, the violations of white women that formerly would have made them nasty wenches now were less serious, while those same violations of black women were more so.        The last part explores the domination of men and the lives of elite women. Men became much more patriarchal, establishing social norms and laws to that effect. They were "anxious" in the sense that they were now required to hold domination over their wives, families, and farms, and maintain strict adherence to those norms and laws. Relying heavily on the writings of William Byrd II and Landon Carter, Brown points out the fears these men had of declining virility, disobedient sons, and the like. Women, meanwhile, came together against their husbands, quietly undermining them on occasions, especially in discipline issues, and generally developing a women's society of tea parties and such.        On the one hand, Brown's revisionist attempt is a worthwhile endeavor; only the foolish would say women had no role or impact whatsoever in colonial development. As historians have largely ignored or downplayed this role, her study is therefore relevant. On the other hand, she delves far too deeply into the sex lives of leading men. Her study was not one solely of the role of gender, but also of sexuality. To a certain and very limited extent that exploration is worthwhile-certainly the colonists were concerned with fornication, bastardy and the like-but do I, the reader, really need to know on which days Byrd gave his wife a "flourish," and whether or not he was "vigorous"? No. Furthermore, certain inherent flaws exist in a reinterpretation that relies heavily on modern and liberal views of sex and sexuality. Consequently, there are certain aspects of the book that are worth reading, but one should select those aspects carefully. 
 At the moment Extreme sat on stools and strummed the opening bars to this drivel for all the sentimental fools that were gullable enough to but this, they put the final nail into the rock scene coffin. Sure, other bands played ballads, but MTW was the final straw.  How could good time, long haired, fun rock n' roll ever be able to show it's face in public after this drivel?  We were having a tough enough time with Seattle Grunge making us all miserable and wanting to shoot ourselves, but once this went mainstream we had had it.  If you had long hair and tatoos people equated you with Extreme and More Than Words.  Extreme had such promise and their first two albums showed that there was life after Van Halen, but then they got greedy and ruined it.  If Gary Cherone claimed to have meant even one of those words, he is a liar.  He was a great performer and one of the best front men of the era, but he sold us all out and for that reason I will never forgive hi 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 I usually try to at least finish a book but this one was impossible!  I had to give up at page 180-something, I had had enough.  I will not even circulate it to my friends.  Thank god someone gave it to me and I didn't pay for it 
 I was fortunate enough to see Amor Real on Univision.  It is a magnificate historial romantic novel.  However, the DVD does it no justice.  It runs from one event to the other without any background, it is just a series of previews. They are important characters that do not talk. Once you have seen the real thing this shortened version makes no sense.  I was so disappointed that I cried.  I would like to have all 95 episods so that I can view them for the rest of my life.  The original was wonderful, the DVDs are disappointing.  I do not know how anyone would understand it 
 I've used the Palm OS going on 10 years now.  When my Treo 270 died, I bought a used 270 on Ebay.  Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.    I called Palm "tech support" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).   He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.  I then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.  Finally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.  As I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their "support".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.   As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).  IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.  ....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... : 
 I bought this book with much enthusiasm after reading reviews since I wanted to study more about power animals and be able to share some information with others.  Well, there are no water animals except "whale", "dolphin" and "seal" so when we looked up fish, crab, octopus, and frog, we found nothing.  My power animal is the cockatoo - well, there was not even parrot to look up. Bottom line, there are only 36 animals with information.  For those of you who believe in totem animals and power animals, you know that for each person, there may be several animals to look up.  This book is not for those who are looking for a complete selection (obviously, within each species you find so many but it would be nice to at least list the main categories).    "Native beliefs explain that a totem animal is one that is with you for life, often an animal with whom you share a connection, either through interest in the animal or your resemblance to or shared characteristics of the animal in question. A power animal or spirit animal is a spirit in animal form that comes through with a specific lesson for you, and will change throughout the course of your life." 
 Someone like John Berendt, former editor of New York magazine, reminds me of why I left Manhattan, with its small-mided delusional ego-centrism. He's an unskilled writer and thinker, with the soulful depth of a gossip columnist. Pick your favorite town or city, and imagine someone spinning the news-making personalities (University heads, retired CEO's, Mayors, developers, elites and gold-diggers) into a porttrait of your town, coated with a pretense of depth through literary references. You'd be incensed. Most people don't care about the trials of the rich and famous (maybe 10% of the population does, enough to keep books like this successful) -- they care about real stuff, like life, death, happiness, meaningful work, family etc. There's nothing important here. This is not Venice today, and the inhabitants of the city are right to ignore the book 
 I had to read this book for my highschool literature class. Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. This book put me to sleep. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Trojan War chapter which I wished was longer. It was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. I only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time 
 When I received this book for Christmas and read the back, I was excited to read it, but that quickly fell away as I started to read the first few chapters.  The author starts out stating that she is a journalist and promises an unbiased view of Wicca. However, increasingly through out the book her own Christian views show up in her writing. She portrays Wiccan/Pagans as mostly being feminists trying to escape from the church. I don't recall reading one time that Wiccans or Pagans are such because they believe in their religion. She also focuses a good deal on drug use and sexual rites. I am a Pagan. I do not use drugs or practice sexual rites. I do not practice Wicca; however, I have talked to many Wiccans and Pagans of all different beliefs and not one uses sexual rites nor do most of them use drugs. While I do not deny that there are people out there who do such, the way she portrays Pagans in her book is very narrow. I do not feel she went digging deep enough for her information, because I can not relate myself or others I've conversed with to the people in her book.   I found her writing to have an over all "but" feeling to it. Meaning she would generally say that she wanted Christians to understand Wiccans and Pagans, BUT it's her narrow view and on the B side, she wanted the Pagans to read why they should give up their "grudge" be Christians. Never does she delve into the specific beliefs of Pagans or bring up the fact that some people may not believe the story of Christ in the Christian way.   I would never reccomend this book to any Christian or person of another faith trying to understand Paganism or Wicca. Why not just pick up one of the highly ranked Wiccan/Pagan/Druid/etc. books on Amazon and make your own opinion?  
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 To quote the book, "Those of our readers who expect to find lists comprising all the various scales of color, giving definite information as to what particular color should be used to harmonize with this or that shade, and telling just what combinations  are allowable, and just what are to be condemned, will, therefore, be disappointed."  This book covers how to prime wood and mix colors (reddish brown color is achieved by mixing Indian red and burnt umber) and does give specific color schemes.  This is a reprint from 1883, and the authors mentioned that the printer could not replicate most of the color schemes they envisioned (maybe I need to get watercolor paint and mix the suggested colors to see what they intended).  We are building a Victorian home, and I was looking for ideas of what worked well in the past, but the rust red, dark mustard yellow, greens and browns they showed did not inspire me as I had hoped.  It does have helpful information about color selection, but it is fairly generic in nature.  Most of the plates are house exteriors, but there are a few interior plates as well. 
 This book does not offer much more than the Sun J2EE Tutorial online does and that is free. I have worked through the first two weeks, and I have decided to shelve it. The book starts strong with the JNDI. There are plenty of code listings for you to type in and try with good explanations on naming, binding, and lookup. After this the book is nothing more than a rehash of the Sun Online tutorial with a different larger example application. The application is complete. You don't do anything but read about the design and pertinent Java technologies that are being used for that particular part of the application. Then you are given instructions on how to deploy the current working piece of the application on the J2EE RI, and run sample clients against it - chapter after chapter of the same thing. Though this type of learning by reading some one else code with explanations seems to be enjoyed by some. I side with Ivor Horton. Programming is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Having the reader build the application and participate in the process would have made for a better learning experience of a complex topic 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 After reading this book, I would have to say Michael Apple did a wonderful job using examples to describe how modern public schools in the United States are flawed. He also did a good job introducing ideas, which might have been alien to many people, regarding elements of public education in America. However, it seems he spends too much time on the tautology of blaming Republicans for the misfortunes and pratfalls of present pedagogy. One must remember that Democrats and Republicans are both cut from the same cloth. In addition, if Apple wants to scream bloody murder about how many blemishes that Republicans have caused public education, he needs to remember that Democrats really have not made it any better. The "No Child Left Behind" act is something that both the left and the right support, and after working in public education for over a year, I can tell you this act really does not work.  Apple does explain notions of Channel One and product placement in public schools, which then dictates curriculum. He also goes into detail about how the media influences education and contemporary society. Nevertheless, he spends more time pointing fingers and telling you what is wrong. However, he never expresses any lucid or tangible means to ameliorate this quagmire facing our youth and public education.   There is a fine line between making a wonderful argument and whining like a baby. Apple does a great job performing the latter. Mind you, Republicans are not perfect politicians by any stretch of the imagination. Just look at some of the things that have happened over the past few years. Yet, Apple's diatribe seems more like whimpering, instead of fighting back, or addressing a solution to all the things, he is complaining about. Overall, this is an interesting read, but Apple is nowhere near the philosophical icon of John Dewey.   
 First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book,  each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.  What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of "telephone."   You know "telephone" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?  Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.  While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts 
 Wow. I was shocked. Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' Is it not disingenuous for Mr. Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus? He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the "patronizing nonsense" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, "...a religionless Christianity must be born." Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been deceased and not around to defend himself.  I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.  I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.  Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Mr. Spong) to refer to the words I have just said in this paragraph and convincingly argue: "You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...etc., etc."  I offer one piece of advice. However, I base this advice on my beliefs that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.    
 I love most of Mary McCarthy, but in my opinion, this is her weakest book.  It covers basically the same territory as Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, which she wrote in the 1950s.  Here, however, there's little trace of her signature, tightly-wrought style.  Instead, the style is baggy, with convoluted sentences, chatty asides, digressions within digressions, and endless lists of books she read, names of friends, etc.  As a result, I often lost track of the basic story - which, after all, was the exact same story she had already told in Memories of a Catholic Girlhood.  I'm rather confused as to why McCarthy wrote this book at all.  Given that she had already written a detailed memoir of her formative years, why not just skip ahead to the mid-1930s, the subject of her unfinished "Intellectual Memoirs" 
 This book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  The beginning was quite exceptional.  I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  We set the book down and did not finish it.  If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  Sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.  
 Out of all the Star Wars books i've read this was the worst one.  The only reason i gave it 2 stars is becase of the art work.  I you really want a book on the universe check out The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
  This is just an awful battery.  It came as the OEM battery on my Panasonic KX-TG2267 phone.  The P-P511 appears to have been used to power a host of other Panasonic cordless phones as well.   The battery quickly stopped holding a charge.    I looked for alternatives, and got an Eveready ER-P511 NiMH battery, which at 1200 mAH, is a slight improvement.  But hey, most NiMH AA batteries are way better than that these days!    So I decided to make my own battery, out of some 2500 mAH Eveready Energizer NiMH AA batteries.  It's not that hard.  Here's how you do it:   First of all, save the original P-P511 battery that came with your phone.  Study it.  The P-P511 battery is essentially made of three AA batteries linked together in series.   Linking batteries in series just requires that the minus pole of one battery contact the positive pole of the next battery, and so on.  These links can be made by using wires or strips of metal.  Take an Exacto knife or something similar and cut/peel away the outer plastic wrap of the battery.  The bottom part of this old battery will have a hard plastic frame that holds the three AA batteries together.  Save this plastic frame for re-use.  Next, note how the original three AA batteries are linked together.  The alignment of the three batteries is such that the one on the left will have the minus pole down, the one in the middle will also have the minus pole down, and the one on the right will have the positive pole down.   The plastic holder has two holes, one in the middle, and one on the right side to allow the middle battery's minus pole to contact the handset's spring leads, and the right side battery's positive pole to contact the handset's spring leads.  OK, so now all you've got to do is figure out how to hook up the batteries in series so that these two battery poles end up at each end of this daisy chain series.    Take heavy duty packing tape and some heavy duty aluminum foil (the kind that comes in the large heavy duty lengths work fine), and cut small 1/4 inch strips.   Tape the end of one such aluminum strip to the minus pole of what will be the left hand battery.  Run this aluminum strip flush along the body of the left battery to the other end of the battery, and tape the other end of the aluminum strip to the positive pole of the middle battery.  Next, tape these two batteries to the plastic frame holder and cover up the aluminum foil generously with some of the packing tape.  The next aluminum strip needs to run directly over the positive pole of the middle battery without making any electrical contact with it, so the positive pole of this middle battery needs to be well covered with tape and insulated.  So, tape down one end of a strip of aluminum foil to the top minus pole of the right hand battery, and run the foil strip across the top of the middle battery, and make contact with the bare positive pole of the left hand battery.  Tape dowm the aluminum foil to the top of the left hand battery.  Tape the right hand battery to the other two batteries and the frame, and then wrap the whole group of three batteries in tape again, just to make sure the whole thing stays together.  Voila!  You've made your own P-P511 battery!  
 ...and unfortunately, this book is shallow as well. Arnoldi's book deals with surfaces and appearances, and she makes a good point from it. The characters are shallow people who destroy their self-indulgent lives.   However, it's a bit too shallow for me. The sexual perversity was probably meant to spice things up, but, oddly enough, it didn't. We're given a throwaway reason for Charles' behaviour (mommy didn't pay enough attention to him) and a laundry list of reasons why he's a weasel. There was no connection, though. I didn't loathe him or find him disgusting or sad...I didn't find anything there at all. He was as thin as cardboard. So was Aurora. They could have used some of the detail that she used on Amy (the daughter) and her old trainer.   The ending was amusing, and it would have been satisfying had there been any depth. I found myself held off by shiny surfaces. This may have been thematically intentional, but it doesn't make for a good read.   I finished it, but wouldn't read it twice. 
 The idea for the book has great potential--and some of the children's letters are very cute--but the book itself is simply too thin to merit the rave reviews that others have given it. I was disappointed that the book had so little material and it would be hard for me to recommend it at the published price 
 Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts?  THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD.  Not the shows that are still on air 
 This gal is taking Weight Watchers to court.  I wouldn't suggest anyone waste a penny buying this dribble whe writes 
 I was looking for something that would put the key information in simpler terms without all the extra wording that goes into a code book for legal/political reasons.  It may be useful to some but not to me 
 This movie really made no sense.  First off, there is no haunting. Second, there's no witch. Third, if the incidents were caused by a poltergeist, (i.e., the girl herself) why in the world was she torturing herself at first and not the person she really wanted revenge on.  And why would it take a year after the first "incident" for the poltergeist attacks to occur.  The opening, with the modern girl running in the woods from something was way too long and set the tone of the film: a lot of cheesy quasi terror scenes that don't make much sense and end up being boring.  I love haunted house stories, but this was not one of those. There are far better haunting stories on Discovery's "A Haunting" series. Why is it that big budget films always seem to have lousy lame scripts which the directors try to compensate for by overproduction 
 The best essay in this short collection is by Nobel prize winner Robert Solow, who points out the main fault of so called feminist economics: it is tangential stuff. This is obvious in reading the collection of essays which focus more on Institutional Economics (a branch of sociology), rhetoric, and anthropology. Most of the contributors buzz around the issue of the (patriarchal) family and use Gary Becker, another (very undeserving) Nobel prize winner as their whipping boy. But Becker's work on the economics of sleep and such like is also tangential. This slim tome strikes me as an exercise in academic vanity publishing. The inclusion of Donald McCloskey, who got a sex change operation since it was published, reinforces that. Economics has a myriad of failings and short comings but having it colonized by even softer and shallower social "sciences" is not the answer. The contributors devote some space to explaining that their type of work is regard as sciences in most languages, English being the big exception. That seems to be where they are at: kitchen arguments, ignoring facts and solid axioms in favor of doctrine. 
 Very disappointed because I can't watch it on my DVD player. I would have asked for a refund and returned it but don't know how to go about doing that on Amazon 
 While I believe that Robert C. Solomon is a wonderful writer and presents the difficult to understand information on Philosophy in an easy to understand way, I do not agree with this book. He does not give any credit to God at all; for example, in the chapter called "Self," Solomon writes, "One answer to the question, 'Who am I?' or 'What is my real, essential self?' is the religious answer; you really are just a soul before God, and all else - your worldly goods and accomplishments, even your physical body and its various pleasures and pains - is insignificant, unimportant." I strongly disagree with this statement. God is more than interested in the "pleasures and pains" of our lives, and for Solomon to think he has the authority to state otherwise is absurd. Hebrews 4:15 says, "For we do not have a high priest [Jesus, God] who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are." If God does not care about our pains; if our sorrow and anguish is "insignificant, unimportant," why, then, did Jesus Christ come to earth and be tempted as we are in order to sympathize with us? He came so that he could be an encouragement to those who are tempted; he came so that we can look to him for comfort, look into his tear filled eyes and listen to him say, "I love you, and we're going to make it, together."  Another example is in chapter eight called "Morality and the Good Life." In the opening questions of the chapter, Solomon brings forth this question, "Many religious commandments, in sexual and food prohibitions, tell us to abstain from the material, or bodily, enjoyments of life. Is it possible to be a religious person and deny yourself none of the pleasures of life? Or if a religion encourages us to make money, buy fancy cars, and live well, is it thereby corrupting its status as a religion?" I strongly disagree with this statement as well! It is rediculous to think that the result of being religious is no pleasure in life!! What about John 10:10 that says, "I came that they [Christians] may have life, and have it abundantly." Doesn't God want us to live a full and pleasureful life? I think so! Of course God does not say for us to "abstain from the material, or bodily, enjoyments of life," but for us to live it abundantly! God does not want us to become greedy and try our whole lives to get money, fancy cars, and the like, but he does want us to live comfortably and live well. He DOES want us to live well! If you are looking into buying this book, for pleasure reading or for teaching a class, I would highly advise you against it, 100%. Find something better and more worthwhile to read, something that states the facts on BOTH sides rather than the opinion of one narrow-minded view 
 The only real crime surrounding this film was the murder of Chandler's story. This is just another example of someone capitalizing on someone else's reputation to sell a film. Gould is about as much Marlowe as Pee Wee Herman is Mike Hammer - i.e., there is no resemblence. Additionally, the cinematography is terrible - it looks like a cheap 70's movie shot in video instead of film. There's absolutely no suspense, nor snappy delivery of lines by Gould. I can only imagine that anyone who liked this movie probably cared more about Marlowe's bare-topped neighbors than anything else, because there's almost nothing of redeeming value in this movie. For those fans of real noir and/or hard-boiled detective pulp, don't waste your money or time watching this junk. You'll be disappointed. 
 The author claims to be a historian, and from everything I've heard, his work on pre-20th century American law is quite good.  Unfortunately, he must not be as conversant with the 20th century as he'd like to think, because there were entire movements that were completely left out of the book.  For example, the dramatic impact of the women's movement on things like the Civil Rights movement was completely ignored.  In addition, he vaccilates too often on the validity of certain types of evidence.  For example, when public opinion is in favor of his viewpoint, then that viewpoint has been rightly elevated to the "Pantheon" of legal thought.  When public opinion is opposed to him, then the U.S. public is nothing more than a mass of ignorant fools.  Furthermore, he makes certain claims in the book which are the type that could be empirically tested.  What's more, they are the type of claim that almost assuredly have been tested at some point, yet there is no support given for those claims.  Overall, a very sloppy piece of work 
 Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.  The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.)   I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.    Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.  
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 This version "Wind and Cloud - The Storm Riders" made in 2004 is not the same as "The Storm Riders" made in 1998.  This dvd is a condensed version of a TV series packaged by Tai Seng. It is full-screen and was made for TV. It is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours.  Most people doing the reviews for this DVD is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Chen 
 I am fresh off of seeing this for the first time. It was so bad, I HAD to warn the rest of you.  The ONLY thing connecting this movie to the first one is Carlito, Drugs, New York and the 70's. There is nothing else since this movie doesn't seem to be connected in any other way to the original. I don't even see how they can get away with calling it a "prequel".   First off, Jay Hernandez doesn't even remotely translate well into the role of Carlito Brigante that Al Pacino populated in the original. You get the idea that he is more likely, playing dress up and pretending to be someone he's not. Which technically is the truth. But come on, who wants to watch a movie and be reminded so often that everyone is just "acting"? We want to feel like everything that's happening is real, and it's right on our own little TV screen.   Secondly, none of the characters from the original show up in this movie. No Lalin, Pachanga (even though Luis Guzman plays a character named Nacho), no Reynaldo, which is who Carlito was connected with before his jailing. Not even Davy Kleinfeld. And  Gail...poor thang is replaced by some Puerto-Rican girl named Leticia.   So all these bizarre 1995 "Shaft" like events happen that leads up to the ending. Carlito is through with the drug business and ends up living in Barbados. Well, how did he come to the wonderful conclusion that he should get BACK into drugs, dump Leticia, move back to the NY and reunite with all the characters that we know and love from the original....plus end up at the place he started at IN THE BEGINNING of the original??????????  Unanswered questions.  This movie is more like a De-quel than a Pre-quel. A DEgrading attempt at recapturing the glory of the original film. 
 The book Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White to me is blatant and apparent proof that the Asian political voice has been hijacked and is fully rampant with an anti-white, anti-American viewpoint.  While I do not think the mind of Mr. Wu is reflective of the vast majority of Asians in America, his scripture is about as proof-positive as I have seen that while white Americans (European Americans) have fought hard against segregation for decades under a naïve spell for the benefit of minorities, Asian politicians as well as university professors of various minority races are actually promoting the philosophy and indoctrination for racial separatism.  The idea of racial equality is apparently not what elites like Frank Wu have in mind:  the condemnation of America and the same people who created pro-Asian immigration laws from the middle 1960s - whites -- is.  Far beyond equal rights for all, this new anti-anything-for-the-sake-of-it viewpoint, which airs in Yellow is nothing like what Martin Luther King, Jr., and the many other former civil rights activists were promoting.  The mindset of the author in this book (Frank Wu) is hyper-eccentric, seemingly hateful, dangerously irrational, and anti-establishment with no clear objective other than dissent for destruction.  To learn about the new form of hatred that a growing radical Asian intellectual base and other minorities are brewing, browse this book 
 We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it.  This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic.  I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours.  A total waste of money 
 I watched Adam & Evil this morning on cable and was extremely disappointed.  When I read the description and the year it was made (2004), I had to set a reminder.  I should have known a harbinger of things to come was when it noted brief nudity.  Not to watch strictly for a bevy of beautiful girls but it is an important element to a horror slasher flick.  The movie starts out promising with a cast of your typical high school sweethearts.  The excitement of celebrating high school graduation at a secluded lake to party and satisy their carnal lust.    It rapidly goes downhill from there.  The movie was styled like Friday the 13th that I kept waiting for Jason Vorhees (or his Mother) to pop out of the woods.  As Jeffrey noted and I totally concur, if you are going to make a horror movie such as this one with the same story line done over a million times, do something original.  You better have a ton of serious and creative splatter, beautiful naked "teens" running from a killer, etc.  This movie had none of it 
 Former Philadelphia newscaster Larry Kane scrapes the bottom of his memories of covering The Beatles and few encounters with Lennon afterward to pad this combination of memoir and hagiography.   Kane covered the Beatle tours as a radio reporter and his book about them, "Ticket to Ride," is considered an excellent fly-on-the-wall account. Here, he takes his material, what little information he's gathered, padded it with bombastic praise for the group and nearly everyone who knew or worked with them then tacked on 33 pages of fan letters. Kane is besotted with Lennon and uncritically takes his side whether John is using his rough tongue on his friends, cheating on his wives or behaving badly while taking copious amounts of drugs and alcohol.  Kane wraps the Beatles in fulsome prose that would embarrass the most hardened egotist. The Shea Stadium concert? "An epic moment in contemporary entertainment" Onetime band mate Stu Sutcliffe? "In the formative years of John's march to eternal greatness, Stu Sutcliffe was a colossal figure." Even Beatle experts aren't spared this trowelwork, with one authority called "the world's greatest scholar" on the group. This fulsome praise makes for hard reading.  Kane's prose settles down when he describes the private moments he shared with Lennon while on tour, and there's a wonderful section describing the weekend Lennon spent in Philadelphia helping Kane's station with its telethon in 1975. The accompanying 40-minute DVD mixes a promotional interview with Kane with a 13-minute interview from 1968 with Lennon and McCartney, and a few seconds of Lennon giving the weather report as part of the telethon promotion. So while there are some interesting bits, it wasn't enough to justify a book. As they say in the record business, I didn't hear a hit 
 .............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together.  The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society.  That cannot be true.  All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh.  I'm still thinking about that theory 
 I assumed any Peterson guide would be good enough to provide a solid field reference.  This was an unpleasant surprise -- it is well short of the mark.  For starters, approximately a sixth of the book was bound upside down.  (I did not have enough time before my trip to return it.)  Next, the number of plates seems particularly limited and, finally, the number of birds covered seems far too limited.  The first two entries I went to while in the field irritatingly simply referenced other Peterson guides with no further detail.  Note to publisher: this diminishes the Peterson brand 
 Although the author uses quite a bit of creative license in his tale of the events of the Mitcham war, the book is still enjoyable to read and gives a definite sense of the time period and location's culture. Having grown up in rural Alabama, I can attest that some of those cultural standards survive today.  I think the characters were realistic, if a bit flat in places. The mystery was based entirely on the timeline of events and the author did a good job of keeping you intrigued in working it all out.  I give this novel only 2 stars because the historical facts are few and far between, and due to the first chapter which cast a sour note over the rest of the novel for me. Animal lovers beware: you should either skip this first chapter, which adds little to the story, or prepare yourself for an overly detailed description of a main character drowning a sackful of puppies 
 In this book, Mr. Biggs does not discuss the fact that before he left Morgan Stanley he was unmasked as having fabricated comments used in his research reports (claimed to be from his plumber, Ron Valentine) [see NYT, May 21, 2000, Sec 3, p2]. Readers and potential readers of Hedgehogging should, however, remember. It explains the view smart investors have had of Mr. Biggs for some time: he is mildly entertaining, but not someone you should use for serious advice. And above all: never give him any money.  Hedgehogging won't challenge this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, it is about what the author does not say. Nowhere does Mr. Biggs actually detail his hedge fund's strategy or process. His discussion of losses from shorting oil are interesting, but only highlight his lack of thought. Is Mr. Biggs just the public face for Traxis, asking for money for no other reason than he has been around a long time?  It is also about what he does say. Several times Mr. Biggs talks about the "special magic" that it takes to be an investment superstar, most memorably when he talks of the "seeing eye" (p111).  This seems to be his core philosophy. Investment success is not made or created, it just happens to those who succeed.   And it is about his actions. In the end, hedge funds can be judged by only one thing: performance. After initial success with Fairfield Partners, Mr. Biggs does not talk about their returns other than that Fairfield "survived the bear market of the 1970s." He left in 1973. We will all see how Traxis does.  Finally, an attempt to put names to pseudonyms. Most do not precisely match Mr. Biggs' "clues," but many of the details may not be true (remember Ron Valentine). Superstar Ian (p11): J. Kevin Kenny, Jr., Emerging Sovereign Group Grinning Gilbert (p15): Steven Cohen, SAC (fantasy amalgamated with Zalmon Gilbert Simmons) Jock Robinson and Casino Resorts (p35): Robert Wilson and Resorts International Jim the Trigger (p51): Janus alums ala Warren Lammert and Blaine Rollins Peter the Great (p63): Henry Kravis, KKR Tim (p96): Nicolas Roditi The Bearded Prophet of the Apocalypse (p99): Douglas Kass, Seabreeze Julian's Guy (p104): Tiger Cub cocktail with likes of Chase Coleman, Thomas Facciola Dave (p133): David Marvin, Marvin & Palmer Greg from Mega (p192): Leon Cooperman, Omega Judson Thomas and his special Wall Street Journal (ch20):  When first written in 1971, the story was clearly fantasy. But today, it is remarkable how Barton has become Judson. "... a big, beefy middle-aged man, faintly disheveled, his shoes spotted. The face was good - strong, sturdy features arranged honestly - but the eyes had been shot away a long time ago and now there was nobody home a lot of the time... Jud knew all the big names in the game like Kingdon, Cooperman, and Druckenmiller, but they disdained him as a hack." 
 Profiles In Courage  By: John F. Kennedy  Intorduced by: Caroline Kennedy   Forworded by: Robert F. Kennedy  	Profiles in Courage I think is about courage in battle along with politics, and J.F.K. helps  us realize that. Profiles in courage is an autobiography written by J.F.K. he talks about some of   his what I thought were inspirations. They were senators in which J.F.K. told their stories. I   wanted to read this memoir because it seemed like an interesting political book. The important   events I thought were when J.F.K. talked about the senators who made a difference and who  didn't take no for an answer.  	I think these events were important to the author because the senators he talks about   seemed a lot like J.F.K. When the author talks about the senators he talks about quotes, policies,   and things that happened while they were in office. At the beginning of every chapter there's a   quote from the senator he'll be talking about. There's one part where J.F.K. talks about the   meaning of courage and talks about courage in battle and courage in the assembly.  	The author also talks about the bad parts of courage, for example when he's talking about   WWII he brings up the fact we lost more than 300,000 troops and 300,000,000,000 in expenses.  I think the title profiles in courage means, that when you look at courage you see all these   different profiles of people who exhibited great courage like Audie Murphy or Rosa Parks.  	    	I think J.F.K. had a lot of courage because of his brother talks about J.F.K.'s days on a   PT Boat during WWII when it's attacked by the Japanese J.F.K. goes in the line of fire to save a   severely burned comrad. J.F.K. showed courage in politics and war. When J.F.K. pretty much   stopped WWIII from happening with Russia or when he saved his boat crew member. J.F.K. had   a very good political set up. When he refused to give the order for air support in the Bay Of Pigs   operation a lot of people might have died in the army but it prevented a nuclear war.  	I don't think J.F.K. could've learned anything about himself, but that's just what I think.   He might have been inspired by some of the political actions his "idols" did. I didn't really like   this book becuase i didn't get some of the politics. I wouldn't reccomend this book to people   who don't like politics or don't like books that aren't actiony. I didnt't like this book one bit   even though it's about one of my favorite political heroes.  
 If you want to spend 4 times as much money, 8 times as much time, and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately "politely refuse"--THEN BUY THIS BOOK! The author clearly has NO CLUE that "less is often more. 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 About ten years ago, I tried to read this trash-book.This book is so absurd as UFO fables or eugenicists books and such as these things. The core's source of this bad book are the lies told by an italian called Virgilo Scattolini, about sixty years ago.This italian was payed US$500 , each month between 1939 and 1947, by Uncle Sam government.At that times, US$500 were similar to US$15,000 today.Even with so many money, Virgilo Scattolini was nothing more than a crook and buffoon.After many years loosing money, with a buffoon, USA's government decided to dismiss Scattolini.This same buffoon, Virgilo Scattolini, looking as ever, for money, selled the same lies to italians communist who published the same lies.They became a best-seller until USA's government recognized that Scattolini, was nothing more than a buffoon.USA's only recognized that Scattolini was a buffoon, when he became to lie about the USA's ambassador. This book is so bad and absurd, that I advise you that this is an useless book. Were the gods astronauts?Was any Pope a nazist or eugenicist? NO and NO!    
 what is up with the quality of image on this dvd, it looks like a cheap VHS image,  whats the point of DVD???    Moto gp needs to take a page from NFL films  and properly document their history, after all it's only 16 races or so.  I could understand in the case of hockey or baseball with 1000+ games to cover.  the worlds most exciting sport deserves better 
 I may be the only one dissenting on this tome, but I found this book to be not only boringly repetitive (as other reviewers did) and primary-school-basic (as others did), but also quite confusing. By using an endless variety of examples unrelated to photography in attempts to illustrate his points, he takes readers on useless and distracting excursions and manages to fill almost 300 pages to treat a subject which is perfectly treatable in 25-30 pages. Read Ansel Adams "The Negative" and other authors instead, or just consult your own camera or meter manual. You'll learn more in a shorter time than with Mr. Farzad's rambling and dull book 
 I have long been fascinated with the Spanish Civil War and bought this DVD with high expectations.  What a disappointment!  Rather than a history of the Spanish Civil War, it is mostly a look at Brits who served in the International Brigades, based around the memories of a few elderly members.  The overview of the war is weak with no coverage of the events that led up to the Spanish Civil War, little coverage of the political events during the war, virtually no coverage of daily life in the Nationalist and Republican zones, etc.  The focus is firmly on the battles fought by the International Brigades, but little attempt is made to place these engagements in the context of the war and the descriptions of the battles are weak.  Anyone not already familiar with the war would have been perplexed by this presentation.  As stated earlier in this review, the focus is on the Brits.  No coverage is given to so many of the interesting facets of this war.  The Requetes are not mentioned.  Neither is the Anarchist leader Durruti.  Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and the Phalange are absent.  Franco is reduced to a figure in old newsreels and no background is given to him.  The only Republican leader to receive much treatment is La Passionaria, and this is largely in the context of memories of her by the Brits of the International Brigades.  As one might expect from the focus on the International Brigades, the tone of the presentation is overwhelmingly left-wing.  A British historian is shown sporadically, and he does his best to present accurate information on the war, but the narration and the rest of the presentation largely reduces this complex struggle to a leftist fable of good Republicans against evil Fascists.  From the credits I believe the film was actually produced in 1995.  If that fact had been mentioned, and if it had been emphasized that the DVD was mostly about the reminiscences of British members of the International Brigade, I would have awarded it two stars.  I think it would still be a poor piece of work, but I would have known what I was getting.  I give it one star because it was marketed as a history of the Spanish Civil War, and it is not.  
 Tedeschi's voice has matured and become more expressive over the years, but she should either finally, belatedly, get some lead chops together or abandon her ego and hire on a player that matches the obviously prodigious abilities of the band backing her up. 
 Bill Murray plays Bill Murray.  He has the same dead-pan, expressionless delivery he often has. He manifests the same childish humor here as in Saturday Night Live.  So what if he sits on top of a snow topped mountain? There is no dialog that can demonstrate he did more than sleep there.  There is not an ounce of real Buddhism here.  And when the Buddhist monk says, "The path to salvation is narrow and difficult, like walking the razor's edge," I say "What salvation?"  Buddhism is not about salvation, it is about escaping sorrow by renunciation and following the 8 fold path.  I question the taste and knowledge of the reviewers who gave this show 5 stars.  I got this movie because of the rave reviews here and felt betrayed 
 When I was a little kid, I'd see this book on the shelves at the library and in used bookstores and wonder what masterful tale was contained inside, and yet somehow I never managed to pick it up. 20 years later I finally splurged and got it for a dollar at the library book sale, and read the whole thing cover to cover on a transpacific flight.  Oh, man! What I had been missing! Some of the worst dialogue ever committed to paper, the most appalling junk science since "The Core," and gratuitous sex scenes that made me actually laugh out loud. Dirk Pitt is like Doc Savage -- only twenty times smarter and stronger! The fact that this one reached the NY Times bestseller list makes you question the fate of humanity.  Good for a laugh or two, especially with some of the utterly ludicrous scenes near the end (don't forget that sultry strip-tease, seemingly written by a ten-year-old), but probably not worth it in the long run unless you're a fast reader 
 AFTER RETURNING THE FIRST UNIT I TRIED TO GET THE REPLACENT UNIT TO WORK  EVEN TOOK IT TO A COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP TO SEE IF I WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG THIS COST ME 40 DOLLARS.

 If you read what Peter Stanford writes in newspapers, you'll quickly learn that he's deeply ideologically committed to a range of agendas that happen to be at odds with the teaching of the Catholic Church, one of his favorite subjects. The Church's apparent unresponsiveness to Mr. Stanford's shrill demands that it change its ancient teachings, practices, etc., to suit his tastes is apparently intolerable to Stanford, who as another reader pointed out, is certainly no scholar or historian, but an amateur. You'll find better reading elsewhere. This is a load of junk - unprofessional, unscholarly, and unreadable 
 Martin Amis has found the ideal forum to compliment his writing in Tina Browns latest attempt to prove that she has all the literary acumen of a Beverly Hills hair dresser, Talk magazine. Lets just hope for the sake of  good writing that Suicide runs in Mr. Amis's family 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 A waste of time and money. Most of the stories are corny, self-conscious, and dull. Quite a few are so poorly written that they are just an adjective or two away from being inadvertently funny. Imagine (if you can) reading an erotic story in "Reader's Digest" or "Good Housekeeping." You can see it here first.    
 I found this book to only be okay and boring it needs zaz not blaa..That is what it is blaa. I would pass it on or give it to a in-law then to keep it.It has good reciepes but no more then the other ones and it is a basic book. I think ,if this is to have a bang it needs more then what it has. 
 Wallis Budges' Book, "The Gods of The Egyptians" was Interesting at BEST and full of insulting and incorrect terminology and opinions about the Ancient Egyptians at WORST!!  The book delved into the belief structure of the religion of the Egyptians but he referred to the Egyptians as "savages" many times then made statements that "...their ideas about the world beyond the grave and God and gods were of a savage, childish and inconsistent character". He also made the statement that "..it is difficult to see how  the eminent Egyptologist could attempt to compare the conceptions of God formed by a half-civilized African people with those of such cultured nations as the Greeks and Romans".  ANY educated man that has studied Egypt knows that the Egyptians TAUGHT the Greeks everything they THOUGHT they knew who came into Egypt ignorant and obsessed with homosexuality I.E.- Socrates, Pythagora credited w/(Pythagorems Theorom) which he learned in Egypt and the Romans were the same way. The Romans INVADED Egypt.. raping the country of her knowledge and culture.. which is how the Romans got THEIR knowledge I.E.- The Library of Alexandria. It is well known that Egypt was considered the "Learning Center Of The World" and had even developed the FIRST writing systems and were mathematical, medicinal and philosophical  geniuses.   YET... Wallis Budge would have his readers believe that they were SAVAGES and their religion wasn't really even worth bothering with..  yet he neglects to mention that it is the SAME religion upon which Christianity was based. So I would say to read Mr. Budges books (but especially this one), with a reserved and cautious mind. I have quite a few of his books, and they all maintain that same opinionated and incorrect view of the Egyptians and their culture. Therefore if you take his writings literally and as pure fact..  you might miss the GREATNESS that existed in an ancient people and their culture 
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 Adds volume but overall I would say the sound quality is very similar or not as good without this device. I use it with my Olympus WS-300m. Maybe it would work better with a Sony. It is also more prone to have interferance and it will make a loud noise when it picks up on something. I don't use it just in case it makes that noise I don't want it to ruin my recording. 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
  When Wanda brought this thing home and threw it at me, I thought it might be that copy of American Squirrel Hunter magazine I asked her to pick up.   I got up to chapter 8 before I realized it ain't got nothing to do with varmint hunting at all.  Not for me 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 this movie is a great waste of time. with its annoying litle rich brat kids and one of them kills their new best friend and Diggs incestigates with the worst soutern accent in the world, plus he shouldnt of been in this whole mess. with a bitchy cast and a nowhere story, this'll please those people with less than zero brain 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to "believe". The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. Why the story is so weak? First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite.  Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie.    
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 I'm giving this book a generous rating of 2 stars because I did read it at one sitting.  But I read it at one sitting because I saw a lot of potential to discuss the issues at hand - the examination of your motivations, relationships, wasted opportunities, etc. when you're coming to the end of life's road.  But the discussion was trivial and ultimately didn't work because Ms. Dean gave us characters who, after 304 pages, I didn't really know or care about 
 I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance 
 such as painting a room, or cleaning the kitchen, these books are entertaining as audio books.  At the risk of sounding "snobbish" (which I am not) they are a cross between "Murder She Wrote" and Mr. Ed.  
 When you find yourself double-checking the bookjacket to see if the author you have enjoyed in the past could really have written this, it is not a good sign.  I can't even get into the book. I have read Catherine Coulter before, and while she isn't my favorite romance novelist, I have had only enjoyable experiences thus far.  That ended when I picked up this book from the library.   The dialogue is awful. There is no flow, they just randomly say things out of their mouths. There is no context for it either, no reason given for anything they say. And since what they say is so unbelievably corny, trite, or odd, you really need some kind of frame to put it in for it to have any meaning. I gather from the reviews that this contains characters from her other books, so maybe the context is there.  The whole conversation about discipline in the beginning pages also has no context. I found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline. Did it mean what I think it meant? Or something else? It wasn't super clear.  The man's character gives you nothing to work with. He's a womanizer and yet, he spills out a story about avenging his housemaid's demise.  Then he immediately blurts out "Why did I say that?" Why indeed? When he is questioning it, I know I'm in trouble.    And what is up with the whole "big girl" repetition? First, a big girl in my mind is someone with larger proportions--not necessarily someone tall. The "big girl" is gorgeous, but we have no idea why because the descriptions he pants about her don't describe anything. Just picture a goddess. There ya go. Got it?  Good.    Unfortunately I'm not going to make it to the whole "point" of this book, something about a treasure. I cannot, simply cannot get past these pages.  
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 I liked very much Trout and Ries, Positioning and Marketing Warfare. Reading this book, I had an impression that most of the professional knowledge the author has, was distilled in his previous books.  Mr Trout is doing something he said was not a good practice in Advertising (see Positioning): Line Extension. The good parts of this book you will find in his previous books, maybe with different phrases and examples.   The other thing that is hurting is that he is trying to give advice in areas where he has limited knowledge and experience.   Looking at some titles of the chapters in this book you will find:  Chapter 4 - Quality and Customer Orientation are rarely differentiating Ideas.  Toyota and Honda achieved a position in the mind of customers worldwide that they make high quality products for a good price. Well, it will be difficult for the other automakers, who are actually working to catch up in quality, to differentiate themselves on quality, for they are also runs. I would say that is a hell of a strategy, maybe is not for everyone, but them differentiation is by definition for a few, and not for everybody.  How many companies have positioned themselves as high quality products? Does it pay? Go ask Nikon, Zeiss, Leica, Volvo, Patek Philippe...  Chapter 5 has as title: "Creativity is not a differentiating Idea"  I guess I cannot believe that Mr. Trout has read his own phrase. Does he mean that lack of creativity is a differentiating Idea? Does not make sense. I think quite the opposite, when you are not able to create something unique, is when you go out trying to do something else to differentiate yourself.    I have seen creativity applied to Advertising, the results were fantastic. In Brazil, sometime ago, Brastemp, (a Home Appliances company with financial links with Whirlpool) run an ad campaign that stressed the Quality of Brastemp products using the phrase: " it is not a Brastemp !". Each ad told a story about something (not related to appliances) and the concluding remarks would be " it is not a Brastemp !". The phrase got so popular, that became incorporated as an expression of our language. The end result was that Brastemp established itself in the market so strongly that still today people in Brazil position Brastemp as the top quality producer of home appliances. In the mind of the Brazilian consumer Brastemp is top quality, better than GE, Electrolux, ex-Westinghouse, etc...  I have seen creativity applied to Product Design with similar results.   This book should be read with a critical eye, for it has some impressive phrases but when you think a second time and compare with some practical experience you find problems.   I am not an advertising professional, I just enjoy reading books that come with good new ideas.     
 This book is a brutal read. It is so dry and dull; I only purchased it because of my Anthropology course required it. I never truly read past the 3rd chapter; after then, I just began skimming and trying to salvage my grade. The book is plagued with too many descriptions and adjectives, the book really never gets anywhere, nor does it pick up speed and get interesting. The book is written by an anthropology student who traveled to Puerto Rico to document its people and culture. This is seriously like reading a term paper. If you want to learn about Puerto Rican life.... I don't know what to tell you, maybe try to catch something on TV.   - "Taso

 i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag 
 I was looking for information on penguins at a second grade reading level. This book was TOO easy and didn't give me details. It ws too simple and general 
 This book is a huge disappointment.  Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance.  At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.  You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people. 
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions. I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail. Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion. Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species. I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.  No, I don't "dig" it, Dean 
 This is a fragment of a book.  While it is well written, has good characters and some very interesting concepts, it fails for lack of a plot.  The story seems to stop right when it should just be getting interesting.  This is a pity since everything else was in place to make it a truly good book.  I was very frustrated and disappointed.     
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 I was saddened after reading this collection of articles.  These authors display some of the most dreadful examples of eisegesis I have ever seen.  Throughtout history people of all stripes have attempted to use Scripture to justify their view or cause and this is yet another example.  An honest objective study of history, Biblical languages, along with a simple reading of the words of Scripture prove this book to be nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of another group who earnestly seeks legitimacy from Christianity 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 I picked us this book because I heard that Senator Kerrey was a presidential hopeful for the Democrats. Turns out that is Senator John Kerry from Mass, not Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. Regardless of the political future of the author, this book was a disappointment. Senator Kerry tells two stories, the first of his uncle who was killed in WWII. Second, his own story of growing up in Nebraska, joining the service, going to Viet Nam, being wounded and recovering. However, there is no analysis of the events past the obvious "Viet Nam was a mistake" and we were not fighting to win. He also stops and at the point where he gets out of the VA hospital and does not tell us how he went on to become a US Senator. I would not recommend this book 
 All of these negative reviews should tell you something!  I wish I had bought this at Amazon, so I could've seen these reviews first.  They are all correct.  There is NO 3D effect at all.  In fact, wearing the glasses is a viewing obstruction.  We could see the pictures better without them.  Also, I don't know if it was my imagination or my frustration, but it seemed that wearing the glasses actually gave me a headache!  This would be a much better product if they didn't bother to try to make the images 3D.  I too have been looking for slides that will fit into this projector.  It wouldn't be bad with plain 2D images 
 These creatures were spirits endowed with reason and will. Those who received them into themselves immediately became possessed and mad. But never, never had people considered themselves so intelligent and unshakeable in the truth as did these infected ones. Never had they thought their judgments, their scientific conclusions, their moral convictions and beliefs more unshakeable 
 I'll bet industry insiders really do love this book. It drastically overstates the number of manufactured homes being sold (as a percentage of all home sales), it drastically overstates their savings as opposed to site-built homes, brags about "strict" HUD requirements (which are anything but), etc. There is one factual error after another with nothing to back up the claims. Although Talylor stresses how much "research" went into this brief fluff piece, he doesn't site anyone or any study that I recall seeing. The worst part of the lies to me are his claims that "the vast majority of home sales professionals are well-intentioned and eager to give you sincere advice and service . . . Some of the finest individuals I've known make their living in the manufactured housing business." Well, that certainly conflicts with my experience when I went shopping at dozens of lots in two states, and it seems to be at odds with Consumer's Union finding that half of all consumer complaints involve fraud on the part of these "fine" individuals. I don't know where Mr. Taylor worked (he was an industry employee), but maybe it was on a different planet. The typical earthly dealership incarnation bears little resemblence to what Manufactured Homes: The Buyer's Guide describes. Specifically, Consumer's Union found several kinds of fraud prevalent (in the article "In Over Our Heads" / February 2002): * the dealership substituted a different home (another model, year, or size) for the one the customer thought they were buying * the dealership falsified information on the loan application (often lying about the down payment amount or accepting borrowed money as a down payment) * the dealership ended up charging more for the home than the price they originally quoted * the terms of the sale were changed on the customer midway through the deal (when momentum makes it hard to back out) and additional expenses were added like extra fees or higher interest rates * the dealership refused to give the customer copies of contracts they had to sign  Wow, these guys do sound like the salt of the earth, don't they? In my on family's case, we were on multiple occasions asked to sign blank forms for our "conveinence." After the contract was official, and when we complained about things that weren't right, people from the dealership actually cussed us out!  Another extremely important point is the home's set-up. Even the best manufactured home can be destroyed by a faulty set-up, and it won't be covered by warranty. I think Taylor devotes 1 or 2 inconsequential pages to this very important topic. Wes Johnson devotes 25 pages to the set-up in his book on manufactured homes (The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook), and 7 more just on the foundation itself. In fact, Johnson's book is the only one I've read that actually tells it like it is. If you're considering buying a manufactured home, or even if you've already bought one, you should buy The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook (ISBN 0-7864-2209-2). While Taylor, Burnside, and Grissim are sugar-coating the industry and basically getting their facts wrong over and over, Johnson's narrative rings true to experience. He tells you how you can get a good manufactured home and save a ton of money without getting ripped off like so many others have 
 Ted Rall is a cartoonist and in way's we can say that he lives in a cartoon world. He very much wants to believe in the greatness of socialism, he wants to believe that everything good in this world has arrived from socialists and that everything bad comes from conservatives. Living a life like this is hard and causes one to make gross fabrications. To Mr. Rall superman, spider-man and wonder-women exist. But to us, slightly more well adjusted persons, we view these characters as fictionalized cartoons. Unfortunately Mr. Rall's book is that of cartoon-land so filled with these fabrications, that it really becomes a work of fiction.   It goes without saying that from the-1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. In essence we do have a one party system, Socialist party A or Socialist Party B. But there are still some differences.   Rall doesn't quite understand that in our current situation, in which Democrats, whose domestic policy are carefully tailored to benefit a narrow socioeconomic segment of wealthy individuals, unions, lawyers and fringe special interest groups has become unpalatable to the average middle class American. Across the country, from California to New York, the hard leftist democratic candidates were unable to motivate their own base, let alone attract the center voters required to win close races. What Rall doesn't seem to get is that the Middle American doesn't view the Democrats as targeting the Republicans as opponents, instead the Democrats target America and the way of life that Middle America lives.  For example, Teddy has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts "that favor the rich" Unfortunately this hard-left mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!   It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.   Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.   If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.   Ted and his ilk are so out of touch with the average Middle American that this doesn't make sense to him. They don't understand that people don't like being lied to. The biggest problem is that Ted believes that you can say whatever you want, this doesn't work anymore. With today's access to information you can show a lie so quickly it just doesn't make sense to say one.   For example, Ted lies about 2000 election on just about every count. First of all the state was called for gore 70 minutes before the polls closed in Florida. (Sorry Ted your lie that it was 10 minutes is patently false.) This early and fraudulent call was a concentrated effort by the liberal media to help disenfranchise the states voters. Democratic (yes, democratic) pollsters put the number of disenfranchised voters at between 10,000 - 15,000 that decided not to vote in the panhandle region. This, btw, is predominantly republican country.    But what is even more appalling is that the exit polling by all major news outlets was showing that Bush was winning. The extent to what liberals will do to swing the vote unethically in their favor is atrocious.  Gore's slide into win at any cost came quickly with his lawyers filling a petition to stop the counting of oversees military ballots. These ballots, btw, were never counted and added to the official total. Since most of them would have voted Bush and by counting the disenfranchised voters Bush easily won the state.   Now remember, the only reason the Supreme Court got involved was because the socialist state judges refused the follow the law. Gore only wanted the most liberal of all counties to be counted, but the state rules said all the counties had to be recounted. The first Supreme Court decision was 9-0 the second was 7-2, both of these decisions said in effect that the whole state had to be recounted. Ted's argument that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction is merit-less, the presidential election is FEDERAL not a state election.  In the end the state recounted the ballots 4 different times and in all 4 Bush one.   Then a bunch of hard left media outlets got together at a cost of nearly $1 million bucks to try to PROVE that Gore won (NORC).  Cartoon-boy tells us that "Media Consortium Statewide Count of `Undervotes' and `Overvotes' Proves Gore Won Under Any Standard." (PAGE #)  This statement is blatantly, undeniable False, a big fat Lie and you can download the NORC document yourself. The NORC reports that they recounted all of the votes using 9 different methodologies. Bush won eight out of the nine and he won by a larger margin than was officially certified.  Sorry Cartoon-Boy your lies are great for the socialistic automata; for me I prefer to remain in the middle and support the truth. 
 There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs.  Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music.  But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks.  However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer.  These two styles do not work well together.  Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album.  It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music.  At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. President."  The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer.  Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.  Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb. 
 I picked up an issue of this magazine last week because I wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser. After I got it home, I opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine I have ever seen. The articles read like something from "Teen Beat", yet it's filled with adult material. There were about 10 articles on "how to please your man" and "what guys like" and even a "sex workout". These articles didn't contain any "real" advice--just unintelligent babble. For instance, did any of you know that guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex? HMMM, crazy.   Anyway, I don't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating, and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read.   But if you're still into taking quizzes and looking at "half-naked hunks" who have barely hit puberty, then this magazine is perfect. I would have given this magazine 0 stars, but unfortunately it's not an option 
 Sure this book appears to appeal to the "spiritual" and good in all of us but it is a lie. Vassula's book is so riddled with inconsistencies and ideas that contradict with Catholic teaching that it is in your best interest to put the book in the recycle bin where it belongs. Plus the Vatican has stated that her messages are of human origin and not divine. Beware of Vassula!!! 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 I have a university maths degree and found the book very obvious and drawn out for the first few chapters. In spite of this I looked forward to what was going to be explained later. Suddenly from a very simple and easy to understand explanation on the EMH he starts to use mathematics in his equations that I had a lot of difficulty following. There was very little or no explanation of how these equations were arrived at and a lot of mathematics and statisics is assumed. This book does not apply the theory in ny meaningful way to the markets let alone the capital markets in my opinion. I found that I took very little away from this book and would not recommend it to anyone who has basic mathematics like myself or is looking for some deeper insight into the markets. I would hate to have Mr Peters as a teacher based on his book 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 Whoa you had better not be a Christian reaching out for this book with anys eriousness.  It is New Age so far as I can see.  Some sort of blurry weirdness between oddly invented new Age Christianity and get rich fundamentalist preachers having you mutter over and over, "Money is in my pocket Oh Lord!"  Yeah, yeah, you probably landed here from the "etiquette" training given by Gloria.  This book is mentioned out there in that ole 29 dollar ebook.  Fine, you too no longer hold your fork in the right hand, but frankly this book lacks "poise."  I am too above muttering, "Money in my pocket Oh Lord."  And I don't want to meet anyone with a "wheel" and money mantras.  I prefer that they get out of my face 
 I was in great anticipation to get my hands on this book and get some self help insite into better ways to deal with my sensitivety.  Unfortunately this book tries to target both the clinical psycologist as well as the layperson as its readers and it just doesn't work.  I had to stop reading it after 50 pages. Too many HSP's, HSS's, non HSP's and non HSS's and every combination there of 
 This one didn't do anything for me. It may be allegory, fable, myth, whatever (and yes, readers may recognize these elements and still think the book is a big snooze), but good allegories, fables, and myths also have conflict and drama. This doesn't.  The story marches from the hero's childhood, through his early career years and successes as a young entrepreneur, to his "final downfall" as it says on the dust jacket. But this march follows a perfectly straight path.  Martin is restless at his job; he moves to a better job. Martin is bored with his new job; he opens his new business.  Martin is unsatisfied with his business, he expands it.  He moves on to bigger and bigger enterprises until he moves on to one that is too big.  Yes, hubris is his eventual downfall, but nothing trips him up on the way.  He never faces any substantive opposition and never has a set back, until the very end.   What's missing is conflict (a key element of any drama) and character development.  The characters, pretty flat to begin with, are all the same at the end of the book as they are at the beginning.  Other reviewers compare the novel favorably to Greek tragedies, but the characters in those classic tales had complex relationships, nothing but conflict, and learned lessons along the way.  Here, many characters drift in and then fade away without any further mention of them.  Martin's parents, for example, never make an appearance in his adult life.  His mother-in-law, who is a major character through the middle part of the book, disappears after he marries her daughter, who literally sleeps through their marriage.  Not only do the characters not grow as individuals, every relationship Martin has with another character is static.  "Magic realism" aside, there is nothing to this other than some marginally interesting descriptions of New York City at the turn of the Twentieth Century, and the detailed descriptions of the ever more elaborate attractions of Martin's hotels.   If it's myth and fable you're after, re-read Antigone. 
 The movie could have been so much more with less caracter's. Liv Tyler is very good. Rachel Weisz is only in the movie for short stints but, memberable ones. The soundtract is better than the film. 
 This is one of the worst books I've read. What a waste of money... The basic syntax issues are glossed over. Type polymorphism example is introduced with an error. I can go on and on -with statement, type statement etc .  Author does nothing to guide the reader through a maze of jumbled syntax. Terrible waste of a really good idea. 
 In 2001 during the (good ridance)time of your life craze they released a Cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life. 
 I am a Lee Child fan and have read all his preceding novels to Echo Burning.  This book never gets off the ground until the last 100 pages.  What a huge disappointment.  Skip this one.  
 Storyline very contrived as Kim and Bruce profess their love for each other on a rather slick squeaky sofa/chair after one long extended blind date.  It just didn't make sense, you really have to suspend belief that their relationship barely a week old and bereft with alcoholic stupors could be genuine.  Rent it if you want, Larroquette is funny as the obsessive crazed ex-boyfriend and Bruce has fun with this as his first screen outing and Bassinger plays drunk fairly well.  But unless you can find it in a bargain bin, it's not worth buying   
 I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the "secret" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better. 
 Dick Couch is a former SEAL. He loves the SEALs. This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs. If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start. This book is very informative. If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages. The author really loves the SEALs. Did I mention that? On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times. Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon. This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill. This isn't an old TV western. That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book. Fiction? Non-fiction 
 The Title of this book is "C++ All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies". However after reading this book it is quite obviously aimed at users of Microsoft products on Microsft systems. C++ is a multi-system language and any book calling itself a "C++ All-in-One Desk Reference" should be demonstrating the language in a pure form, such as the excellent "C All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies" book by Dan Gookin. This book either needs to be rewritten to accurately reflect the title or the title needs to be changed to accurately reflect the content, maybe "C++ on Microsoft All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies". If you need to learn C++ in a pure form then find another title 
 This book was EXTREMELY boring.  I only read it because it was assigned reading. It is kind of like a "Chicken Soup for the Soul" but with 3 pages of physology inbetween each story 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 Instead of buying this book you can do the following:   1. Open up Adobe Acrobat on your computer  2. Choose Help from the menu_bar at the top of the screen  3. Select 'Complete Acrobat 7.0 Help...'  4. Look up what you need to know---as this book is no more useful than the Adobe Help Screen   Now wasn't that much easier, more informative, and a lot cheaper? Notice that, unlike most 5 star reviewers, I do not work for a publisher.  If you actually want to learn something instead of wasting your time and money with this garbage, look into "Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Acrobat 5 in 24 hours" by Christopher Smith & Sally Cox (ISBN: 0672323141).  I don't know if these authors (as a team) have any updated versions available but you'll learn more from reading Smith/Cox's version 5 book than Sahlin's version 7 book.  Also try "Adobe Acrobat 7 PDF Bible" by Ted Pandora.  Before you take the three five-star-reviewers seriously notice that they are solely five-star-reviewers. Naturally I am very skeptical of their 5-star review of this or any other book. Select their "See all my reviews" buttons to see what I mean. 
 Whether it's the 'Left Behind' series, (such a charming title), or 'Countdown to Doomsday' or any of the other blood and thunder books, you can count on one thing: God is mad as hell at all of us, (except the 'chosen') and is going to unleash a fury against his archenemy Satan.  The great cosmic battle will be played out at Armeggedon where Satan and God will will duke it out in front of the whole world.  Well, most of the world.  The elect will be taken by rapture into Heaven safely ensconced away from the raging, bloody battle.    Eventually, most of the world will be tossed into a flaming, eternal pit of torture for an eternity, while the saved get to look down on the agony of the unsaved and stick their tongues out: nyah-nyah! I just wonder if when Hagee sees Christ he will yell JJJJEEEEEEZSZZZZUUUUUUUSSS like he does on television.  And all this mind you, in the name of the Prince of Peace 
 There is no bibliography in this book; it is an opinion of a couple married for 20 something years and their experience. If I want someones experience, Ill ask them .It seems anyone can publish a book. I would never recommend this. My therapist even panned it. One star is an over rating. It wasn't helpful advice at all 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!! 
 I ordered the Chocolate & Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a "Best When Used By" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!  I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com 
 Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           "Charlotte Temple" was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now "Charlotte Temple" has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition.          Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's "Evelina" or "Camilla," Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting "dishonorable" against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall.  Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it.           Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte "elopement."          Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading 
 I am a beginner and I was looking for some supplementary instruction to my classwork. This book was unable to give me much help unless I wanted to paint a picture just as the author paints. There was little color mixing or actual technique explained here, and not much on basic brush usage. Perhaps this was meant for a more experienced painter. It has little to offer us beginners 
 Space Cowboys is a case of an average movie that has extra-ordinary actors.  In part I feel that while these actors preformed well that their talent was wasted on the storyline... retired Astronauts reunited one last time for one last mission.  I'm glad I saw it on video and did not pay full-price to see it.   ~FallenMoo 
 This is a horrible book with lots of un-popular terminologies and using abbreviated words, I believe that we can live with "it is likely to" instead of "it is prone that". Furthermore, lack of descriptive volcabulary, eg, "inevitably" had been used more than 10 times in just one single chapter, and countlessly in total 
 I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it.  I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of).  I ended up purchasing some online.  By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working.  We have replaced the batteries several times.  On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare.  We are very disappointed with this unit.  I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!  
 The Light of Other Days, ostensibly co-authored by Arthur C. Clarke, is marketed as a philosophically intriguing tale of the transformation of Earth society in the not-so-distant-future, upon the advent of a remote viewing technology that removes all pretense of privacy from people's lives, and even allows observing events in the past. This is an enticing premise, but it's all downhill from page 1. In fact, the premise is all that's left after you discard the juvenile writing style, the paper-thin plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the Discover magazine-grade science.  I actually gave up on it halfway through, after enduring chapter after chapter of egregious exposition. Relentless, finger-wagging infodumps in dialogue and newscasts read like the following (paraphrased, but not the least bit exaggerated): "'As you know, David, the warning signs of global warming went unheeded way back in the early 2000s, and now there's a permanent El Niño.' 'Why yes, Kate, not only is England, which had to become the 52nd U.S. state after international trade collapsed, locked in ice, but more than 60% of the earth's land is no longer farmable.'" The most blatant morality plays in Star Trek aren't even this bad. These passages are also buffered by a superfluous sex scene that tries to appeal to women, but was clearly written by a man.  And then there's this gem of dialogue, at which point the book cannot be taken any less seriously: "It's like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the Internet. You remember that? ... No, you're too young. The Global Information Infrastructure--the thing that was supposed to replace the Berne copyright convention--collapsed back in the nought-noughts. Suddenly the Internet was awash with unedited garbage. Every damn publishing house was forced out of business, and all the authors went back to being computer programmers, all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust."  Yeah, 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama this is not; it's nowhere near the quality of Clarke's own masterworks, or any others in the genre, for that matter. That said, though, had this been marketed as a teen/preteen volume, I think it would be tolerable. However, I expected far more sophistication from an adult work, especially one with Clarke's name on it. Save your cash and wait for the TV movie 
 Probably this book went way over my head.   The one insight I think I got from it was that during the tech boom, many of the new products were appearing, not because of some fundamental increase in the rate of innovation brought on by the Web, but because of all the money pouring into startups because investors believed the Web would lead to such innovations for technological reasons. A phenomena Soros calls "reflexivity", I guess. But even without knowing that it seemed clear a boom was in progress that would eventually bust. But how to know when? It doesn't seem this book or Soros could tell you.  I hear Soros became a billionaire through his investments and that seemed well beyond a chance event, but I didn't understand  anything in this book to explain how that happened. Speculations about global politics and finance, then a big dash of intuition, and then at times a gain, at times a loss. I don't follow in Soros's case why his gains exceeded his losses. There are others who don't believe in unbiased marketes, why didn't they similarly profit to such an extent. And just knowing that markets are biased, how does it tell you how to time? Perhaps Soros benefitted from adjusting his market positions quickly if his assumptions weren't confirmed by the market: would that help and to such an extent?  It's not clear to me that Soros' explanations in this book are closely related, if at all, to his successes. It may be helpful to be exposed to his mindset, if this book does that, but, after  finishing it, it isn't clear how to apply what I've read. I won't not recommend this book, because I may very well be missing a lot of what it says. Other people's books may not make you a billionaire. But I haven't figured out whether this one will make me one or even allow me to pay for a new car. "The Alchemy of Finance" seems to be about bold gambling I wouldn't want to do with any money I may someday need.      
 The loneliness, sparkling wit and beautiful simplicity of the original Purple Crayon books (and the quite loyally adapted Gene Deitch animated cartoons - still available from Scholastic) are not to be found here, sacrificed to the treacly situations and inexplicable pastel colors of this confused, frustrating - and to this viewer at least - insulting "interpretation." It's as if Harold were aesthetically reincarnated as one of those hard sugar figurines manufactured for quick decoration of grocery store birthday cakes. I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is "the way things are" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's "Harold." 
 I recieved this itema s a gift. I thought it would be great I was wrong! The designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful!!!!!!!! 
 Books of political position ought be fact ridden.  They should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts.  Only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions.  Mr. Horowitz does none.  Instead he starves us for facts.  He substitutes instead only editorial cant.  I can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one.  The audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting.    For example, he contrasts, on the first page the Iraq war as "so successful in its results.",  with the Vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war.  Mr. Horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  He states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of American power is a bulwark of national security.  He insists that American Presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists.  I kept waiting for evidence of any kind.  He even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than Pearl Harbor.  My guess is that WW II was not so cheap or unworthy.  Neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the World Trade Center; at least I can reference Time magazine as the source.  Mr Horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of Democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the Neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of American soldiers and guards.    Mr. Horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort.  Many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources.  He quotes the New York Review of Books, but leaves out words he does not like.  Oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the Bush administration "on the run".  He probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general.  I cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical 
 Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of "A Million Little Pieces" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it!  I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little "Book Club" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone.  At least she finished it; disappointed!  Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace.  I felt I was constantly on siesta!  From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless 
 I am vegan and bought this for a friend who is from the south and thought she'd get a kick out of trying some dairy free/meat free southern recipes considering the rave reviews it got.  I don't understand how this cookbook can claim to be dairy free when many of the recipes call for buttermilk, cheese, butter, and condensed milk.  For example, the cheesebread recipe calls for swiss cheese and cheddar cheese. Huh?  I am disappointed but more confused than anything 
 I have had nothing but problems with this book.  The practice problems in the chapter do not reflect the ones at the end of the chapter, which pretty much leaves it up to you to figure out what is going on.  The chapters are not well written in the first place!  Very hard to follow!  There is no supplemental solution manual to follow along with so you can see how the practice problems were solved.  I could go on and on.  In general, possibly the worst chemistry text I have ever had to use 
 I setup the filter yesterday, it was very very loud, trust me, you can't sleep that with in your bedroom. The Filter also doesn't not well with a 29 gallons saltwater tank. 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 After hearing and reading a number of astonishing things about this book, I had to give it a read.  What I found was not exactly what I expected.  While some sources have described the Dru character as a "sinister dictator", the truth is not quite so interesting.  The book itself is nowhere near as interesting.  Upon opening the book to the table of contents, one can't help but take notice of the number of chapters in this book.  There are 53 chapters in just 173 pages!  For those of you who don't have a math minor, that's a little over 3 pages per chapter.  And for some reason, many of the chapters are explicit continuations of the chapter before.  What was the point of this?  Why not keep the two chapters a single chapter?   Needless to say, the writing here is atrocious.  The plot is paper-thin, the characters don't develop one iota, and a romance sub-plot rears its ugly head on the last two pages of the book!  How was this book published?  Why was it put into print?  Therein lies the intrigue.  While it was anonymously written at the time, it is today well-known that the author of this book was Colonel Edward Mandell House (he gives a little hint in the text when two characters meet at Mandell House [yeesh!]), who was the virtual co-president of the United States with Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson admitted time and again that House was his "alter ego", even to the point that House was given accomodations in the White House.  Why is all this important?  Philip Dru leads a revolution against the United States government.  Not a bad thing in and of itself, if the reasons had been more compelling.  What happens in the aftermath, however, brings shudders to students of history.  Philip Dru becomes dictator of the United States, without too much reservation.  He tosses out the national constitution, as well as the state constitutions, and has them rewritten.  He institutes a graduated income tax (which did not exist at that time in the U.S. because it was ruled unconstitutional;  however, with the "ratification" of the 16th amendment just a year or two after the publication of this book, we got one for the first time and have lived under it ever since), forces popular election of senators, nationalizes industry, and reorganizes the entire government at his whim.  And Dru is definitely portrayed as the friendly protagonist.  If the First Lady were to write a book calling for revolution, abolition of the constitution, and a unitary dictator, would we worry?  I sure hope so.    But more worrisome is the fact that all of these thing eventually did come to pass in this country.  (Sure, the constitution wasn't abolished and rewritten.  However, the New Deal Supremee Court made rulings that effectively gave Congress carte-blanche to pass ANY law it felt like, even those that explicitly violate the constitution [see USA PATRIOT Act]).  Was House prescient?  Did he simply see the tides of popular opinion swarming over the masses?  Or was he simply one of the many manipulating the domestic policy of our republic behind the scenes?  The structure and execution of this book are amateurish at best, more likened to the writing of a 10th grader than any kind of real author.  Perhaps that is the point.  This book was clearly aimed at the unwashed masses.  Every piece of dialog in this book espouses the benefits of socialism and evil of capitalism.  But this effort is so transparent that it leaves us with nothing of any literary merit, and in its place only political ramblings of a clear Fabian socialist.  These ramblings, of course, entail bringing up relevant issues and injustices (female suffrage, corporate exploitation) and packaging them with solutions that involve only the addition and centralization of power in the federal government.  While those who educate themselves will see this work for what it is, the many people who read this book (not today, since people don't read, but back then there were probably more than a few) would end up buying into bad solutions for exaggerated problems.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this book.  The price simply doesn't justify it.  A reader will gain no enjoyment from it.  This book only redeems itself in its historical context:  it was written by a man who pushed Woodrow Wilson to sign the Federal Reserve Act, which destroyed our economy and continues to devalue our money to this day;  to lead us into World War I, despite his campaign promises not to (the Lusitania was carrying English munitions and was a valid military target); and to attempt to sacrifice the sovereignty of our nation to a world governing body in the League of Nations, which our Congress rightly rejected 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 I would be willing to accept a so-called "light-hearted romp" or farce, or whatever, but please! Even with the bar set that low, this book manages to miss the mark.  The premise of the book is entirely implausible. The whole spying plot is a pointless game - the spies' goal seems to be to merely annoy the bad guys, and the bad guys are the most cliche-ridden Snidely Whiplash villians imaginable - yet at the same time they can be vanquished by a scolding on manners. The hero allows himself to be distracted from his mission by trivialities - not a very reliable spy, I guess. It's unclear why he even has a cloak and mask - what would be point of that, anyway? And why does he enter and exit his home through the front door while wearing cloak and mask? The heroine seems omniscient, with her leaps to fantastic and coincidental conclusions, her access to royal papers and conversations, and ability to know exactly where the hero is imprisoned.  I'm not even sure what the characters' motivations are. Why do they even care who's on the throne? They don't seem to dwell on it much - even the death of another spy doesn't seem to bother them much.   The writing is formulaic and laden with cliches. We have saucy minxes stamping their feet prettily, the obligatory device where the hero and heroine's initial dislike for one another has to be overcome by love; flaring nostrils; everyone exclaiming "Drat!" when foiled....Characters scowl with anger, "oomph" and "oof" in slapstick scenes, and pace with anger. And of course the parallel modern-day story is ridden with updated cliches of the same kind.  The thing reads like a George Hamiliton b-movie spoof of a Zorro movie. Maybe that was the author's intent. But it lacks the wit and originality of one. And yes, I'm being sarcastic.  
 I expected good things from this book, but was surprised to find it offered very little useful advice.  The examples of what to do in certain situations must have been jokes, they were that inappropriate and irrelevant to real life.  Amazingly, the book was also racist at times, making odd comments about Muslims.  I actually tossed this book in the garbage, a first for me. 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it. 	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it.   
 This book, is not for newcomers to statistics. It often assumes a well versed backround in probability and statistics (and I suppose a decent background in calculus). There is often little explanation for examples and theorems. Often the exercises and examples require the solution to previous exercises. This is extremely frustrating and often discouraging. Many times I would find myself being refered to an example in a previous or future chapter whose solution refers to a problem that needs to worked out. I have an undergraduate degree in math and am by no means a genius, but compared to many well written math texts, the clarity and conciseness leaves much to be desired. The exercises do not go from easier to more difficult but from difficult to difficult. Often the concept that is trying to be illustrated could be done in a much simpler problem.  That all said, the book is fairly well written given the aforementioned weaknesses. My professors seem to like it as do a couple of PhD students 
 I have no idea how this book has received the ratings it has so far. I am a Lead Software Verification Engineer and am a perl programmer (for 10 years now) and found this book a complete waste of time and money. It has zero new ideas. The book tells you how to write standard tests for perl (this could have been accomplished in 2 pages). I love the format of the book. Please look elswhere if you wanna learn about perl or testing or perl testing 
 Original time window too long.  Book never received.  Told to wait two weeks longer.  Still no book.  Had to buy it elsewhere for reading group.  Book is excellent.  A1book service poor 
 I really wanted to like this book after enjoying both Heath's and Chloe's stories very much.  It just felt too much like Drake was taking unfair advantage of Eloise's position and the whole situation began to seem very sordid.  I wish the author had left out the mistress angle and just let these two fall in love and get married.  I felt uncomfortable reading it 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 I can fix this! This movie never happened. Now we need to make Starship Troopers 2. I will contribute a few bucks. If we all contribute, we can get an actual director to come along, preferably the one from the first movie, get us some big time sponsors, and make us one heck of a Starship Troopers 2! There, I have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake Starship Troopers 2 caused us all 
 Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in 
 I bought this DVD after reading all the 5 star reviews, and I must admit, I was very disappointed.  I am an avid reader of books and watcher of movies about Van Gogh, so it wasn't the fact that this movie told nothing about Van Gogh that bothered me, but the sheer dryness and feel of the film as a whole.  The only real information the movie reveals about Van Gogh is a short text paragraph at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the film is just John Hurt reading Van Gogh's letters to his brother while the screen shows flashes of some of Van Gogh's paintings, as well as random shots of landscapes.  While this works for a little while, after a few minutes it becomes tedious and boring.  I didn't even make it all the way through the movie-only about 45 minutes.  I wish I could give this a better review, and some people may say my view is too simple, but that's how I see it.  If you're looking for facts about Van Gogh presented in an entertaining manner, I don't recommend this DVD

 I'm an (unemployed) agronomist and I live in Brazil.About this book, I must tell you that I readn't it.In fact, a friend of me, send parts of this bad book to me, by e-mail, from America. She was scare, about the doomed prophecies of this book. There's so many frauds writen in this book, that I can't count the majority of then. 1)This book claims that end of nitrogen from natural gas, will doom modern agriculture and spread famine.In fact, fertilizers with nitrogen can (and are) be produced with hydrogen from eletrolysis of water, using wind, hydro or nuclear energy.At the same time, using genetical engeneering, vegetables such as corn or wheat will produce his own nitrogen.We must see that soybean don't use nitrogen's fertilizers, because bacterias inside his roots made his nitrogen's fertilizers, without artificial fertilizers.This second alternative will produce cheap harvests, without fertlizers with nitrogen. 2)This book claims that climbing oil prices will doom the world.In fact, whith more oil's price, the alternatives of oil will became better than ever.Ethanol in Brazil costs less then US$50,00 each brent.The Athabasca's oil sands are bigger than all Iraq's oil reserves.The shale oil has trillions of brents in the world.If you ad hydrogen to corn plant, you will produce oil.In other words:there's many future alternatives to the oil.  The real big menace, to the world, is the same:religion. Nuclear bombs from Pakisthan, Iran or any other source are real menaces.Mad strong men from North Korea or China are also possible menaces in the future.  
 Now I like Neruda. I think he is an important poet, and I fully expected to love this collection. But as I read it I found that I didn't really like any of the poems. There were a few that were almost passable, but only a couple. I don't know if it was Merwin's translation, Neruda's writing, or just me not connecting with the poetry. I say read Neruda, just not this collection 
 If you're going to release an album called Rick Springfield's Greatest Hits, how do you omit his greatest hit?  "Honeymoon in Beirut" is by far the best song the guy did --   It's like when people talk about the Police's Synchronicity album and they say "Every Breath You Take" is the best song --   Hello? "Tea in the Sahara" is the song that exemplifies what that album was about.........anyway.........  Rick had a lot of great songs, but to leave out his best one and put some of the clunkers that are on this album is inexcusable.  
 I like the story, I like the movie, but the book was impossible to read.  It was just too broken up with a lot of slang - maybe if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have enjoyed it, but after a few pages I put the book down, it just wasn't worth the effort 
 i have just finished reading cannibals and kings by marvin harris. i am an  avid reader and can put a 200 page book away with ease. cannibals and kings  however took me over a month to put myself through it. harris' dry humor  mixed with completely boring material does not make a best seller. i  understand thaat the origin of mankind can not be the most interesting  topic no matter who writes it, but with harris behind the pen this book is  headed for disater. i recommend this book with anyone who has sleeping  problems becuase everytime i started to read a few lines from this book i  was sleeping liek a baby with in 5 minutes 
 I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller 
 I would not buy this router. As I am on my second one from Netgear and it still having issues. This router will not stay up and it drops the internet connection every day. Please buy something else or you're be sorry like I am

 The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.  This "most correct book" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one 
 In addition to the 'deification' of Robert Parker, noted by another reviewer, the book shows a surprising level of ugly American. Given the author's history, I had expected better. When I reached the bit where the author tsked 'those bad frenchies' who 'forgot we saved their bacon in WWII', I gave up. The subject matter the author follows could have made a good book, but in the end did not 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
 I read this book two months ago and I just woke up now.   Yeah, yeah, I know: 0 out of X people found this review helpful 
 This series has become a complete disaster.  As the plot gets more and more complicated, it also gets more and more meaningless.  Mr. Jordan is apparently set on dragging this series out for another ten books at least.  New subplots are introduced with each book, and there are now so many characters that it is hard to keep their names straight.  There has been little to no development on the overall plot since the fourth book.  It seems to me that if Rand suddenly died, and the plot ended, it would take another three books to tell what happened to the rest of the characters! (in exhaustive detail, of course)  I generally find myself cheering when a character dies because it means that there will be one less person to hear about in the next book.  Improbable events happen regularly, in order to stretch the series as far as possible.  For example, most of the Forsaken have been killed by the seventh book.  ("Damn!," thinks Mr. Jordan, "I had planned to keep them around until book 27")  Instead of bringing out the next logical bad guy, the Dark One, the Forsaken are now being brought back to life, so that Rand has to kill them all again!  This is such a poor excuse for a plot event that I laughed when I first read it.  Similar events include Egwene becoming the Amyrlin seat and Birgitte becoming Elayne's warder.  The characters are vain, immature, and unlikeable.  They are mostly involved in unlikely romances, usually with multiple people.  The men mope about, feel sorry for themselves, and make unbelievably stupid decisions.  The women are cattish, delight in tormenting the men, and are astonishingly ungrateful.  I have yet to find a truly symapthetic character.  Character relationships are just as bad. (Mr. Jordan is more obsessed with sex than Sigmund Freud was.)  Disliking a person seems to be the only prerequisite for falling in love with them.    Though this has been harped on in previous reviews, it is absolutely true: Mr. Jordan is completely obsessed with writing about insignificant little details.  From exactly what each and every character is wearing to exactly what each and every character is thinking, in each and every scene of the book, Mr. Jordan lists everything that is unimportant to the story.  Below is a description of a character blowing their nose (I have chosen Nynaeve), in the style of the Wheel of Time series.  You can see the excess of unnecessary details used to describe any action.      "Nynaeve excused herself from the conversation about why Rand hadn't seen Elayne.  Gathering up the hem of her Domani dress in pale green silk, Lan's favorite color, she turned away from the women at the table, who were entusiastically chattering on about Rand's personal affairs.  'Ninnies,' thought Nynaeve, "they should be doing something useful, not idling their time away here.  If they were from Emond's Field when I was wisdom there, the women's circle would set them right'.  She sniffed loudly is their direction, and gave her braid a violent tug.  She put her hand into the pocket of her high-necked gown, and drew out a red linen handkerchief, with an attractive paisley border.  She remebered that it had been a gift from Lan from when he had still been Moiraine's warder.  Her cross expression softened as her thoughts turned to Lan.  She absent-mindedly tugged down the neckline of her dress, exposing a wide expanse of pale bosom, and fiddled with a strand of pearls that she wore around her neck.  Lan liked pearls, she remembered.  She wondered what the other women at the table would say if she got a room at the inn to share with him.  They would probably say she was behind as forward as that Mayener hussy, Berelain.  She suddenly realized what she was thinking about.  'Light burn Lan for making me think about Berelain,' she said to herself, 'men can be so mule headed sometimes.'  She resolved to box the ears of the next man she met, just for being born a man.  Elayne, who was sitting down at the table next to her, asked Nynaeve if she liked the new light blue silk dress with the lace collar that she was wearing.  'Hmmph,' said Nynaeve, 'it probably cost as much as a small village.  You should be more careful with money Elayne.  We are not in your mother's paalce at Caemlyn.'  She gave her braid another angry tug."  If you have read any of the other Wheel of Time books, my advice is: do not read any more.  This series hasn't gone anywhere since the fourth book, nor does it shows signs of going anywhere in the future.  Robert Jordan will almost certainly die before he is able to finish of this series 
 there...I think my title best describes how I feel about this piece of junk! Read all the reviews..I have the same complaints...from the cord up to the handle. this vacuum leaves me cussing every time I use it. And I am not that kind of person but this just brings out the worst in me. I especially love cleaning my house but ever since I got this vacuum, I dread the day I had to clean my house, knowing how painful and horrible it will be. I should have bought Hoover instead. My last Hoover lasted 11 years before I had to buy this garbage. Hoover may be a bit pricey but it sure as hell's worth it 
 Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it. 	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it.   
 When I bought this book, I wasn't exactly sure what the author's viewpoint would be, but expected a fairly rigorous treatment on the history of church & state issues in America.  I thought this might lead to some meaningful conclusions.  To say the least, I was disappointed.  This is a work which is long on rationalizations, but short on rationale.  Meacham largely sidesteps the critical questions and instead wallpapers over them with anecdotes about the support that presidents and other leaders have given to expressions of "public religion".  He seems to build his whole case out of historical inertia rather than a clear-headed and logical analysis of law.  Meacham points demonstrably toward the fact that presidents have consistently expressed their religious beliefs in public, but completely ignores the reality that those are the kind of people who get elected to national office.  Is someone with strong non-theistic leanings likely to become Commander-In-Chief?  Of course not.  It is important to recognize, however, that this is a bias which is built into the political climate, not the Constitution.  Yes, there is a longstanding history of infusing religion into the public sphere, but this hardly supports the author's contention that it would be impractical for things to be any other way.  He only demonstrates the limits of his imagination and vision.  If he offered a strong case for his views, that would be one thing, but he largely obfuscates the most important questions by offering a collection of stories which really doesn't make much of a point.  In the end, if you're looking for tales about the religious perspectives of various presidents, give this book a read.  The content is hardly riveting, but you may find a few points of interest.  If you want an objective analysis and detailed exploration of the issues which divide our nation on the question of separation of church and state, you won't find it here. 
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 I had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. It did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then I couldn't leave well enough alone. I must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time IN MY LIFE (I'm 29), I have acne on my chin. The chin is the only place I used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. Not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! The only thing that I've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. Leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself. 
 Those of you who don't think that there is anything particularly wrong with just how much McCoy errs in this book dishonour the very people that you only claim to honour.  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves...but not half so much as McCoy for tossing out this rubbish just to make a quick quid by riding the newest wave of 'Celtomania' 
 THOU SHALT NOT was a disappointing show because the source material (THERESE RAQUIN) has the potential to be a powerful musical.  Harry Connick Jr. penned the words and music for this show, yet it seems he has never studied some of the Broadway classics (from OKLAHOMA! thru RAGTIME) to learn how to use songs to develop character and advance the story.  He has come up with some great tunes here, but rarely do they seem to have much in common with the tragic story.  One notable exception is "The Other Hours" which is perfectly suited to the moment.  "Take her to the Mardi Gras" is a geat up-tempo dance number, but much of the rest plays like a collection of songs rater than numbers which are part of an integrated story.  Connick says he hopes to continue to work on Broadway and as I write this in March 2006 he is starring in a smash-hit revival of PAJAMA GAME.  Broadway can certainly use a composer of his talent, and we can only hope that he learns how to weave story and character into his songs for a future musical.  The cast on this CD is first-rate: Nobert Leo Butz, Craig Bierko, Kate Levering, Debra Monk are all fine. The CD is well-produced but the booklet contains only the lyrics and no notes about the show or a synopsis. Also no label or catalogue number. It seems to be a private release.  Copies were sent to Tony voters when the score was nominated (it lost to URINETOWN)and then with little fanfare the CD started showing up on Amazon and other web-retailers and in speciatly shops like New York's Footlight Records, but it has never been given general distribution.  Was this prduction jinxed? Previews had to be delayed a week because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Opening night Craig Bierko was accidently hit in the throat durring a fight scene and was out of the show for 2 weeks.  Kate Levering spained an ankle and was also forced out of the show for a  spell.  Maybe the ghost of Camille Raquin is more powerful than we thought 
 Turn of the Century is so boring and slow moving that it's not worth reading. In the first half of the book, literally close to nothing happens. Added to which, Anderson makes the book so convoluted it's like a badly executed Altman ensemble drama. It's impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they're actually like. Added to which, the highly trumpeted 'Tom Wolfe' style satire in the book is so blunt and obvious that one wonders how many made the connection between Anderson and the esteemed writer of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. Bottom line: boring, dull and pretty stupid really 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book because it was supposed to deal with the emotional aftermath of an extremely difficult issue (abortion more so than the clinic shooting) faced by a young girl with an unwanted pregnancy.  Rather than discussng this topic in a meaningful way, the book spiraled down into extreme pro-life propoganda and ended up sounding completely ridiculous.  Basically, the basis of the book consists of the following:  Abortion doctors are alcoholics, operate on their patients while drunk, and molest their patients because the patients "don't have any virtue left anyway."  Abortion clinic owners get filthy rich from running abortion clinics and abuse their spouses.  Abortion clinics purposely make women wait to have abortions until the fetus is more developed (even if the woman wants the abortion right away in the first trimester) so the clinic can sell fetus body parts and make more money.  The state health regulators let abortion clinics do whatever they want and ignore any applicable health regulations.  The pro-life advocates, who are all perfect angels, are really the ones who get threatened and harassed and are being unfairly blamed for threats to abortion clinics.  In fact, the shooting at the abortion clinic in this story was really masterminded by the abortion clinic owner to get rid of the drunk doctor.  This book was SO extreme - and is admittedly a story of fiction - yet continued to set forth certain scenarios and statistics as "truth."  I found it embarassing and the prose was not written particularly well.  It does not contribute to the abortion debate in any meaningful way.  I am going to see if I can return this book to Amazon.  I wanted to give it no stars but Amazon makes you have a minimum of one star 
 Although the book has great illustrations, it just doesn't give much information.  Yes, the author discusses the sharpening of virtually every cutting instrument, but usually only using a certain jig that you probably don't have.  There is little depth to this book; it's like a vast ocean that is only an inch deep.  The book is a better review of sharpening tools and jigs on the market than it is about sharpening, and if you have these tools, you don't need the book to tell you how to use them.    I would have liked to see in-depth sharpening information- what a tool that is sharp looks like and how to get it there with basic tools.  The book rarely achieves this.  
 The only song that sounds FAIRLY good is "Wild mountain thyme" (and thats still just a cover). The byrds are great - when they do folk rock. Here they obviously tried to be "different" and "original" and whatsever. Most of the songs got no melody, they are just failed hippie experiments. And just listen to "Captain soul"! Sounds like children in elementary school that just have learned taking blues chords. Im so embarrased I own this record 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 "The Princess and the Pea" by Janet Stevens is the retelling of the famous Hans Christian Andersen tale. This time, we get beautiful pictures, reminiscent of Maurice Sendak, and a bland story.  The typeface is an uninspired black Times New Roman, placed unimaginatively at the bottom of each page.  The Plot: A prince wanted to test his beloved to see if she were a real princess. His mother demanded that the prince be sure. Each time the prince met someone he fell in love, she failed the test. One could not play soft music, another ate like a pig, and still another could not dance.  When a rainstorm brought in a young tiger who claimed to be a princess, the queen decided to lay out 20 mattresses with a pea beneath them all. Would the young tiger sense the pea and prove she was a real princess?  The story is all there. The problem is that there is nothing exciting in the language. There is no alliteration or assonance, and no word play. The writer goes through the motion of storytelling without ever bringing the story from her heart into the child's.  Better retellings are out there, and the illustrations, as good as they are, are not so much as to make the book a worthy purchase.  Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 I am not good at using Amazon reviews but I wrote one a few days ago about this book. I can't find the review I wrote on this site, but maybe I am not good at this.  I said the book was upside down and backwards (which was true). I'll ad mit I was not enthused with the content. Amazon did not reply to me but the author, Yali Friedman sent the 2nd edition to me with a hand-written apolgy for the poor construction of the book I bought. I think this is admirable and impressive.  I will read the second edition and maybe, if I can figure out how, provide a review. 
 I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one. The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for 
 The care and attention given to character and relationship development in seasons 1-3 are gone from 4-5.  Silly plots, many based on 1980s trends, i.e.: divorce rates, bored housewives in rebellion, aerobics, consumerism made my eyes roll.  The suburban episode was the worst-the first Asian characters on the series were Japanese tourists with big cameras and lo and behold, latent martial arts skills that came in handy at the end. It's like season 4 was all about being campy, and I missed the good writing.  It was such a different direction for the show than in previous seasons. The romance element is inexplicably headed backwards- the character of Laura Holt has practically become an ice queen and Remington is left to make cheesy passes and be happy with a goodnight kiss.  What was up with Laura-abuse in the last Season 4 episode?  Meanwhile, the writers seemed to turn their interest towards beautifying Mildred who has had a fashion transformation. She also delivers one-liners every time she opens her mouth.    I agree that the airline and butler episodes were better. 
 Jackson and his colleague have amassed essays from homosexual men and lesbians of non-English descent down under.  Few books have discussed ethnic and racial differences in Australia and this is truly an important intervention.  It is great for a comparison of race and sexuality between Australia and the United States.  However, the absence of Aboriginal [homosexual] writing is noticeable.  If this book is accurate, minority [homosexuals] in Australia are decades behind their counterparts in the United States in terms of activism, publishing, and a host of other topics; the editors fail to acknowledge this either.  Also, the editing is a bit haphazard.  The authors say one Asian [homosexual] contributor got a fact wrong.  Well, why not edit his article correctly rather than make him look stupid?  The submissions are pretty evenly divided between men and women.  Those who collect [homosexual] Judaic studies texts may especially be interested in this book.  There are American books that are soooooo much better; but this could be a valuable tool for comparative ethnic studies scholars 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Pretty useless series of short observations, not very inspiring & quite disappointing given the names of the contributors. Definitely not worth the money 
 This boring mess just made me put on the originals - which are SO GREAT. A pointless release.  Another reviewer knocked the duos's last release "Nightbird" - however I found that the most refreshing recording they had done in ages.  This feels like a contractual obligation and sounds like how an unsalted saltine with generic peanut butter would taste.  Go for the originals 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 Total nerd. His balloon pants looked like he was carrying a heavy load in the back. P-U! And what about those horrible shades 
 I read this book while doing research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL, the Complete Book on How to Curb your Cursing.  I give the editor credit for the compilation, but for what purpose?  Some of the expressions are clever,  some are funny, but most are not.  People who read this book looking for  new ways to express themselves should determine if they will come across as  amusing or just crass.  While I believe the basic word has some value,  promoting its use is a social disservice. The fact that the book has  received so many favorable reviews reflects the decline of civility and the  dumbing down of both our language and our concept of what is funny. My book  has an entire chapter on this word that is not only more amusing, but also  thought provoking 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 ...but,sorry,I don't like it at all !  Patchy and messy,it's the usual overstuffed latin omelette!  They have definitely lost their hedge.  Even after multiple listens,I couldn't remember one single riff.  Unknown musicians playing on Ocean Drive restaurants in Miami Beach are more inspired and can do better!  I'm wondering why aren't they more adventurous ?!  ..eventually letting Celine Dion sing in their band..  Seriously !! 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 I am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon.  Trust me, I am not someone who claims to be a music expert, but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and Jazz fusion.  I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic, Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski Martin Wood).  In general I am open to all kinds of funky music, and Umphrey's usually puts out.  In my opinion, this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311).  With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal.  Like I said, they fuse genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete failure in the areas I have described above.  First off, I can understand how reviewers point to the production quality, and the musical talent displayed throughout the album.  Umphreys Mcgee is insanely talented, and no effort could hide that from the listener.  HOWEVER, to be blunt this album is boring as hell, has no funk or rock in it period, and is frankly somewhat depressing.  IF your expecting wild guitar improv, explosive beats and fun, uplifting music--ignore this album.  If you are a fan of Umphrey's live show and their past albums--ignore this album.  If you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier, jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation--do not buy this album.  The only way I can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album.  Slow songs without enough music, little variance from song to song, depressing lyrics, and a slow pace.  Some say this is Umphreys showing their full range, I say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable.  The only reason I wrote this review is that Im amazed by the other reviews on this page.  I wish I had never heard this album, it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as Umphreys Mcgee.  They missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation, this album is a step in the wrong direction. I strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music, rather than production quality and introspective lyrics, to steer way clear of this album.  This was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release I have ever heard (including By the Way from RHCP, which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to Safety in Numbers) 
 The book had lots of good information, but only line drawings of the cows.  I was disappointed in not having color photos since this was an identification book 
 I expected much better quality for the price,  when the book arrived the last 25 pages or so were not even glued into the binding.  Poor workmanshi 
 I bought this book primarily for information regarding accounting and general ledger systems. I read all the great reviews here and thought this would be a great book.  I am very disappointed.  The entire section on accounting is only 40 pages and contains only a cursory overview of accounting systems and structures. They include a CD with the book which is supposed to contain actual SQL data structures but you have to pay them $350.00 to unlock the CD.  Given the depth of the book I would be reluctant to risk paying them that much for simple data structures which you can easily find elsewhere on the web for free.  In all honesty I have not studied this book fully but in my opinion it was a waste of money and I will try to return it to Amazon.  
 My goodness this book droned on and on about belonging and longing without any real wisdom coming through. I will never buy a book again because someone else said it was good I lost money on this one 
 Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans 
 Well essentially the book is 'Unleashing the Demonic World's Potential by John Edward 
 I was extremely excited to start this book.  I am extremely glad that I am done with it.  I still don't really know what the point of the story was or really what I read.  I had to go over some chapters again just to figure out what character the author was referring to.  I think that other reveiws were correct in saying that it is hard to know which character was which in the high school segments because there was no reference by name.  I think that the concept of the book was interesting, however, follow through just wasn't there 
 This book provides an interesting framework but lacks the modern thinking of the Third Wave by Smith and Fingar and contains more of the old Business Process Reengineering stuf 
 i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine.  i'm sorry.  maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 Hey, wanna buy a copy of this waste of polycarbonate? Buck fifty in the used listings! Bwahahahahaaa! Pretty soon it'll be one cent like the listings for Hanson CDs. If you like ska, get into the Specials, Elvis Costello, first-wave Jamaican ska, rocksteady etc. This is the CHAFF, duders. Get a little taste. (See? I like ska! Pbttttt!)  Edit 9/23/06: Shpank me 
 It has a very loose fit and I feel a little silly, but pulling it out of the package I totally forgot how exactly this thing should look on me. It is made like a very unflattering potato sack sadly 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 The book starts with a study from the 1930's that showed that it took four generations for cats to recover from a cooked food diet. A study that advances Lamarckian theory is an inauspicious start for any book, let alone a book that could endanger the life of your favorite friend and companion, your dog.   To a very large extent, this book bases its theories on what is "natural" for your dog, e.g. what your dog would do in the wild. Since there are no references to studies of the diet and lifespan of domesticated dogs that have reverted to a feral state, you will have to take on faith that your highly domesticated animal is either akin to a wild wolf, or that a feral dog is healthier than your animal that will probably live well over a decade. My Border Collie wouldn't make it a week in the wild, let alone five years.  Exposure to heartworm, fluke, trichinosis, and other parasites is dangerous and a leading cause of death for any wild mammal. Exposure to e-coli, salmonella and other food-born bacteria is highly dangerous - diarrhea is the number one cause of death in human infants in the world. I won't risk my dog's life because cooked food is so "deadly" due to build up of "toxins" as this book proposes. I have weighed the risks and have come up "no contest" for cooked food. There are Web resources that refute the safety of giving your dog raw chicken necks, backs and wings. I feel the very real risk of choking, injury to gums, teeth, throat, stomach and intestines from long-term use of bones in the diet far outweigh unsubstantiated and anectodotal evidence that this will keep my 50 lb. animal healthier. See secondchanceranch.org/rawmeat.html for a serious debunking of these theories.    You will need to do some critical thinking about the "natural" argument. Do you think you would make it over 40 living like a caveman without sanitary plumbing and indoor heating, a clean water supply and cooked food? Believe me, in places where they don't have it, they don't. Do further research before exposing your omnivorous, highly domesticated mammal to this level of risk 
 I have all Michael's videos, I have all Bulls videos..and I thought this one would be different. Maybe the last video we'll ever see about Michael and this dinasty, and the did it with all scences from past videos. Ive  seen all before! , nothing new?  scences from air time, playground, bulls  videos, come fly with me, above and beyond..nothing new!  I think that  nobody showed anything about last championship run (I mean the locker room  scences after the title, grant park, or something different) Im very  dissapointe 
 "The Ramayana - Valmiki" is abridged and translated by Arshia Sattar. The author information does not appear with the book. The author as "Valmiki" is misleading.  This book is NOT by C. Rajagopalachari as mentioned by few reviewers. 
 This book is very ineresting, accurate accounts of the battles fought during this period, This book brought back memories of the winter that we had to endure plus the Germans. I was there for most of the time and attest to the worst winter of the century. 
 Our book club all read this as our first Ian Mcewan book.  It was so short that the exact history/relationship of the couple is never established.  You don't know enough about the couple to care much about them, so the ending seems disturbing as it comes out of nowhere and seems to be the ONLY interesting thing to happen in the book.  
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 This novel was our February Book group text. It was not hard to read and had a restful quality about it. Unfortunately it did not say very much at all to me or other members of the group. Many of the characters were underdeveloped and there were hints at interesting aspects of their personalities but it did not go any further than that, so left me with a feeling of frustration and irritation. I appreciate that her forte is writing about quiet village life and the attention to detail of very mundane events but I think this can be taken too far 
 How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman 
 This book has a high "fog factor" and is difficult to read.  It uses academic jargon and long sentences.  The structure is complex and confusing.  That is not to say that the book is inconsequential; indeed, the subject matter is quite important.  It is simply difficult to access it through this book.  The back cover accurately describes the book as looking systematically at the families and offspring of the upper echelon of the Hudson Bay Company and the North West Company.  Unfortunately, this was a male-dominated business and a male-dominated period in history.  Men kept the written records.  The author of "Strangers in Blood" relies heavily on anecdotal accounts of individuals, complete with many direct quotes.  Thus, this is a book that follows the men of the fur trade.  Their wives and offspring become adjuncts.  The book partially compensates for this by providing information on societal pressures within the fur trade, as well as in Canada and England at the time.  It also addresses the policies of the fur companies relative to dependents.  The book characterizes and contrasts family connections in the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company.  The presentation is roughly chronological from the late 1700 to the mid 1800s.  The 1821 merger of the two companies is a focal point.  Chapters and subchapters move back and forth between the two companies; as well as between various topics of gender and types of family relationships.  The focus is on individuals, with every page containing a confusing array of proper names.  The names of key individuals (men) reappear constantly until the reader longs for a wall chart to keep them straight.  The author has even provided a few small pieces of such a chart and they are helpful.  One comes away with the feeling that the men of the fur trade took more responsibility for their families than one might expect.  They usually tried to place their offspring, both male and female, in a position to start a life of their own.  That included at least some education; an apprenticeship for men, and marriage for women.  Fewer men stayed committed to the mothers of their children but some of the relationships were life-long.  From the early 1820s on, one man, George Simpson, had great influence over the fur trade and the people involved with it.  He directed the Hudson Bay Company through the merger with the Northwest Company and for forty years afterward.  He influenced the tenor of the fur trade and everything connected with it.  Ms Brown shows his impact to be more negative than positive.  Simpson, the clergy, and English women all arrived on the scene at about the same time.  The result was increased racism, emphasis on class, and moral disapproval of "country marriages."  These semi-formal unions with Indians and mixed-bloods were prevalent in the fur trade up until that time.  The problems of integrating the descendents of the fur traders into society continue in Canada today.  Finally, I even want to complain about the title.  "Strangers in Blood" is an English legal term for relationships that exist "in blood" but the law refuses to admit as legitimate.  This book is about a much broader range of relationships.  The author recognizes the problem in the final chapter.  Someone in the publishing process should have insisted on a better title. 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 This man lives in a world od distorted reality.  Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production.  Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me.  He talks about Cuba in this book...  The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better?  Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better.  However, I hate the message that it sends 
 Schneiderman's "Leonardo's Laptop" is singularly disappointing.  Promising to raise our expectation of what we should get from technology, he instead uses a forced extended metaphor in the form of Leonardo da Vinci.  What would Leonardo do?, we are repeatedly asked.  Schneiderman attempts to answer the question.  Sadly, his answers are neither new nor groundbreaking.  I cannot believe that Leonardo would simply recount solutions that are already available and attempt to make such solutions sound visionary and forward-thinking.  The chapters in the book discuss the issues with usability today, activites and relationships, and attempt to discuss future directions in several fields: government, healthcare, business, and education.  In these chapters, Schneiderman uses feel-good buzzwords like 'empowering' and 'enabling', but never moves beyond the feel-good buzzwords to suggest real solutions.  In most cases, he suggests solutions that are already implemented; in others, he simply waves his hands at the problem and says that there has to be a solution.  Each chapter concludes with a skeptic's corner.  This section could easily be re-labelled the strawman's corner.  In that section, he constructs arguments that skeptics might use, but he must assume that skeptics are uniformly moronic.  The so-called skeptical arguments are drawn with exceptionally rough strokes, which he dispenses of with little regard to very real concerns that can and should be discussed.    I had high hopes for this book.  I wanted something that pushed the boundaries.  I wanted something visionary.  Instead, I got a repetitive book that somehow didn't say anything.  I can only hope that future works give us something better than this.  
 This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative. I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis.  Just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character, and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges.  The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions.  He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact.  Jim Hellwig declined, & used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit. This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world, but it was too shortlived.  Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory, but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair, Piper, Hogan, and the most respected of all The Undertaker 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Lee Eisenberg's "The Number" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted.  Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's "Personal Finance for Dummies", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person.  
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 I picked this up at my Babies R Us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror, I would be able to keep an eye on her. From the minute I brought it home, it smelled awful, like artificial grapes. I have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks.  At this point I am just going to throw it out because I can't imagine having that smell in my car! (I have since been back to Babies R Us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad, and they do.) Don't buy it without smelling it 
 Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.   Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly. 
 How come when I get a book on hair care, it doesn't talk much about hair care? This book is like a hair autobiography. I actually think it's just a bunch of filler because the author doesn't even offer that much hair advice. It's basic stuff that you should already know if you have eyes to see and ears to hear.   Anway, she advocates using a texturizer to smooth the kinkiest of hair. It's kind of funny, but right now it's stylish to have nappy hair-only if it's fake or has a texturizer in it. Whenever I look through a "natural" hair magazine, all I see are nappy weaves. That doesn't make sense to me: why buy a fake nappy hair piece when you can grow it from your scalp for free?Don't be fooled by the texturizers.  It doesn't matter if you get it done at home or at a salon- a texturizer is just a relaxer slapped on your head and rinsed out after 5-10 minutes. A texturizer won't make your hair easier to manange or give you curls like Tracee Ellis Ross or Rachel True. A texturizer is a chemical, it's ruff, and you *will* be considering a weave eventually, depending on how frequently  you texturize.  But back to the book. Lonnice wears her hair in twist out and shows all the marvelous styles she can make. Whoop dee do. What's hilarious is how there are three photographs showing her hair getting long and longer from wearing a twist out for a few days. Don't be fooled by that either. All she's doing is tilting her neck back. Some chicks on haircare websites do stuff like that. They'll post a message that says, "Look! My hair grew 4.5 inches this month from the 100 vitamin pills I'm taking!" When you see their "new growth," it's not growth at all but necks being tilted all the way back. But folks get excited anyway. Whatever!  The best hair care book I read is "No Lye" by Tulani Kinard. There are pictures of damaged hair, different hairstyles, oils to use, etc. It's a good book to read and get some advice if you're natural but keep in mind that only YOU know what's good for your hair to keep it healthy. Don't run out and get a texturizer because someone said so 
 Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick 
 The moment I saw this book in our local bookstore, I quickly grabbed it. The title is very eye-catching since I'm very interested about the sciences, and Geography is one fascinating subject. The book is written in simple terms and easy to understand. What I didn't like about the book is that it's explicitly very biased against the creation theory. On the earlier pages, the author clearly stated that science is dynamic which I or presumably anyone will understand that when it comes to the sciences nothing is certain. Yet the author appears to be preaching the THEORY of evolution as a fact. I thought books like this calls for unbiased and unpartial content. So I scanned the back pages looking for his credentials. And I found my evidence, "don't know much about Davis".  
 This book is all over the place with little documentation for asserted theories. I would not waste my time or money on this book. Let's just put it this way, 25 cents in my yard sale is going to be overpricing it 
 It's hard to say if Beth Teitell even likes her two children.  The whole book is about how they inconvenience her and her husband.  When I read the description of this book, I expected to find heartwarming stories of a woman who enjoys her children yet has some bumps in the road.  Basically, from page one she complains about how much work it is to be a parent.  I'm not sure why she ever had another child after she found out what it was like with the first one.  I know that some people will find these stories funny and enjoy reading the book, but after I read that she considered nap time a time when she could "get credit for being with her children but not have to do anything" I was appalled!  Imagine how her children will feel some day knowing this is what she truly thinks of them 
 I was searching for a good framework for problem solving and decided to get this book. Content-wise the author has much to cover with 14 core diagrams. He has categorised all this 14 diagrams under several business themes such as: Managing Change, Control, Relationships, Managing Flow etc etc.     I really like the Influence Diagram as it provides a fresh perspective to a Strategic Project I handled before.    However the publisher seems to like really long paragraphs with little spacing. The published date is 2000 but I feel this style of writing was more to early 1800s where TV has yet to be invented.    Hope the author would try to upgrade and review the content with perhaps a different publisher. There is another similiar book of this nature which is the "The Thinker's Toolkit". Happy Diagramming 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 Have you noticed the symbol on the cover of the book? It is disguised cleverly. It is the mark of the beast 666. The same symbol as the Trilateral commission, and other organizations. Open your eyes people and see what you are reading.  This is a perfect example of the War between God and Satan.  Please study what this woman stands for before you read this book, so you will be more prepared to understad what is going on 
 If you're looking for the sound of the original recordings, look to a different CD. 
 ...because I do not think that is going to happen.  I have only NOT finished one other book in my life, but I really did not see any point in spending more time reading past the 3/4 mark of this guide.  I did try!    In all fairness to the author, I do not know what I really expected from this book.  I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try, though I am usually not one to seek instruction on undertakings as individually-tailored as travel.  I like the idea of "threading," but the idea hardly seems novel; one only has to travel once to understand that the journey is measured as much by the travel between destinations as in the places themselves.  Aside from this common ground, I find little of the author's advice useful.  If you are really going to be doing the kind of cultural trekking that the author describes, you would probably be best to think through your own plan instead and "situationalize" what could happen on your particular route and your plans.    This book may be good for someone who calls a one-week stay in a Las Vegas hotel a vacation.  Besides that, I see little difference between the wisened "threader" and the jet-bound traveller who only hits major cities in his/her travels - both are engaged in an experience of going and doing, in their own ways, and not so much about being in a place.  
 After 9/11 this book, this poet, is obsolete. Or "Never" mirrors the worst aspects of American culture-- a slovenly, self interested, ridiculously precious sense of being. It is embarrassing to read, frankly. Give me Kinnell, Merwin, Bishop. Poets with heart and compassion, poets who are alive in their poems. "Never" is deadening 
 I first bought Inis cologne in Ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time.  I will go to great lengths to find the cologne.  I am very glad it is now being offered by Amazon 
 Typical of recent multicultural efforts it is a book heavy on theory and unsupported assertions. Facts are only given when they support the multicultural agenda of the day. For example, in my reading of Chinese-American and European-American memoirs, I have found that relations are often shown as containing much more mutual respect than any multicultural historian will allow. This book also uses "whiteness" rhetoric--a substitute for substantive analysis. Every group is tribal to an extent--favoring their religious, ethnic or cultural group. Examples aboud in Asia, for example, but everytime any European-American favors themself it is "whiteness." China and Japan have over their long histories have practiced their own discimination, such as massacres or immigration restrictions on foreigners. We of course don't reduce all of Japan's history to a criticism of "Japaneseness." Euroamericans were worse, of course, but some of the actions called "whiteness" are just the same cultural self-preference everyone else is allowed 
 After reading so many chick books, I was really expecting something really good out of Carole Matthews, unfortunately I didn't. I thought she put way too much detail into everything, which seemed to drag everything too much. I got bored of all the detail, ad it didn't seem like she was focused on the story. There were no twist to this story it was just plain. I wouldn't recommend this book, and not to mention the last page was the worst.. Bad ending, bad book, period 
 There are some interesting positions, but some are not for humans. As for the Illistations, I'm going to get some Crayolas for it 
 I found it very difficult to follow the authors meaning throughout this book.  There seemed to be a great effort to include supporting scripture to back up her conclusions, although I found that often the scripture references had little or no relevance to the topic being discussed.  Many scriptures seem to be taken out of context and have been misinterpreted in an effort to support her views, many of which have nothing to do with animals.  This book is also filled with constant repetition, which I found very annoying to say the least.  One of numerous examples of this is her need to identically translate the same Hebrew and Greek words 3 or 4 times within the same 3 to 4 pages.   Her discriptions of vocally explaining heaven and souls directly to her cat in the belief that this will somehow offer her cat an "advantageous place" in heaven and include the cat in the "advanced class" in heaven were offensive.  In addition, she was unable to back this belief up with any Bible scriptures.  Overall, this book was very disappointing and not the least bit helpful.  Thankfully, I have since found several other very well written books by different authors that do a much better job of proving animals go to heaven, which has been a great blessing to me. 
 I purchased this item for my father for christmas. One day later is stopped working completely.  This product was sold thru amazon by Ritz Camera. It has now been three weeks since we contacted this company to either have the item replaced or refunded.  To date this still has not been rectified. I do not suggest that anyone by any product by this manufacturer or from this company.  In fact I think amazon should drop Ritz Camera completely.  Each time Ritz Camera is contacted they tell you it will be 24 to 48 hrs to process the refund or replacement.  Yeah we've been hearing that for three weeks now. Buy from them at your own risk. Thanks 
 I don't think this title can qualify as a guidebook. It feels like it was written in a big hurry. Using it we found big holes. The advice in it is dated and there were so many discrepancies we had to buy another guide mid-vacation. Then our vacation took a big turnaround for the better.       Maui is a real beautiful place for a family vacation if you know where to go. The traffic was pretty bad but there are certain tricks for getting around all that 
 To preface: I am a longtime fan of INXS and own everything from Listen Like Thieves to Elegantly Wasted. Elegantly Wasted is, in my opinion, almost worse than Full Moon, Dirty Hearts. Actually, I will definitively say it IS worse. There are the gems Show Me (Cherry Baby) and Elegantly Wasted, the title track, but the album quickly runs out of gas, runs together, and seems uniformly tepid, like lukewarm water. It doesn't rock the way INXS usually rocks. It attempts to experiment like some of the earlier projects successfully did, only unsuccessfully. There aren't the hooks or the tunes to redeem it. This is disappointing because I am a fan and I want to give the band an open ear and not condemn their work. But this album, unfortunately, stinks.  If you've ever seen INXS' Live Baby Live concert or listened to any album from 1985's Listen Like Thieves to 1992's Welcome to Wherever You Are, you probably concur that INXS was (and is, thanks to their newfound popularity with the Rockstar INXS TV show) a band capable of a great sound and a load of great songs. For instance, the entire playlist around 1991 was one great song after another. It was the pinnacle of the band's career. Michael's stage performance oozed with charisma and sexiness, Andrew's (and Michael's) songwriting was top notch, the band's arrangements were tight and good. And then something happened.  Fan reaction to X was much more tepid than to Kick, although X still sold fairly well. The band embarked on a successful tour. Around this time, grunge became huge in the global musical consciousness, and by the time of Welcome to Wherever You Are in 1992, the INXS sound was out-of-style. But ironically, that album contains some of the band's most diverse, greatest work.   INXS is releasing a new album soon with their new lead singer, J.D. I hope, and am confident, that it will be a return to greatness for the band. I believe that they can still crank out bitchin' tunes once again 
 I recently gave this movie another shot, at the request of a friend.  I was impressed, this time, with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography.  It's as if every scene could be a postcard, and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing.  And the songs are great, if a little "forced" into the movie.  Unfortunately, that's all there is, except beautiful Brad Rowe, totally wasted here in this nothing piece about self-indulgence and galling disregard for everyone that loves you (while pining away for what you obviously can't have.)  Add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others (Sean P. Hayes' character) while simply pursuing your own desires.  ("I want to be there for him.")  Right.  It's so artificial, it's about as convincing as plastic palm trees.    There are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers, but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long, heart-felt pauses of nothing.    Someone made this picture to fulfill their dream, and did a fine job of casting and cinematography.  There is little else to see here.  Even as a fluff piece, it's barely worth your time 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 Why? Because this book says nothing more than what he had already said in A Brief History of Time. However, I will say that unlike A Brief history of time, this one is a really, really big book with lots of colorful pictures so that they can charge an extra 30 dollars. And that he also changed the titles of the chapters. That's something...and the pictures were pretty!   Believe it or not after I read Universe in a Nutshell I decided to give good ol' Steve one more shot so I picked up A Theory of Everything. However, to my surprise, within those pages I didn't find a theory of everything...but I did find somehting that amazed me more than a theory of everything every could...Inside, I found A Brief History of Time! He had fooled me again!  It's a conspiracy, this man is publishing the same book over & over again with different titles to fool people into buying them. And he's including illustrations now because he discovered how well worthless pictures sell! Don't buy into it! It's a trick, underneath the new dustjacket, pretty pictures, and new chapter headings, these are same words!  I proclaim myself to be the first to say "I will not be fooled by Mr. Hawking again. 
 "The silence of the experts is part of a larger problem," Columbia University historian Rashid Khalidi laments in the introduction to his critique of American policy in the Middle East, taking policymakers to task for listening to "ill-informed pundits rather than people who are actually knowledgeable about the rest of the world."  Rather than demonstrating why academics should be consulted by policymakers, however, Resurrecting Empire is a case study of why they are not. Khalidi's book, which examines the record of Western involvement in the Middle East and analyzes the likely outcome of the most recent US incursions, rests on questionable sources, a tendency to favor polemic over fact and reflects little understanding of how policy is made.  In his historical analysis, Khalidi demonstrates little understanding of Iraqi history, failing to mention Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons on the Kurds and the draining of the marshes. Rather, he implies that Arabs think with one mind and hold the Israeli-Palestinian dispute central to their identity. But, after 35 years of Ba'athist dictatorship, Iraqis have a sense of historical exceptionalism.  Khalidi (who did no research in Iraq) instead transplants an Arab nationalist discourse into a society that has largely abandoned it. When UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi addressed Iraqis as "my fellow Arabs," they responded with stony silence. Iraqis have not forgotten that as undersecretary of the Arab League, Brahimi did not speak up as Saddam massacred tens of thousands of Arab Shi'ites.  If historians are trained to evaluate sources, then Khalidi is negligent, if not dishonest. For insight into policy development, for example, he cites Karen Kwiatkowski. She neither worked in the office of Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith nor was she involved in Iraq planning, as Khalidi implies. Rather, Kwiatkowski was the Morocco desk officer in the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary, several layers down. More troubling, Khalidi ignores Kwiatkowski's association with the conspiracy-prone Lyndon LaRouche organization.  Khalidi cites many speeches and reports in the course of his narrative. But, rather than access the original, he relies on secondhand interpretations by fringe Internet journalists. The result is repetition of bizarre (and anti-Semitic) conspiracies. He questions the loyalty of top administration officials, alleging falsely that they were advisers to former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Such allegations are inconsistent with the primary documents which focus on the American war on terror.  DISCUSSING POLICY, Khalidi throws away any pretext of research and relies instead on rhetoric. He condemns US unilateralism, dismissing the 49 countries which supported Iraq's liberation as the "Coalition of the Coerced." The same holds true in his narrative of Israeli-Palestinian relations. Khalidi cites statistics that count Hamas terrorists killed in firefights as civilian casualties. He laments the "mythology" of Oslo, and the "nursery fable" of prime minister Ehud Barak's "generous offer" at Camp David.  He repeats the canard that Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount sparked the Palestinian uprising, ignoring a string of statements by Palestinian officials to the contrary. In 1996, for example, then-Palestinian Authority Minister of Planning Nabil Shaath said that should Israel dismiss any Palestinian demands, "We will return to violence. But this time it will be with 30,000 armed Palestinian soldiers."  A month after the collapse of Camp David II, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Middein declared, "Violence is near and the Palestinian people are willing to sacrifice even 5,000 casualties." Palestinian terrorists killed an Israeli soldier the day before Sharon visited the Temple Mount.  Khalidi's lack of primary source research leads him down the path of flawed conclusions. Rather than interview Iraqis, Khalidi is dependent upon media reports. He implies that the one-in-six Iraqis who fled the country during the reign of Saddam lost their legitimacy within their families and among compatriots. Not only is this counterfactual, but such logic would also undercut Khalidi's own claim to insight in the contemporary Arab world.  Khalidi suggests a greater UN role, but ignores Iraq's unique history with that body. Had Khalidi done field work, Iraqis would have reminded him of Kofi Annan's February 24, 1998 press conference, in which the secretary-general said, "Can I trust Saddam Hussein? I think I can do business with him." In Iraq, these words have had special meaning since the Iraqi daily Al-Mada's exposure of UN oil-for-food program graft. To date, the UN cannot account for approximately $5 billion in oil-for-food money. Historically, Arab nations distrusted League of Nations mandates; the assumption that they would welcome a greater international role is based less in the realm of historical analysis than in Khalidi's own political beliefs.  Khalidi takes his Arab nationalism further, suggesting that Iraq's neighbors play a greater role in its fate. Assuming the Khalidi does not want to suggest Iranian or Turkish involvement (the former acceptable to no one, and the latter unacceptable to most Kurds), he underestimates the resentment with which Iraqis view other Arabs. Iraqis blame Kuwaitis for post-war looting. They label all Saudis as "al-Qaida." Their hatred toward Jordan, which they accuse of profiting from sanctions, is such that petrol station attendants refuse to fill Jordanian-plated cars. In 1999, the Jordanian director of UNICEF in northern Iraq replaced Swedish teachers with Palestinians from UNRWA. The local population protested. UNICEF had to reverse the decision because of the "psychological trauma" the presence of Palestinians caused among victims of chemical weapon attacks who had seen Iraqi state television footage of Palestinian demonstrations in support of Saddam Hussein.  On June 24, 1982, historian Bernard Lewis published a review of Orientalism, literary critic Edward Said's polemical work. Lewis's New York Review of Books article was devastating. He exposed numerous errors and omissions. That Khalidi dedicated this book to Said is appropriate. If Khalidi's analysis is meant to represent what academia can contribute to policy, then Resurrecting Empire is a damning indictment of academia today.   Jerusalem Post, July 15, 200 
 I love Italian exploitation, but this movie forgets to throw in the exploitation.  The worst Italian horror flick of all time?  Maybe, but then what about Evil Clutch.. 
 how many modern day jaws rip-offs do there need to be. Well! Okay this film i would rank lower than 2 stars if it wasn't for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist. The other reason was i think Casper Van Dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him. But this movie stunk. In no ways does it compare to jaws nor even Deep Blue Sea. I hated almost every moment of it. If you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy Deep Blue Sea. Or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years. Don't be fooled this is a waste of time and effort. This film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none. ... 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 This book's "scientifically proven" findings made me think it would contain something really life-changing or unheard-of. On the contrary, the book's advice couldn't be more cliched.  Niven never says anything of real depth or quality. You don't learn. Each chapter is too short. As a result, the topics are way underdeveloped. Another problem: some chapter titles just don't relate to the content that follows. One that stands out especially is, "Turn off the TV." So turning off the television is REALLY going to make me happier?! Niven's point might be that doing so translates to quality time spent with family, friends, or simply oneself, but why target just TV? When I read the title, I anticipated reading about studies showing that TV viewing leads to increased incidence of depression, but no, that's not it at all. The chapter really has nothing to do with TV. Other chapters are similarly problematic.  A far better book--MUCH better--is "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff," by Richard Carlson, a book that truly changed my outlook and approach to everyday problems, and for me that's saying A LOT. That book makes you think and constantly presents a perspective the reader might never have considered. 
 Indy comic writer/artist Paul Pope, best known for works such as THB and Heavy Liquid, takes us to Gotham City in the year 2039 for BATMAN YEAR 100, set... well... 100 years after the debut of the Golden Age Batman. The future ain't such a pretty place - instead of streamlined pop-art fanciness, we are presented with darkness and grime, and technology that, while advanced, doesn't make the future a sunny place. A federal agent is murdered in Gotham, and who should be caught on video at the scene of the crime than the Dark Knight. As all files and records on Batman appear to have been purged, he is regarded only as a mythological creature, rumor, fairy tale, symbol... anything but a real person. As Federal troops descend on the city to capture him, we learn that he's real enough, and what's more: the man behind the cowl might actually be Bruce Wayne!  This trade collects Pope's 4-issue miniseries, plus his "Berlin Batman" story from Batman Chronicles #11. Visually, this book is stunning. Love it or hate it, Pope's distinctive take on Batman cannot be ignored. It's gritty, jarring, even ugly, but it suits the style of the story, with a hint of classic Golden Age feel. There is an abundance of atmosphere, to the point that the pages almost have a "smell" or "sound" to them. Even though Pope's style may not be all that palatable in terms of what superhero fans are accustomed to, you can't help but feel the reality inherent in his Batman. He certainly seems more like an actual human being compared to what I've seen recently from other Batman artists.  Unfortunately, I'm not as keen on Pope's writing as I am on his art. While he does a good job creating a future setting for the story, Batman himself is not adequately addressed. The reader is certainly presented with some interesting situations. Is this really Batman? Where has he been? Why was his existence hidden? Is it really Bruce Wayne, and if so, how has he been alive for so long? The reader can make some educated guesses, but Pope puts forward nothing concrete. But my biggest question is this: as hints are dropped that this Batman could be the same one fans have read about for the past 60 years, what happened to all the other heroes and villains of the DC Universe? The story left me with far too many questions, and even the little ones I had going in weren't answered satisfactorily. While Pope succeeded at setting up a big mystery. I don't feel that this story was developed to the point that it had to exclusively be a "Batman" tale - realistically, any Golden Age DC hero could take Batman's place. I did have fun with the "Berlin Batman" story - an odd little piece, but very fitting considering the abundance of Jewish comic creators. I had certainly hoped for more from BATMAN: YEAR 100, given the reviews I'd read, but while the premise certainly hooked me, the story addressed none of the obvious questions. 
 The usual anti tradition garbage. Little biography here more of a thesis of liberal pope=good pope traditional pope=evil pope. Bad biography, any real church historian knows John XXIII never wanted the garbage that happend after vatican II i.e. he never even wanted a mass in the vernacular. If you like real catholicism and beauty ( or for that matter are looking for a bio of John xxiii) then skip this book, If you want a book about why churches should continue to look like empty garages and homilies should be given by a butch nun about how we need to call jesus she then this ones for you 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done 
 Fox uniquely attempts to give suggestions on how to keep the best employees. Fox divides his book into fifty short stories that sometimes include a real life situation.  Many of his anecdotes have serious flaws in the basic principles of Organizational Behavior, while others do not fully explain how to handle potential problems.   There are instances where his suggestions can be very useful in becoming a good manager.  At other times, his stories have good concepts, but do have loopholes.  If you were interested in only seeing a small picture of the steps to becoming a great manager, then I would recommend this book to you.   Fox's numerous weaknesses on motivation make me believe that he does not understand some of the basic concepts of motivation.   Furthermore, his continual discussion of avoiding mishires, without any description on how to do that, further weakens his arguments.   I believe this book is for more experienced managers and educated employees who know to extrapolate the good ideas in the book, and ignore the bad 
 The timing for the video content is off and doesn't match the music, the music is good and well-played but arranged to the point that whole movements that are originally 10 minutes long are only like 2 minutes in the video and we foud that frustrating since we listen to Beethoven un-arranged regularly. I also noticed that there was a lot of silent time in this particular video or times at which music is played but it isn't anything I've heard that was composed by Beethoven or, well, maybe it was but edited so to be simplified that it was no longer recognizable. My child may be only 6 mos but he recognizes good music when he hears it having been exposed to it from the time he was in the womb and since and this video didn't catch his interest at all. The BE Mozart music is good though so if you're looking for a video with good music do that one or the Wordsmouth...altogether, though, I recommend just buying the c.d.s and not the composer vids 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 Unfortunately, I checked out this book by reading only the blurb which, of course, presented a totally inaccurate picture.  Prof Wagnar may be excused for proletariat leanings since academia is the last refuge of true believers  still "waitin' for the Revolution".  (That is, if you don't count such vacation hot spots as North Korea, Vietnam or Cuba.)  It's not that the author was so wrong about the collapse of Marxist ideology - after all the CIA missed the boat - it's that he chose to assign moral, economic and political equivalence to the two worlds.    Anyone with an atom of sense knew, even in 1989, that the USSR was an economic disaster and falling fast, a third-world country bristling with nukes.  The spectacular collapsed revealed the extent of the rot in all its ugliness.   But what galled me was the lack of vision.  The "story" of technology was downright embarrassing, vague and semi sci-fi. His vision (quote unquote) was woefully inadequate.  Like many historians he became obsessed with political trends he sees or desires. Thus, we have the fall of capitalism, the spread of the Russian Empire, Marxism taken seriously fifty years from now (Russian-speak sounds like Lenin - LOL), the failure of SDI, the rise of Russia over China...needless to say, the exact opposite happened in every single case.    Some of the worst pleading concerned the various global governments he describes.  This is his real concern and goal - Earth uniting under one political banner.  For "balance" he makes a Latino, woman president start WWIII killing (he breezily reports) about 5.8 billion after which the world unites and does great things.  Obvious questions arise - with the technological heart cut out (the West and particularly the US) how does Africa or South America suddenly develop this great technology? The book ends quickly - we build big spaceships, roar to the stars and find evidence of "archeological discoveries" near the star Procyon.  Yeah, right. My grade - F-. 
 This book has some (okay, maybe even a lot of) un-funny jokes that don't make much sense (non-sequitar), but it has some good ones and my younger siblings enjoy reading it 
 Like Robert Zemsky at Penn, William Massey at Stanford, and Diane Oblinger and Anne-Lee Verville ("What Business Wants from Higher Education"), Lenington views higher education as simply one more business, an enterprise from which to squeeze dollars.  Colleges and universities are inefficient because, like state and federal agencies, they are not run as for-profit entities.  "To improve management of resources and realign the industry," we must start thinking of students as customers, degrees as products, and the public as "stakeholders."  Faculty?  They are simply labor and thus an expense to be contained.  As for the intellectual independence insured by tenure, it is does not make economic sense.  "Efficiency" and the bottom line dictate the use of academic minimum-wage earners (part-time, adjunct faculty)--disposable serfs who will do what they are told.  And, of course, higher education must become more competitive.  But in pushing the higher-education-as-business model, Lenington is advancing what logicians call a false analogy.  For one thing, students are both customers and products, a confusion that exists nowhere in the business world.  For another, even at private schools our students are heavily subsidized and thus are not paying their full way (and, of course, they suffer from a deficiency called ignorance that by its very nature means that they are not in a position to know what they need).  For yet another, education is largely a cooperative, not a competitive "enterprise."  That is why scholars eagerly share their findings in disciplinary journals and at regional and national conferences.  For Stanford to become a greater university, Berkeley need not deteriorate.  In fact, the findings of a Stanford prof can enhance instruction at Berkeley, and vice-versa.  Like other advocates of the business model, Lenington invokes an idealized image of corporate behavior.  What he does not acknowledge is the golden rule of business: To give customers as little as they are willing to accept in exchange for as much as they are willing to pay.  If we run higher education like a business, then, we must inevitably calculate how to teach our students as little as we can for as much tuition as we can extort.  The competitive pressure to produce better graduates?  By the standards of business, Stanford could outcompete Berkeley by educating its students half as well for a third of the cost.  As the McDonald's success story illustrates, there is more money in fast-food joints than in 4-star restaurants.  Thirty years ago a book like this would have evoked laughter or outrage, but no one would have taken it as a serious proposal.  Now, in an era when many upper-echelon administrators have degenerated into rsum-stuffers looking for their next career move, they no longer identify their interests with those of faculty and thus find the business model mighty attractive.  After all, it offers campus CEO's the prospect of greater power and more generous compensation packages.  As for the long-term health of American education, that is not an issue.  The business model is all about immediate, short-term profit 
 First, let's begin with the premise that the collaberation of, at one time, in one relative place, and with (seemingly) one goal, those who have come to be collectively known as the Founding Fathers was, by any accounts, an extraordinary period in the history of humanity.  A Dream Team, if you will.  Second, let's remind ourselves that none of these men were devoid of their flaws.  Many, in retrospect, carried their warts and blemishes with a sense of pride, if not prominence.  While it is inevitable, and not inappropriate to find an interest in these founders and their various achievements so timely and exciting centuries after they did what they did, it is also inevitable that the lines of truth and accuracy have faded in the interim, and an honest interpretation of events between 1750 and 1820 requires of the interpretor an open mind, and a lack of preconceived notions.  Ms. Appleby has not satisfied that requirement in her Jefferson interpretation.  Appleby admits in the opening paragraphs to be an admirer, and continues to clarify that point throughout the book.  She sets Jefferson apart from the other 'founders,' who are minimized, if not dismissed as having provided less,if any substance to the drive for that ultimate goal.  Indeed, Appleby seems to be saying that the goals of the various gentlemen involved were so varied as to be in direct opposition to each other.  Moreover, Appleby outrightly idolizes Jefferson.  Her platitudes do not, however, shine any more light on the man, who certainly qualifies as one of the more secretive/introspective of the bunch.  Instead, one is left the option of accepting Jefferson as a Moses-like character, or of choosing to look elsewhere for a more in depth assessment of this certainly great man.  Other reviewers have noted her attention to Jefferson's issues with slavery, with women, with indians.  These are discussed, but rather than in a way that would try to find a root cause, or to compare them with other frailties in his character, the effort seems to be to offer them as some offset to the bulk of the material, which is close to hero worship.  There is enough information about Jefferson, even considering the depths of his persona, to identify some (but certainly not all) of the demons that tormented the man.  And also enough information to know that Jefferson was not immune to crossing the lines of decorum that separate the common man from the political climber.  But you wont find that discussion here.  In the end, we have yet another portrait of this man, who deserves his place in the pantheon, but ther is no flesh, no blood, no heart.  Just canvas 
 I thought I remembered this as being a good movie when I was a kid. Upon seeing this movie again, some thirty-five years later; I was wrong. The acting is terrible and the story has more than a few technical flaws that really irked me. Such as the soldiers with no grenandes hanging from their web gear (they magically appear during the battle scenes), or only one BAR in the entire company, and no one wearing bandoleers of ammo for their M-1 rifles. And one of the biggest faux's was the use of German MP-40's (9mm subguns) by both the Americans and Japanese (In the Pacific War?).   A cheaply made movie (technically speaking) for only the psychological impact. I guess I'm just used to more realism than was displayed in this movie. If you've ever seen bad acting when a soldier is getting shot - a la "Hell Is For Heroes," then you're really going to laugh at the way guys die in this movie. Ugh! I'm donating my video to the local library.   
 This book would benefit from more hunting action (see Rita Mae Brown's Outfoxed for an example), and characters that are less wooden and featureless.  Snooty Bachelor Doug, Ice Queen Lawyer Anne (as a woman lawyer I am particularly sick of this sterotype), adorable, smarmy little girl add up to a snooze of a plot.  Even Doug's horses are devoid of personality.  If we can't warm up to the characters, at least give us some thrilling hunt action to enjoy 
 one of the last of the biblical epics, this was a bomb in its initial release, and deservedly so.  the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism, and most of the sequences (adam & eve, tower of babel) are either laughable or langorous (george c scott & ava gardner as abraham & sarah).  yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah, with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie: replete with the right mix of humor and awe.  that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd, but if you can catch it on tv some day, its worth a half hour of your life. 
 the beats are hot as fu*k but the singing is just terrible. the beats are crazy on this disc but t-pain cant sing for his life at all. you can tell his voice is all metallic on his songs. but two stars for the beats. the lyrics aren't very good either 
 I have read every novel in the Sharon McCone series and have them all in my collection.  When I found this book at Barnes and Noble and read the description I was giddy with anticipation.  I wanted to read about the relationship between Sharon and Hy as man and wife.  I was very disappointed.  The plot line is basic and good.  A daughter wants to find her mother who disappeared over twenty years ago.  Closure is all she wants although her sister would just as soon let it be.  Thus begins the chase all around the northern California coast, ending in Klamath Falls, Oregon.  Whew!  So little time was spent in San Francisco that the office people who I have come to know and adore, were virtually non-existent.  Most of the conversation is stilted and the majority is done over the telephone.  The cell phone being turned off is a recurring distraction.  Is this supposed to have an allegorical meaning?  I don't know.  Sharon's adopted mother and biological mother rate a paragraph or two in the novel.  Hy appears once or twice and I highly doubt that a newly married man would allow his wife to be so distant from him.  Irregardless of their "evolved" relationship, I think it was cold on Sharon's part to proceed on her own when she has such available talent at the home office, just waiting for such an assignment.    My main complaint about this novel is there are two many one-dimensional characters.  I got so confused as to who was who and how they were relevant to the story.  I never got to "know" them and motivations were sometimes so closeted I was in the dark.  There was a very good potential plot in the Mark Aldin/Ricky relationship and yet it was briefly dealt with in sentences.  His death was related by phone call.  (again, the phone)    Hence the title of my review, the point vanished.  I was bored reading the book and just was not interested nor did I particularly care what happened to Laurel Greenwood.  I don't think she was intelligent enough to do what she did and I do not think she was an artist.  I will read the next book in the series and if it presents the same types of problems for me, I will probably give up reading them as I gave up on VI Warshawski years ago.  When you don't like the main character, no point in reading the novel 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 I have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together!  I have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter's other contraptions.  I guess I'll have to sic my husband on it 
 While I give the book kudos, I'd veer away from the school itself. I went to the school after calling them saying I'd love to work there only to find out they weren't hiring (lied on the phone) and to work there I needed to take *all* the classes. They had me on one couch and three other women telling me to give them money. Trying to like push me into whipping out my check book and take classes.  I think it's nice to help women see the light, but not push them into paying an arm and a leg.  Seriously, they ask for five thousand dollars to take their classes. Buy the book, get some healthy friends that are open about love and learning and do it for free 
 Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be 
 If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and "maybe" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd 
 I found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories. the dates and names are wrong..needless to say i was dissapointed 
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 this book was not the best. Some parts where exciting, but most of the book was boring. I would not recamend this to a younger kid because it has some big words.  
 Trefil's ideology got in the way of his using his common sense.   To make a long story short, Trefil writes that scientists can manipulate eggs, in order to cause them to develop into embryos.  Therefore, all eggs are embryos.  There is a BIG difference between a manipulated egg and an unmanipulated egg...just as there is a BIG difference between a fertilized egg and an unfertilized egg.  Trefil says the fact that this manipulation of eggs is possible, implies that pro-life women who shed unfertilized eggs each month should be concerned that they are actually having abortions.   Weird idea? You bet.  Don't forget to put on your "thinking cap" when you enter Trefil's world of science fiction. 
 I was a fan of House(the first of the series) and so purchased the combo DVD set of House and House 2.  I watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while House is pretty good, House 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on.  It is really quite dumb, but some of the creatures(i.e. "catter-dog" as I like to call him) are kind of fun to see.  I would suggest skipping the second House unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be;- 
 This book didn't do it for me. It has a lot of overview, theory, selective details and glancing personal accounts--but all of it in a tone of an infomercial. The problem is that this way of approaching any subject rarely gets people to achieve the goals that Pink urges us on to. Instead, it continues an ongoing addiction to self-help books which may be the next silver bullet to our woes. . . but most often it's not.  He takes a broad survey of a lot of fields, grabs bits of information and formulates it into theories about being a free agent. Having been a grunt-work temp, a freelancer, and now a homeschooling mom (free-agent education), the descriptions seem less-than-rigorous and his conclusions are overdone. Zeal is a powerful force and Pink has lots of it. But it's a force that hasn't matured and mellowed into evenhanded understandings which are brought by in-the-trenches personal experience. And that is what a lot of us need to join the free-agent world 
 I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.   I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.  I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly 
 Unless you are doing graduate-level work on the Weimar era (which I am), stay far away from this book as an intro.  It is not for the timid reader.  I'm trying to get my hands on the original German edition, but whether it is the writing or the translation, Peukert's book reads as if it were authored by the illegitimate, illiterate love-child of James Joyce and Henry James. Contentwise, it has very little to do with the popular perception of "Weimar Culture;" for that, check out Peter Gay.  This book deals primarily with social and economic conditions, and hardly ever mentions politics, and even more rarely, art.  If you like charts and graphs and figures though, this is full of them.  That said, this is the preeminent book on Weimar Germany.  It helps to have a philosophy degree to read it, though.  Anthony Heilbut's excellent Exiles in Paradise is more than worth checking out if you're interested in the mass emigration of German artists and intellectuals to the US 
 Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 Though the recipies in this book sound delicious this book is far from written for dummies as it claims. Being a beginning cook I find it hard to follow what would seem to be the basic instruction for each recipe. I get lost figuring out just how to cut an onion "coursely" as I've never done it before. There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?) This book is obviously written for someone who has basic knowledge of cooking and its very frustrating to read. The instructions are too vague for beginners and the descriptions of techniques leave me wondering what the author is talking about. Not to mention each recipe expects that you have an entire kitchen full of gadgets at your disposal to prepare these fancy dishes. I think I'm going to have to find a different book to teach me to cook before I can dive into "Cooking for Dummies" and understand whats going on. Look for a different book! 
 Some nice ideas in a book with far too many pages. This story could be told in an article (OK, I'll admit a lenghty one), but it doesn't need a whole book to tell. And, although the ideas are nice, they are certainly not essential and they could be traded in for other equally good ideas on user-experience (imho 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 I ordered this book because I am extremely interested in the untold stories of the Partition of India even though the reviews told me not to.  I wished I had heeded the advice.  The book is incredibly repetitive--to the point of being unreadable. I learned very little.  Not worth the time to read or money to purchase.  
 How this book ever made it to print is beyond me. Not one single recipe in it works...not one. It was a monumental waste of money and effort. Disappointing 
 I think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones 
 This book is entirely too violent for ages 4-8.  While the illustrations are good, the text has various references to torture and killing.  It may be factually accurate as to the life of a pirate, but its too much reality  for young children 
 This is a book for kids who really are on the verge of making friends.  Who, in reality, probably wouldn't have that much trouble making friends with just a LITTLE bit of effort.  Unfortunately, my son isn't one of those kids.  He is ADHD with learning and speech difficulties.  The kids in his class have pretty much decided that he isn't for them.  If he was to ask one of them to come over his house, they would probably say no.  Why wasn't that covered in the book?  This book is far to simplistic for kids who have real problems making friends 
  It's hard to explain exactly how horrible I think the female heroine was written in this book.  I can not believe any female would ever act as she had in her position.  This heroine had no brain in her head.  She got turned on by a trespasser rubbing himself up against a window naked yet thinking about how he was such a disgusting pervert.   Understanding that this girl only has a quarter of a brain in her head but to not call the police even though she thought about it was idiotic and that includes her thinking she was safer with her carrying the sword and then blaming someone else for her killing a person.  This heroine had a mentality of a 12 year old.  I'm normally a fan of Richard Laymon's books but this is one I definitely could have done with out.  The two books I have read where he has female heroines have just been horrible 
 I saw a documentary on "Hank" Bukowski, and thought I'd give him a day in court. This was the only work of his available at the library, so this is what I sampled. It's crap. A waste of time. Bukowski's reputation certainly can't rest on this alone. Did he pull an esoteric fast-one, and write this just for the initiated? Maybe. The book still sucks 
 This is a dumb boring movie. I actually think this movie would be better to watch in 2d than 3d. The 3d in this movie sucks badly, and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting, direction, characters, and storyline-- one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for 3d scenes that simply do not deliver.   If you are looking for good 3d--PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. THESE "REVIEWERS" WHO REVIEW THIS MOVIE EITHER HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH THE STUDIO THAT RELEASED IT OR SIMPLY HAVE NOT REALLY EXPERIENCED ANY GOOD 3D MOVIES AND ARE JUST REVIEWING OUT OF IGNORANCE.   The field sequential in this movie is horrible, due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place indoors- inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field!! I dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential......if there is no depth to the picture...then there is no REAL 3D!  If you are looking for BEYOND EXCELLENT 3d, then get yourself a copy of "Alien Adventure", "Encounter in the Third Dimension", or "The Haunted Castle". I have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile.....  I love horror, I love 3D, and I love cult and B movies but this movie just could NOT hold my interest for long.  I have stopped and started it 3 times since I have received it, and have yet to finish the end of the movie.   Again.....maybe in 2d--but stay away from the lousy 3D version.  It downright sucks 
 Bought the isqueez along with the Brookstone Protection Plan on Feb 13, 2007 and it nearly crushed my foot on April 24th, 2007 and then it totally stopped working (just makes a grinding noise).  Called the toll free number for the Protection Plan and they said the item is still under manufacter's warranty and that I'll have to call Osim.  Called Osim's toll free number and they said I'll have to pay packing & shipping to return it for replacement.  Very unfair in my opinion as they should send a pre-paid UPS or FedEx label for return of their defective product.  Called the Brookstone store at Lenox Square in Atlanta where I bought it and the manager said to call Brookstone's toll free customer care line.  Called the customer care line and Kelly there told me Osim and Brookstone are one- and the same company.  She said it is their policy to have the customer pay for return shipping for defective products.  I will never buy from Brookstone again.  Their Protection Plan is a sham, their products are defective, and they don't care about their customers 
 First of all, I think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money. I would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators. The question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of Islam? Why today Middle East is the target by the oppressors of the New World Order? Who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring Democracy to a muslim world. What would happen if Islamic constitution would establish in western world. It would be a scary scene for that part of the world. Those who are muslims or studied Islam knows that it is a religion of PEACE. The word JIHAD in Islam corresponds to fighting against the DEVIL who resides within all of us which is 90% of JIHAD and the other 10% of JIHAD is self defence. There is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators. Comon people lets not have a religious war, we are all the children of ADAM and beleive in ONE GOD. Let us all join together to fight the DEVIL who is here to destroy each individual of us. We must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of DEVIL are doing to bring ONE WORLD ORDER and to enslave us under the DEVIL government. Peace to you all 
 My tape cassette reads, "Updated for the 90's." Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website 
 I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries). It is such a great concept, but unfortunately is very poorly made. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life. 
 I don't really know what this live album is supposed to accomplish, but I believe it has failed on all accounts. I enjoy having a live Tupac document, but the replay value is almost nil, as the sound quality is terrible.  All in all, I was fairly disappointed with this release 
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 I like most of it but at times it was hard to fully understand. I am going to read it again and I hope to better gain more of it the second tie around 
 I bought this book and the Oracle Press book "Oracle9i JDBC Programming" which covers similar material. The "Oracle9i JDBC Programming" book is much better 
 I ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen.  The English speaking voice has a British accent and is difficult to understand.  The scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable, especially for someone with impaired eyesight 
 although there is an intense void in the subject of trans and gender queer writings this book does little to fill it.  there are occational glimering voices of truth and clarity most notably the essay by the transman with MS, but overall there was too much youthful exuberance and not enough thoughful, mature writing.  i would much rather read a personal account of someone's reality than someone perched on a soapbox telling about how they live outside the gender binary.  although i believe gender is something worth deconstructing, to not acknowledge that it exists in this world, or to say you live outside of it without giving examples of how you make this possible shows to me a lack of maturity on the part of the writer.    I know mr. diamond to be a very prolific artist, but in this case i simply felt the quality was lacking.  
 I gave this toaster a 2 star rating because it does look great, which bumped it from one star.  However, from day one all it does is burn anything that goes into it, even at it's lowest setting.  Nice bagel setting but it too burns the one side to a crisp.  Not worth the money and I'm embarrassed I spent so much on a toaster thinking the DeLonghi name was worth it.  It wasn't.  Going back to a $20 toaster.... 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this 
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 Okay, this album is terrible. I mean, when you listen to stuff like Use Your Fingers and Hooray For Boobies (One Fierce Beer Coaster also wasn't great, but I certainly liked it better than Hefty Fine) and then play Hefty Fine, it makes you want to throw it at the wall. Gone are the pop culture references and guitar-laden riffs of the good old days. Now, basically the whole album is about having sex (which I wouldn't really mind if the innuendos were more clever) and the music is so electronically mixed that you honestly start to wonder whether they really used any instruments or whether Jimmy Pop Ali honestly sang a note.  The hidden track was disappointing, compared to the hidden tracks on their other albums, and the fact that Ville Valo sang on Something Diabolical just makes it worse.  Basically, I see this album as a last-ditch attempt to acquire some quick cash and I think the guys were getting a bit desperate.  Not to say that I still don't love Bloodhound Gang, I just think they could've done way better.  Track by track analysis? I think so.  Strictly For The Tardcore- 3/5. Funny but not particularly witty. Balls Out- 0/5. Completely terrible track. Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo- 4/5. Innuendos are great but music could've been better. I'm The Least You Could Do- 2/5. Farting With A Walkman On- 2/5. Diarrhea Runs In The Family- 5/5. Possibly the best track on the whole album. Ralph Wiggum- 4/5. I like the idea for the song, but the tune is flat and depressing. Something Diabolical- Negative 5/5. Completely awful song, and Ville Valo doesn't help it any.  Overheard In A WaWa Parking Lot- 4/5 only because it made me laugh. Pennsylvania- 4/5. Great track. Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss- 4/5. Also great. No Hard Feelings- 0/5. The whole song is pretty much one line OVER and OVER. Hidden Track- 1/5. COME ON, BAM MARGERA?!  All in all, this album was a huge letdown and I think Bloodhound Gang needs to step it up the next time around 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 Unfortunately, many so-called "rock journalists" are nothing more than sociology majors who let their devotion to an artists or group cloud their vision of unbiased criticism.  In this case, we get a bit of that from the contributing writers as well as a bias toward progressive "rock," which is in most cases nothing more than classical music composer wannabees who don't want to miss out on the fabled rock lifestyle.  Perhaps "Understanding Irrevalent Prog Rock" would have been a better title. And why would anyone analyze a four-minute song in 20 pages?  Does any true rock song need more than a couple of paragraphs?  This ain't Mahler, y'know 
 She entertwines the harsh and the gentle with grace. Forgotten creatures found through a maze so common in real life.I have read all her books, and though this is not one of my most favored, she still manages to sweep me away with the emotions of the charecters, and the magic displayed once again. Well worth the read 
 I used this ball with exercise video 4 times.  On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole.   
 The only discipline lacking in this story, is the author's 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English.  I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done.  Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much.  I still feel that it is of very little value.  Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed.  It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it.  The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work.  Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda.  Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped.  I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative.  
 If you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. It blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.  example 1. The problem of evil is solved thus: "And God has done something about the problem of evil. He has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his Son to die for evil men."  example 2. To John Wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: "For in Christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving Gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the Gardener into the human scene in the person of Christ (cf. John 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of His resurrection."   All of the arguments assume the ignorant position. The argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. Reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. Too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. I'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge.  
 This is the first 3rd edition D&D supplement for the forgotten realms that isn't any good... the quality of the other products just didn't make it into this one and that is very disappointing.  This book is almost 200 pages but you wouldn't know it by paging through it, it just doesn't seem to have any real content.  Yeah, there's feats and magic items but oddly enough it lacks info on the Underdark itself, it's almost like the book tried to be too many things to too many people.  I tried hard to like this book but just couldn't do it.  I'm sorry to have to say I don't recommend anyone buying it 
 This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.     The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.   
 I bought this book to see what is the fuss is all about, this book claimed "Matering Astral Projection".  But I wonder if the author clearly knowing what is astral projection.  Read more other books, then you will be able to tell the difference. Mr Bruce has never seen another other beings or even divine beings during astral projections, this is well known abilities in astral projection filed, but he got none of these skills.  Sorry, this book is failure.  Do not waste your money on this book 
 I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW  
 I found the book to have basic common sense information, no real ideas! It was one of 3 books that I purchased and I ended up returning the book and keeping the other 2 books. But, if you need help with how to get organized,  this is the book for you! The cover and title are misleading 
 Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer 
 Hey, who spilled orchestra all over my early Yes?  So apparently somebody in the Yes camp decided that the band just wasn't substantive enough as a self-contained unit, and that what it needed to really take off was a generous slathering of strings, in order to...geez, I dunno, certainly not to bring out the rockin' side of the band. After all, everybody knows that what rock 'n' roll really needs to become an artistically valid musical form is classical music, right? (And then Emerson, Lake & Palmer came up with the even MORE brilliant postulate that what classical music really needed to make it respectable was rock 'n' roll. Prats.)  And well...the result is weepy twaddle like the all-orchestral "Clear Days" or fruity arrangements of otherwise decent songs like "Then," which have all the subtlety of a nail-studded plank to the forehead. (Even worse, the orchestral call-and-response figure on the verses of "Then" is out of synch with the band by a few milliseconds, something which is - trust me -  quite noticeable and extremely grating).   On the other hand, I will grant that the orchestrations, for all of their utter garishness (in fact, because of them) work on "No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed." Although I'm not familiar with the original, I'll eat my watch if it's 1/10 as exciting as this version, which is splendidly overwrought in the same tradition as their covers of "Every Little Thing" and "Something's Coming," and an attention-grabbing way to open the album. I remember hearing this song for the first time, on the old Yesyears boxed set: Tony Kaye fires up that great crusty late-Sixties organ, and then out of blue comes...the STRINGS! Garish, silly strings, ostentatious violins, brass flourishes and all of it pushed up in the mix, flailing around wildly, so unsubtle as to be charming.  So I'm listening to this circus unfold, thinking exactly the following words: "Cripes, I'm expecting 'How The West Was Won' to break out any minute here."   And then it did.  No really, it does. The band tumbles into the instrumental break, Banks takes a muted guitar solo, and then suddenly it's Western Movie Night at the prog cinema in another one of those great early Yes moments that they just plain ol' forgot how to do later in their career.  I also enjoy the puppy-eyed "Sweet Dreams" and the Peter Banks how-do-ya-do of "Astral Traveller," but frankly Time And A Word suffers in comparison to either its predecessor or what would follow. There's simply too much tripe like "Clear Days" and "The Prophet," to say nothing of the thoroughly childish "Time And A Word," which ruins a decent melody and a winner of a bass line with moron-simple lyrics (answer to title quiz: "now" and "love.") and orchestration that fails to do anything except accentuate their emptiness. After this album was recorded, the band got tetchy and dropped Pete Banks.  It's hard to say that Steve Howe's arrival didn't take the group on to bigger and better things, given the weakness of half of this album (my rating would be 2.5 stars if I could do it), but I miss this era of the group nevertheless 
 The refrain "it's not about Bowie" may be true in a way; but watching the dvd and then reading the reviews below, it's clear why a lot of real Bowie haters seem to love this picture. The sneering review entitled "Citizen Bowie", for example, refers to him this way: "...lots of mediocre songs...even Ziggy had its clunkers...eventually the artist must stop living the myth and do the work."  Oh really?  I just read Cameron Crowe's article ("All Access Bowie") covering Bowie's pre-1976 period in the special 1000th issue of Rolling Stone and the man was described as a brilliant and hypercharged workaholic.  Hearing his albums in the very early seventies on underground FM radio, it cannot be overstated: Bowie was first and foremost a musical phenomenon - not a visual one.  We were blown away that the same person could write such widely diverse and highly acclaimed material as lp's like Man of Words Man of Music, The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust, and Aladdin Sane. In fact, most people- especially in America- who liked him in the earliest period did so in spite of (not because of) the androgony and "glam" context.  You have to be pretty thick not to see Slade as the Bowie character; this movie feels like a vendetta against Slade/Bowie even though clearly the main characters all have aspects that are composites. There are some who have written that film director Haynes' anger is attributable to the fact that Bowie did not allow his music  to be used in this mess of a movie. This seems plausible, but what is most telling is that the untalented and vengeful Angela Bowie loved it. This film has its moments visually, but is mostly way off the mark. 
 The Promise Ring are from my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I really wanted to give this disc a higher rating for that reason alone! However, this disc does not quite cut it for me. I own it, but rarely listen to it. In order to enjoy it I have to be in just the right sort of mood; one that craves rather disjointed music that doesn't really rise and fall at all, but just is. This is not a bad album. This is not a great album. It just sort of is. The first track is decent, but it does not go anywhere. The rest are rather forgetable. They all kind of run together. I enjoy some emo, but as others have said, I don't really care too much for the lead vocalist. Again, he's not bad, he's not great. He just sort of exists and drones in the same manner on all tracks. I remain curious about "30 degrees everywhere". Perhaps that is a better disc. Hit and (mostly) miss.  I might recommend checking out the little heard, now-defunct band BLOOMSDAY as an alternative to this album 
 I bought the shark with hopes that it would save my kitchen and bathroom from hard to reach grime and stains that wouldn't come off any other way. It was sadly only a mediocre help to my housework. The shark does a good job of removing the grime that lives around faucet handles and in the jam of the refrigerator, but I found it totally useless when trying to clean the stove, or any expanse of tiles that was more than three or four inches. The process of cleaning takes so long, a person would go mad before they cleaned all of the tiles in the bathroom! I was thrilled to buy this product, but it didn't live up to my hopes and dreams 
 I am a fan of vampire movies and collect them, from humorous to frightening.  This movie was a let down.  This was exactly what I would expect to find in a bargain bin, but definitely not at the price it is offered here.  I am, also, a Nicolas Cage fan.  I collect movies he stars in and so far, until this movie arrived, I can't say that I was ever let down by one of them.  To say this was a bit bizzare is an understatement.  You never really know if he is just crazy and imaging things or if it is really happening to him.  It is hokie to the point of not being humorous, just very bad.  My daughter loves hokie and even she walked out the room even though I suffered until the end.  I bought this based on the fact that it is a vampire movie and Nicolas Cage stars in it.  Even the trailer for this movie had to be edited in a way to make it sound interesting.  If you watch it, you will notice how scenes were taken out of content to make it look better than it really was.  Throughout the movie, Nicholas Cage had an on again off again accent that sounded like it was suppose to be British.  Word of advice, don't waste your money 
 I moved out to LA from NY and there is considerable less amount of humidity in LA.  My skin was drying up. So I asked and was recommended this humidifier. Unfortunately it did nothing to alleviate my dry skin. I blasted it on high and still nothing.  The filter seems to run out pretty quickly. The product seems very fragile. The material is cheap and the water tank doesn't fit properly into the product, so that moving it even it a little causes water to leak.  The plus side was that it was easy to assemble and it was cheap 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 I was so excited to read this book that I actually waitlisted myself at my university's bookstore.  What a let down. Perhaps after the Rushdies and the Roys and all the other highly literate Indian authors I've just discovered, my hopes were just too high.  Shiva Dancing, had a wonderful title, and that is the best thing I have to say about it.  The romance (and I normally adore romances) was tiresome, the main character was a little too fond of her red sari, and had little to no respect for, or even knowledge of, India or Indian culture.  Perhaps Ms. Kirchner should stick to the kitchen 
 While the class I took that used this textbook was informative, this book was full of what seemed to be the authors' personal opinons.  Like another person said here in the reviews about blame on the Bush administration, and lack of references aside from photo credits, this book seemed to be geared more towards giving you the biased outlook of the author than an unbiased view of environmental science.  I agree that this book is not fit for a college textbook, or any other type of education 
 I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.  One San Francisco reviewer even claimed "We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like." According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although "billions of people" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.  But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.  Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens "over there" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.   But what would the "ban DDT no matter what the cost" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue "we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?  Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about "long term damage to the environment" and "resistance to insecticide" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.  And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world "we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day. 
 When you call your book true stories, especially in this year of heightened awareness about what is truth and what is fiction, you should expect a higher level of scrutiny from your readers.  As such, I have to admit that I'm highly dubious as to the legitimacy and honesty of some of these stories.  I'm sure that they are all based on some grain of truth, but the specter of exaggeration lurks in the background of many of the stories.  Am I to really believe that people were punching him in the kidneys because he was walking around Seattle in a dog suit?  The height to which the story goes on-and-on seems like a rant.  Other stories also come across as rants.  The writing workshop story comes across as being written by someone with a big chip on their shoulder, a frustrated writer, and comes across and quite demeaning actually.    Many of the stories are down right obnoxious and boring.  Some are interesting as a brief diversion perhaps before bedtime.  Bottom line, I'm not sure if it was the attack on Seattle, or the underlying obnoxiousness and seeming exaggeration, but I found myself hating this book and hating its author 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 Another abysmal reprint of mind numbing market lore from days gone by. Not worth the time to open. Read Gustave le Bon and learn something useful. Line the birdcage with this 
 i don't why anybody liked this book. the story line wasn't bad it was just that is was way to vague and not enough interaction with the characters. i mean there is hardly any conversation at all 
 This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach! Brigham & Company will take 30 pages to explain a concept that can be done in 2 pages. I used this book for my finance class for my MBA; this one is not worth the money or your time. 
 after 20+ years of relapse/remision I'm at a point where many things are much harder.  The tone and attitude were wonderful. The basic weights and exercises were standard but the MS specialized like how to stand up were unclear and not well illustrated... 
 First of all I'm upset that I didn't have an option of awarding this disaster zero stars.  But that's another story.  I must be old-fashioned because in my day most vocalists could carry a tune and if they had instruments could play them at the very least with some degree of mediocrity.  The Raincoats are a total mess from the first note and beyond. Anyone who could give this music 5 stars must be brain dead.  I suspect that it's probably fashionable to jump on the bandwagon for a band (and I use the word very loosely) with absolutely no talent.  Getting a root canal with a pneumatic drill would be more entertaining.  Anyone buying this CD should be subject to intense psychotherapy.    
 This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids.  All the characters are presented as totally one-dimensional cliches-- business leaders who refuse to lose, tough-acting butchy women with hearts of gold-- all your favorites are here! You're forced to read page after page of detailed conversations that are clearly fictionalized.  The author bends over backwards in an effort to elevate Bass and Wells to superhero status.  All of this can get very annoying!  The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of.  By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story 
 Although this is the best rivalry in sports, it has been one-sided over the years. So, I think they went overboard covering the one real success the Red Sox have had--2004. Seems like half the video was about that one series.   Would've liked to have seen more coverage prior to 1996. Got glimpses of the 70's, including the '78 Playoff, but that was about it. Even footage of exciting in-season games would've been great 
 Just finished this book last night. Skipped large chuncks of it, as the only reason I was trying to even finish the thing is to find out what it was that happened 15 years ago.  I got this book as part of a giftbag at a Shecky's NYC event, and it took me a while to get to the book. Unfortunately, it's not realy well written, and the plot is sort of contrived (hence, the vast skipping of whole passages). The whole book revolves around some mysterious thing that happened 15 years ago and is surrounded by chunks and bits of events leading up to it, but with no real value.   While I appreciate Ms. O'Connor's effort at writing, for her first work she just doesn't quite pull through. The characters - while pretty well developed - were not entirely interesting and didn't conjure empathy from me. They were just a bunch of "messed up" girls due to "messed up" parents, suffering some "messed up" situations, and that's what the entire book goes on and on about.  Ms. O'Connor definitely has the potential to pull together something much better in her future work, but her writing style, use of analogies and similies, and descriptiveness, are all rudimentary still. It seems like she tried to add some shock and titillary value to the book by all the sex scenes, but that easily reduces it to the same levels of your average romance novel plus noir.  Anyway, the only thing I really liked about it was the Bay Area setting for one of the characters, because each mention conjured up happy memories for me 
 No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.  Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore. 
 Another reviewer wrote that this album is great "massage music" and is therefore compatible with a state of relaxation.  And I sadly have to agree! If you're looking for energetic and rousing battle songs that testify to the courage of the ancient Scots, you're definitely NOT going to find it here.  These songs are utterly lacking in energy and inspiration.  It seems the New Age movement has emasculated even our proudest memories of ancient courage and valor.  This album is an insult to the memory of the brave kinsmen who struggled against many worthy adversaries to achieve dignity and freedom.  The lyrics reflect little more than self pity, and the music could not stand alone without the vocals as most of the "songs" do not even have a strong melody by themselves.  I was expecting some rousing music such as that found in the old tune called "Men of Harlech", a famous Welsh song that has been rewritten time and time again to inspire Her Majesty's warriors on to battle, as in the movie "Zulu", for example.  So if you want some bland bedtime music buy this album, but if you want to be inspired with the glories of Scotland, look elsewhere 
 This is a book that offers zero new insights! What's worse... there are a lot of bold statements in this book, that I don't share. The authors have forgotten to share the evidence for these statements, so I can not take them very seriously 
 Having seen Dead Man Walking, I became interested in seeing more movies about the death penalty so I got a hold of this movie.... I hated it.  The acting was corny and cheesy.  Sean Penn's performance as a condemned  prisoner facing imminent execution was vastly superior and definitely more  convincing than Sharon Stone's.  It beats me why this movie was released  shortly after Dead Man Walking.  In fact, it beats me why it was released  at all.  Stick to Dead Man....don't bother with this extremely lame ripoff 
 I am so disappointed i cried!  i know most of the players in this book and not only was the storyline awful there are a great many untruths!  save your money and borrow one if you must read it.....ugggggggggggggg please my 5 year old son could do a better job!  I love reading true crime books and no i don't think i ever want to read another, by this author at least....j 
 I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. "Okay" I thought, "I must have got the one bad one..." So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the "radio stations" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are "just not tuned in right" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the "station fuzz" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage 
 I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.  
 I played my official soundtrack CDs to death so I was looking for a replacement.  This is not the real thing. A lot of the tracks aren't even on these, and the order on the rest of them is all mixed up.  Bad quality sound, without the energy and passion of the original -- sounds like elevator music.  There are even misspellings throughout the playlists.  It is not readily obvious to the buyer that it isn't what you think it is, until it arrives.    The Fellowship volume won't play on one of my hard drives at all; it plays, but fuzzily, on my laptop.  I gave up before trying it in the CD player in my vehicle.  
      Pavel wrote a precursor to this book which he admitted wasn't "user friendly." (a ridiculous euphamism on his part) His first book contained the following: several drills that were basically useless including his version of chest stretches, rocking the head from side to side, and simply reaching for the ceiling on tip-toes. also, there were drills that were already well known and done in high school gym classes all over america like toe touching, standing and bending to the side while reaching overhead and the common split. Lastly, he incorporated what he called shutdown threshold isometrics. now that i'm attending school to become a  physical therapist assistant i've come to discover that this maneuver is nothing new to the stretching/physical rehab world and is occasionally just given a new name by a fitness instructor to make it seem like they know something that most don't.      Now, how exactly does his newer book differ? IT DOESN'T! well, in all fairness he doesn't use the term shutdown threshold isometrics anymore, but still teaches the same exercise. and he did get rid of some of the completely obsolete exercises from the first book, but most of the exercises are exactly the same, just rehashed with different names like "the jackknife" if i remember correctly. If you are a complete beginner to stretching, then by all means read a book on fitness and stretching, but don't spend over 20 dollars for a book that is comprised of "nothing new" methods and several pages of advertisements of other pavel/dragondoor products! Or better yet, try a public library. remember though that just because pavel uses references to russian special forces training and denounces certain "overused" american training methods doesn't mean that he's offering you something new and exotic. In fact it's just rehashed info 
 "He was cringing, fighting the straps with amazing strength. His hands turned red and then white and the cords of the neck stood out like steel bands. The force of the electrical current was so powerful that his eyeballs popped out and rested on cheeks.  Finally, he caught the fire. His brain was boiling."  Shocking?  This is the description of the sufferings of prisoner being electrocuted.  In U.S.A.  In XXI century.  Taken out of context - what does it say about Americans?  Is that a true picture?  
 I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much 
 I purchased this book in hopes to have a reference guide for Iptables/Netfilter or even CheckPoint, but was sadly misled. The book covers only theory of how to build a firewall, while sighting no practical examples. It covers protocols, ports, and common types of security threats, but again gives no practical examples of how to write chains, tables or rules to prevent these attacks. If your a newbie to system administration you will learn quite a bit from this book, but if your a system admin such as I am looking for a reference guide THIS IS NOT I 
 Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.  Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.  Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.  Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.  
 Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films..."Color Purple" , "For Colored Girls...." etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we "work together"...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen.. 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 As an arcaheology student studying vernacular architecture, I found this particular text to be a waste of time. It does nothing for the history of architecture, nor does it lend itself to coherent reading 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 It's rather amazing how many five star "reviewers" have so much of the same bad information to impart about John Kerry, but so little to say about the substance of this book.   Rather than recycle chatroom effluvia, I will actually review the book:   Poorly researched, poorly written. Nasty, vindictive, and dishonest from start to finish.   For example, in describing his 1971 debate with Kerry on the Dick Cavett show, John O'Neill not only misrepresents what Kerry and Cavett said, and the audience's response, he actually misquotes HIMSELF. As the transcript (and video) of the debate is posted at O'Neill's own website, how hard would it have been to check for basic accuracy?   And why tell such easily proven lies, like claiming Kerry was booed during the debate, when the video clearly shows that he wasn't?   If you watch, you will also see O'Neill repeat a stunning lie about his own military service - his claim to have served "almost three years" in Vietnam. He made this claim several times in 1971, both in speeches and in writing. But his records show that he served no more than a total of 15 MONTHS in Vietnam, and that included his time offshore on a minesweeper. (You can see his military records yourself, linked through his profile at Wikipedia.)   More examples of lies and misrepresentations in the book? How about the part where O'Neill claims that Kerry filmed interviews of himself while in Vietnam - four years before those cameras had sound capability.   In a more egregious example, O'Neill posits, in Chapter 5 of UFC, that George Elliott wrote a Silver Star citation that did not reflect what happened that day. He is not honest enough to use the actual citation written by Elliott, but instead uses a later, edited version and then quotes things - like "numerically superior force" - that Elliott NEVER WROTE. The original citation written by Elliott PRECISELY reflects what happened that day - things he claims he was never told - as do the after action report and Zumwalt's monthly summary. (All of which can be found at SBVT's own archives.)   In this connection, O'Neill claims that Elliott had no idea there were troops on the boats that day (even though he was division commander) and that they conducted the first sweep - although Elliott's citation, the after action report, and the monthly summary SPECIFICALLY state that there were troops on the boats and that the troops conducted the first sweep. He also claims that "[t]here is no indication that Kerry ever reported that the Viet Cong was wounded and fleeing when dispatched" - but Elliott 's citation and the after action report SPECIFICALLY state that Kerry shot a fleeing VC, and the after action report says that the man was wounded.   In addition, O'Neill claims that Hoffmann and Elliott had been told Kerry had "almost single-handedly" taken out a bunker of VC - except NOTHING OF THE SORT appears in the original citation, the after action report, the monthly summary, or the news release for the incident. In fact, the after action report specifically says that "other units saturated [the] area with fire and beached placing assault parties ashore" while Kerry chased the VC. And of course Elliott made it quite clear in William Rood's Bronze Star citation that he didn't think anyone did anything "almost single-handedly" that day.   Again, O'Neill writes with regard to the first action, that "most, if not all, of the non-PCF troops received no medals for this action." (No kidding, he actually writes like that.) C'mon John, it is public information that the only American "non-PCF troops" there that day were the three Army advisors and the three UDT guys -  and all were awarded medals, including two Bronze Stars for the Army advisors.   And consider this. O'Neill sneers that Kerry deserved no more than a commendation medal for his actions that day. That means that none of the half dozen or so Navy officers and crew who earned Bronze Stars - for doing no more than Kerry did - deserved their medals either. No wonder William Rood wrote in disgust, "[T]his is hurting crewmen who are not public figures and who deserved to be honored for what they did. ... While they mean to hurt Kerry, what they're saying impugns others who are not in the public eye."   By the way, despite O'Neill's repeated claims to Ted Koppel and others, the eyewitnesses to the second sweep - including the only member of SBVT who was actually there - have consistently stated that there was substantial enemy fire from multiple VC at the scene. Just look inside those books you were waving at the camera, John. Or better yet, ask SBVT member Larry Clayton Lee, who believes that Kerry earned his medal that day, and whose eyewitness account contradicts just about everything you've said on the matter.   In fact, there is not a single person who was there that day who disputes what happened, or Kerry's medal. Again, as William Rood writes, "It's gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there."   And contrary to O'Neill's claim that the Silver Star was awarded after only two days, "with no review," the record shows it was awarded after six days, and in 1996 Elliott and Lonsdale themselves insisted that all proper review procedures were followed (as did the Navy inspector general, in 2004).   Not such great research, Johnny boy.   Though maybe we should blame some of this on Jerry Corsi. When Corsi's bigotry was revealed in some of his freeper postings, O'Neill promptly claimed that Corsi was not really the coauthor, but that he acted "simply as an editor." Now that's interesting, because aside from the fact that the narrative voice sometimes bounces between first person and third person in the same sentence, and that Corsi continues to brag about coauthoring the book, good parts of Chapters 6 through 9 (at least) are virtually lifted from his screeds at anti-Kerry sites.   Just a little short in the truth department, are we John?   While we're at it, let's ask Mr. Corsi why he REMOVED the picture of Robert McNamara's 1995 meeting with Gen. Giap, which hangs near Kerry's picture in the War Remnants Museum, from his webpage "documenting" the existence of the Kerry picture.   You see, John and Jerry show their readers pictures of other walls in the room from every possible angle (and even throw in a picture of Jane Fonda from a building across town), but conveniently "forget" to show you the most important wall of all...the wall upon which Kerry's picture is displayed. Hmmm, is it because Kerry's picture was displayed along with those of other visiting dignitaries such as McNamara, Warren Christopher, and yes, even ELMO ZUMWALT? New York Sun reporter Josh Gerstein says so ... run a browser search for his August 2004 article exposing this particular bit of sleaze.   Of course it is well known how many other claims in this book have been thoroughly debunked by overwhelming eyewitness testimony, Navy investigators, Navy documents, and in fact some of the accusers' own documents. (Tom Wright didn't patrol with Kerry after he "complained" about him? Not true, according to the command history. George Bates is "haunted" by the slaughter of village livestock? His own crewman claims responsibility for that.  William Franke's "recollections" of Kerry?  He wasn't there at the time. And O'Neill might want to get someone a little more competent to analyze those designator numbers on the March 13 spot report.)   For more point by point rebuttals of the lies contained in this book, go to Eric Rasmussen's most excellent online review, "Truth and Unfit for Command."   John O'Neill has repeatedly lied about his own service in Vietnam. In addition, he has been threatened with court sanctions for his venomous personal style, and passed over for a judgeship. Coming from the man who seconded Richard Nixon's nomination at the '72 convention, why is none of this surprising 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 This book doesn't include any text about stairs. I guess most complete homes don't need stairs. I find this book more of a coffee table book than a book I can count on for howto information 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors.  It is comprised of short stories -- often rather verbose short stories -- rather than the short, meaningful passages in the earlier Chicken Soup books.  The earlier books are studded with post-it stickers saving the innumerable passages I want to reread or frame, and I frequently think back to those wonderful passages.  Not these -- there isn't a single post-it sticker in the entire book, and I'm donating it to the charity fair since there's nothing worth rereading.  To be fair, I suppose that this might prove helpful to someone overwhelmed by insurmountable problems and in need of reading sappy boring story after sappy boring story -- but I, myself, was much more humbled and inspired by the earlier volumes 
 I can't believe I just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten (TEN!!) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit. By the third version, my brain turned to jelly. By the fifth, I needed a drink. By the final re-mixed version, my hangover already started to set in. This e.p. is for DJ's and masochists only. 			- Tom Rya 
 I am so bothered by this DVD, that I don't even know where to begin. So let's start with zero stars and go from there.  Starting with the film itself: Decent acting all around. Decent special effects. Some nice camera work and cinematography. All in all, sets the right mood and delivers a polished output. +1 star for that.  Now, for the script: Just awful. There was no plot to speak of. The same scene was repeated over and over again with little to no variation on the theme. The big "surprise" ending was completely anti-climactic because the characters were never developed enough for you to care one way or the other. Overall, just an absolutely boring story and an even worse script to boot. No points here.  Finally, let's move to the special features: I can appreciate the way that director Courtney Solomon tries to be cutting edge by breaking away from the traditional director commentary and launching into a tirade against Hollywood. But, c'mon man. This was just ridiculous. In some ways, it's worth renting the movie just to see it for yourself. But, to summarize, he sits in a car with an unknown woman by his side and proceeds to bash movie critics and the entire film industry in general. He goes on to tell us how he planted his own reviews, or, worse, how he countered those that he felt were not "legitimate" (defined, I'm sure, as those reviews that did not agree with his own self-inflated opinion of this movie). And then he goes on to talk about how evil all movie critics are and how they can all essentially be bought. If this is true, why did the movie get such poor reviews? Since he obviously spent all sorts of money hiring his own internet crawlers, maybe he should have spent a few extra dollars to buy off a critic or two. I wonder if he would have said any of this stuff if any of those same critics had actually liked his movie. I hate hypocritical garbage from director's like this. Critics are worthless if they pan you, but they're Gods if they actually like your movie. Let's face it, movie critics represent the audience. Their purpose is to help us to make informed buying decisions. And, nine times out of ten, they do just that. All in all, his ranting and raving just confirmed that  the movie we just watched actually did stink. And the fact that he had nothing of substance to tell us about its creation, further confirms that fact.  The one piece of worthy advice that Solomon does give us, I happen to agree with: Let the audience decide whether or not they like the movie. Well, judging by the reviews on this site - it looks like they decided.  For me, 1-star is all I could give 
 This review is more about the "SuperBit" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.  However, the transfer on to this 2002 "SuperBit" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and "Making-Of" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.  They have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.  First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.  "Panic Room" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.  This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.   If they had encoded "Panic Room" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.    Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.  I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.  Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold. 
 As the title says - don't waste your money on this book.  I do not understand the humor in this book.  I thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality.  There is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting.  The author has a thing about teeth (or one tooth)- I don't understand how this relates to the topic at hand.  Also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message.  I find dirty recipe cards unappealing - I don't want to make the food when I have to look at a stained recipe card.  The vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message. I really don't understand the purpose of putting it into this book.  The book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece.  
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way. 
 The author does not waist words when explaining the various 802.11 features.  Extremely dry and boring... Kudos to the person who can read this book and absorb the information.  I felt like I was reading an RFC 
 I bought these Riedel glasses for the reputation of that brand. I was very pleased with the quality. However the glasses are too small to truly enjoy any wine. I recommend the Riedel Vivant model from Target instead 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 I just purchased these in part due to the relatively decent reviews and for the rechargeable aspect, features and brand-name. Took them out to test and really not pleased with the performance. In Florida so mountains and hills are not a major influence in the performance evalution. Also, it was perfect weather. I'm not in an area with high rise buildings, rather outside of town in a mostly residential area. At one mile they began crackling severely with static. At just over a mile-they became non-audible...only the call feature worked. By 1.5 miles-forget it. Full charge, no mountains, no hills, no tall buildings, nothing but a few tree's. Now, I did NOT expect anything near the claimed 14 miles, not even half that. I did expect somewhere between 2-4 mile range in perfect weather...nowhere even near it. On the other hand, the rechargeable aspect is nice, the car adaptor is a great little touch but for the price difference-they barely outperformed the $20 set I purchased as toys for my neice/nephew. Disappointin 
 I've seen all of Elvis' movies, most several times.  This is one of the worst.  Only Stay Away Joe and Harem Scarem are worse.  I usually watch every Elvis movie every time it comes on TV, but not these three 
 I FELT THIS BOOK WAS GEARED TOWARDS THE  OLDER CHILD,MORE SO THAN TODDLERS.NEEDED A SECTION FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN 
 This book is such absolute rubbish as to be beneath critcism though not beneath a proper contempt. Its scientific garbage,logical inconsistancies and sheer historical ignorance and falsity insult the reader's intelligence on every page. No sane or educated person could take it seriously 
 The labels are sticky on one side, and printable on the other, but that's about all this product has going for it.  The software is a nightmare.  The print previews only vaguely represent the finished product, and the program frequently and randomly alters your image.  I wound up using the labels, but creating the documents in MS publisher.  what a shame 
 I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING!   You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong.   The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.    Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.  I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!  
 I love to read about Hollywood, and I know I would enjoy this book if the "Eff-word" wasn't used so much. It proves to me that to get anywhere in Hollywood you have be very low-class and profane. Any really  educated person would have a stronger command of the language. The eff-word is a stupid substitution for any word at all, and I just can't get interested in the book because of it. If you don't mind eff this and eff that you might enjoy the book. Too bad. It could have been a good read 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 Don't waste your time or money.   Should have been a little more romance than cat and mouse.  And, too many characters in this first book.  Setting the stage for the next two books in the series.   It would have been super if it just focus on Cass and Rick Cisco!!  There were alot of depth in the main characters that left you hanging.  Instead of bounceing around with other characters for her second and third book.  The book was a mess and poorly written. I 've never given a author a 1 rating.  Their are others who don't agree.  That is why we can write our own review.   Judge for yourself.   Thank you 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 Well the title kind of says it all. Dull,ugly,boring men in a dull,ugly boring movie. Also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world. Stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley with ugly, skinny, beaked nosed  Denis Leary.Steve Buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film. 
 The author dwells too much on knife fighting rather than the knives.  I found the book to be a disappointment 
   Beware!  If you read this book, know that it misrepresents the Minoans terribly.    Let's begin with the cover.  The vast majority of humans depicted in Minoan art are women.  Furthermore, for every man shown in a (possible) leadership position, there are thirty Minoan women shown in such positions.  Most scholars concede that the political leader of the Minoans could very well have been a woman.  So what does Castleden plaster on the front of his book?  Not only a man, but the only male figure that's ever been suggested as a remotely  possible leader. If this isn't blatant dishonesty of the worst kind, I don't know what is.    And who is Castleden, anyway?  I've looked high and low, and can't find credentials for him.  There are none listed in (or on) his book.  He isn't an archaeologist.  He doesn't seem to be a scientist or academic. He doesn't seem to have any training in anything.  Did he even graduate from high school?  If so, no one's saying.  As the Library Journal reviewer above points out, Castleden spends quite a bit of time blasting "traditional" theories about the Minoans.  In his mind, almost every "traditional" theory is a "wrong" theory.  But as the the LJ reviewer also notes, Castleden offers little or no evidence to support his "new and improved" theories.    Take for example the Anemospilia data.  Not every archaeologist agrees that "human sacrifice" happened at this Minoan site.  Yet Castleden assures us that he KNOWS it did, and, furthermore, that this translates into the Minoans generally practicing human sacrifice (!)  He knows they did, by golly!  He, the "expert" with the mystery credentials, tells us point blank that "the archaeological evidence is not susceptible of any other interpretation" (p. 171, 1994 edn).  Excuse me, Mr. C., but have you read the imminent archaeologist Nanno Marinatos?!?  No?  I thought not.  Marinatos gives that "other interpretation" you so haughtily assure us does not exist.     And then there's war.  The traditional view is that the Minoans maintained peace for 1000 years unbroken.  So of course Mr. C. knows this has to be wrong.  Again Mr. C. refrains from mentioning that not all experts (of which he is not one) agree with him here.  He passes the Minoans off as confirmed warriors (in certain time periods at least), and himself as one with the credentials to know.    I wholeheartedly agree with the Library Journal reviewer: "Castleden frequently proposes scenarios drawn more from psychosocial inference than evidence, yielding arguments less compelling than the originals. A nation of addicts could scarcely have had the energy to execute drug-induced creativity, much less to develop the commercial empire that was ancient Crete under the Minoans...."    Lastly, nothing in this book is referenced -- the first mark of an insecure amateur.    We are forced to rely on Castleden's honesty and integrity about almost every thing he says.  And we've already seen that his honesty is questionable.    
 I was so excited to see this game come out- I loved the Godfather, and From Russia with Love, and the hype surrounding this game was incredible.  The actual game, however, was incredibly disappointing.  The driving controls, especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather, are AWFUL.  I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong, but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to.  Most of the missions involve driving, under a specific time limit, and with these awful controls, I gave up early- way too frustrating.  The musical play list that you get to control was fun, but I would have liked more free-roaming like in the Godfather.  I was also looking forward to hearing everyone's voices that were in the opening credits- Dale Earnhardt Jr???  But since I have almost totally given up on it now, I guess I won't get to hear their voice acting talent.  Does anyone know if they plan to re-release this on the xbox 360?  Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then.  This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 I just had a hard time reading/understanding/finishing this book. I did finally finish it because I wanted to know the mystery behind the author's father, but in the end the whole book was disappointing. I guess it's a matter of the book's structure. The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters. Some of the language sounds awkward, the curse words seem...forced. Also after a while, the author's unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves 
 I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser.   I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED!  It has been gathering dust ever since.  
 I wouldn't use this collection as an intro to mystery fiction, since it barely touches on the traditional aspects of the genre. It is, however, an exercise in the dark and deeply disturbing, which is what I would expect from Joyce Carol Oates. I'm selling this year's collection to my local used bookseller, instead of passing it on to friends as a must read.  
 As an undergrad in college I was required to read this novel for an English course--go figure.  From what I remember the story is centered around a woman who is caught up in a theocratic regime which takes over the US, and she is forced to abhorrent things like have men in the administration sire children through her.  Looking back now, the situation described in the novel reminds me more of the Stalin regime than any type of theocracy I can think of, even the kind they have in some muslim countries (Yevgeny Zamyatins "We" comes more to mind--Stalin admired that novel).  In fact, the "abhorrent" situation I described above is not much unlike the "Lebensborn" program (a.k.a. "human stud farm") which Heinrich Himmler used to propagate the "Aryan" race during the Third Reich.  And you youngsters who have been brainwashed into believing that Hitler's government was Christian, you ought to read up on the occult roots of Nazism (see e.g. Peter Levenda's book) 
 Where are the red turkeys for things that are dangerous? This thing was Designed by an idiot that never rode a bike. There is No rake to the small front wheel. Kids go over the damn handlebars. The designer should be sued 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 What are these reviewers listening to????? If you're age is more than single diget, there can be no reason for a positive review. This is so bad, that I could hardly force myself to listen to the whole cd at least once. I loved SYKES work with THIN LIZZY and was expecting something pretty good. This sets a new benchmark for innane lyrics and rotten recycled riffs. THIS IS COMPLETELY MINDLESS DRIVEL!!!! And those are the better points. I would guess that MARCEL MARCEAU was the sound engineer and that the production was handled by OZZY in a very wasted state. If there is a good guitar solos on this one, it is completely lost in the horrid mix. I am just glad that they achieved the success they so richly deserve   -    total unnonimity. If your familie name isn't SYKES, than there is absolutely no reason to waste money on this shocker.     
 This is the story of a self-annointed entertainment industry mogul, in which Michael Eisner establishes himself as the absolute ruler of Disney (yes, like Louis XIV, to whom Stewart compares him).  In the beginning, there was a balanced team of Eisner, the visionary; Frank Wells, the diplomat who smoothed Eisner's rough edges (you could go to him for "redress" and "understanding"); and Jeff Katzenberg, the glorified gopher of enormous talent and potential.  When this team took over in 1984, many thought that the Disney empire was teetering on the verge of decline, ripe to be acquired and with an animation dept that was all but dead.  The only profitable part was the Disney parks.  They began to seek "one- or two-base hits", that is, relatively inexpensive films for modest hits at high profit (e.g. Down and Out in Beverly Hills).  Over the next ten years, this team engineered a series of smashing successes, from a string of hits to the establishment of the Disney stores and the sales of videos.  Disney became huge: from a revenue of $1.4 billion in 1984, it grew to $30 billion by 2004; price-adjusted for stock splits respectively grew from $1.33 to $25. By any measure, it was a phenomenal run, unprecedented in Hollywood history and even in terms of American culture.  Disney moved into bold new areas of film by establishing a number of production companies of great originality, which Stewart describes competently, if in excessive, yet non-analytic, detail.  However, under the surface, there were serious tensions growing:  by his lies and senseless slights, Eisner was alienating Katzenberg, an executive of superior gifts and judgment, and was tiring of Wells, who soon died in an accident.   Eisner then fired Katzenberg after 19 years of unbelievably productive collaboration; Katzenberg took his gifts to Dreamworks, which many believe is beating Disney animation in both revenues and originality (e.g. Shrek) - that more or less proves it was him, and not Eisner, who was responsible for the golden years of the late 1980s, up to Katzenberg's Lion King.  From the mid-1990s, with Eisner at the pinnacle of his power and (as CEO and CHairman) dominating a meek board, the stage was set for a series of catastrophic decisions that cost Disney billions.  This is when his worst side came out, that of an ego maniac bent on maintaining his power and firing anyone who dissented from him:  he became erratic, vindictive, and unable to question himself in the worst type of narcissism imaginable.  Here, you see the costs of bad decisions:  Euro Disney ($1 billion loss, due to a complete lack of understanding regarding the differences between American and European vacationing), the failed internet ventures  ($1 billion loss), and the acquisition of Fox family cable ($1 billion loss, due to insufficient commercial analysis and due diligence regarding distribution rights).  Even the films became risky attempts at blockbusters (home runs), in accordance with the Hollywood formula of extremely expensive talent and ever more spectacular special effects, though most of them flopped.  THen there were the personnel disputes, which Eisner seemed to relish:  he refused to settle with Katzenberg's contract-based bonus for $90 million in an Ovitz-negotiated deal, going instead to court and eventually settling for nearly $300 million; picking his best friend, superagent Ovitz, and firing him in one year at a similar price.  But the list of lost talent, both execs and animators, is a horrible indictment of an intolerant man who could not question his own judgment.   Finally, you get the story of his ouster, after he alienated even his board and virtually all of his creative collaborators, such as Pixar and the Miramax studio brothers (the Weinsteins), who were the independent groups that produced most of the hits that Disney distributed.  In my opinion, the book often reads like a hack job by a journalist who essentially disliked his subject, or at least disrespected him; while Stewart strives to sound neutral and fair, it is clear he despises Eisner.  That is about it for the story.  Unfortunately, I was looking for more about how Disney was run strategically as well as a view inside the black box of decisionmaking and method.  How did it become a manufacturer of popular culture, beyond the original entrepreneur and pioneer of genius, Walt Disney?  This is not the book to answer that.  Instead, it is more like a score card about battling corporate titans, none of whom are attractive people - and we would be naive to think that they might be - and it endlessly catalogues their brutal maneuvering and sleazy intrigues at the expense of the nuts of bolts of how they engineered their successes and ran their business. You get very little about the Disney company and way way too much of an attack on Eisner alone as a person and secondly as a manager.  As such, it is yet another dreary description of a dysfunctional corporate environment, with some irony thrown in about how it is supposed to produce stories that make customers happy.  Nonetheless, at the end, I did not feel I understood much about Eisner's deeper motivations or character, or for that matter those of any of his colleagues and competitors.  The chronology is also  hopelessly confused, the descriptions of innumerable details of film productions seemingly irrelevant rather than enlightening.   This was a great disappointment to me.   I recommend it only to those interested in Hollywood trivia and not to those wishing to learn about how corporations might be better run, though it is an interesting lesson in failed corporate governance 
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 DONT BUY it from AMAZON!   I got burned, I bought what was supposed to be the new delux edition and what I received was the original CD release.  I'd rather buy items like this from official stores instead of Amazon after that hell of an experience.  Over-all, its a great albu 
 I thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot. It was terrible. First because of the camera shake, I don't know about you but I can't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking. Needless to say I didn't make it through the whole film, but from what I saw the main actor was irritating to watch 
 I sort of happened upon Bill Charlap when I heard "Somewhere" because there is a decided lack of exciting piano trios around, unless you still like the Keith Jarrett factory.  Charlap is one of those guys who has incredible almost orchestral subtlety, and gets that sparkling sound out of his piano lines, but still makes it sound like he's not even trying very hard.  But the addition of the horns on this CD ruins it for me - Charlap loses control, and the rest of the musicians turn this into a jam session with tunes that are, let's face it, not that exciting by themselves anymore.  I like Payton's energy, but it doesn't seem to mesh with the group.  Even when the horns are cut out, "Liza" seems hurried.  "I Was So Young" is nice, but even that doesn't have the harmonic or compositional freshness of Charlap's full trio CDs.  Compare Charlap plays Gershwin with the Fred Hersch Trio +2, a great example of a trio pianist really taking the time to flesh out and expand his ideas with wind instruments.  I hope Charlap takes his time with his next CD, because he's capable of something original and fresh and that's so rare today 
 If nothing else, the slimmer page-count in this volume made it a much quicker read than his previous book "The Soccer Field Is Empty."  The dialogue was still more than a little stilted, and some of the amazing deus ex machinas lead me to roll my eyes.  As with his pervious novel, Mr. Roeder clearly has a great deal of affection for his characters and the idealized world they inhabit.  But with any author attempting to publish his own work, the affection can be a bit of detriment.    With that said, I do admire Mr. Roeder's chutzpah evidence in creating this world and sticking with it.  Decent book for the beach or an airplane, but not high art 
 I can't believe that anyone would believe this nonsense! This is the kind of book that may be praised by homosexuals who are trying to convince us that perverted behavior is good instead of evil, but it belongs in the trash with the rest of the garbage 
 I wanted a book that would show in detail how to do different styles.  This book only contained a brief description on braids and cornrows.  I also did not like the author recommending straighteners for kinky hair.  I wanted a book on how to work with my daughter's natural hair, not on how to change it 
 I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably 
 This book is typical, self-aggrandizing fare for the baby boomers. It almost has the weird sheen of revisionist history.  Some topics glossed over; The average American reads on a sixth grade level.  This country's educational system is in shambles.  Greed rules the day. The quaint retirement programs and "golden handshakes" are long gone. Companies cut what the can when they can.  The gap between the rich and poor was never wider.  The boomer's retirement will bankrupt the nation, social security, and Medicare. (Look up the cost estimation for Alzheimer's Disease).  Lets talk about how relevant we are!!   Self-absorbed garbage from and for people who love to hear themselves talk. 
 I thought this was an enjoyable book for the most part, but I am bewildered by the blurb on the back comparing the author's scholarly contribution to the work of Copernicus. Wouldn't that suggest that she would at least have an original and clear thesis in there? Instead, we get a mish-mash of gossip, innuendo, and lame puns for over 500 pages. The closest I came to finding a thesis was the idea that bisexuality is extremely common yet has been denied for centuries... which wasn't even original when Freud said it. The book reads like the sort of thing Entertainment Weekly would have published; the thinking is fuzzy and superficial, and the writing is glib and confused. Entertaining for what it is, but, as scholarship, it shows mostly how far the Ivy Leagues have fallen 
 Yes, it's the rags-to-riches story of a hard working, resourceful man. But a storyteller he is not. It is a painfully drawn out and wandering story, much like listening to your grandfather telling you about the "good old days."  Giving a distracting level of detail, and naming what must be everyone that Mr. Rosenberg worked with or knew over his long career gives the reader the feeling that the writer simply transcribed this repetitive and wandering tale. Though Mr. Rosenberg proved to be a successful entrepreneur, I doubt he was as all-knowing as he suggests. He claims credit for virtually every good decision and denies responsibility for bad ones. I feel sorry for the son who Mr. Rosenberg claims to love so much. The son was given little credit for the success of the enterprise despite the fact that it was his son who ran the day-to-day business since becoming President in 1963. Yes, there is much that can be learned from this book - work hard, care about your product, and treat people fairly - but it seems to me that Mr. Rosenberg must have forgotten some of his own advice 
 This abridged edition leaves out many of the most famous passages in this wonderful play. Also, the quality of the sound is very poor. I have bought all the other audio Shakespeare. This is the worst and not worth buying 
 The premise was unbelievable.   I could care less about the characters. It was a hard, long slog to finish.  It was as if the author was filling space by looking at a map to give us some place names to sound authentic.  Fred mailed this one in. (American slang.)  "The Faithful Spy" is close to the same premise and about ten times better 
 In order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records.  I had hoped for a "cookbook" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.    The info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web.  That's my primary complaint with this book...  it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.  Instead of this book, I recommend you:  (1)  Get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)  (2)  buy The Corporate Minutes Book by Anothony Mancuso instead of this book 
 This book is poorly organized, badly written, and so difficult as to be virtually incomprehensible to all but the most advanced mathematics students. Even the infrequent examples skip so many steps that they are hard to follow. Do not torture yourself with this book unless it is absolutely required - and unless first you have vigorously but unsuccessfully lobbied against its use.  Pair this textbook with a sub-par instructor and you will be living a nightmare.  Surely there is a more user- friendly option available 
 You should purchase my book first before criticising it. It took me over 2 years of research to write it.   Every negative review of my book is fake and was written by people paid by the pharmisudical companies to destroy my excellent reputation.   Rather than go by what you hear, purchase my informational, virus-diease curing book today, and get on the road to health! 
 Tragically Kurtz drags humanism down the well worn path of global collectivism in keeping with the socialist slant that underpins much of this manifestos yearnings and regretablly much of the humanist leadership and community. The call for an international government body and the policing of various entities under a type of global judicial fiat that Kurtz waxes poetic for should chill the bones of the reader who believes in liberty and human rights grounded in individual responsibilities. Kurtz offers a vision for the future which is in monolithic antipathy to those of us who have recognized the necessity of a libertarian focus if we are to acheive a successful, sustainable humanist aim.  The appeal for a mega-state that Kurtz places his humanism faithfully within, is inimical to those who celebrate freed minds and freed lives. The idea of the state as benevolent social guardian and moral arbiter has seduced academics and peasants alike for ages. Yet history shows that the more a society predicates its future upon the ever growing machinations of the state, the greater individuals suffer. I have no reason to believe a worldwide governing body would fare any better, no matter how humanist based it claimed to be. A libertarian based humanist manifesto has yet to be penned or even cogently voiced, but its time is long overdue  
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 This book does not represent the views of any of the Catholics I know, so I am left to wonder whether Mr. Johnson is appealing to some obscure hard-lined fundamentalist faction in the church. This book's contents particularly saddened me because the Catholic Church--being a church comprised of highly educated clergy--has historically accepted evolution.   I first learned about church views of evolution from my grandfather who was a Professor of paleontology (The study of the fossil record of past geological periods) at a well-respected Catholic University. My grandfather was a believer in evolution and a Third Order Dominican, simultaneously. Catholics who believe in evolution accept that our belief in God, the Bible's teachings and evolution are compatible. God is great and mysterious and God's universe (history included) is great and mysterious.   In addition to being neither enlightened nor insightful, Mr. Johnson's "scientific" arguments show that he has a very shallow, piecewise understanding of evolutionary biology and its theories. I'm qualified to say this because I am both a Catholic and an evolutionary biologist.   It is difficult to see so many other readers applauding such linear and fundamental thinking. Darwin was brilliant and Mr. Johnson is not.  
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 These are some of the most uncreative and blatantly stupid jokes I've ever heard. He has a crude gimmick and his delivery is flaccid and reminiscent of Pauly Shore, only it's somehow worse. I'm absolutely astonished that anyone could derive any sort of joy from this guy's act. I'm convinced the audience on this CD was either intensely drugged or completely edited in. Even Dane Cook can be funny at times but Mitch Fatel is reprehensibly bad 
 This is one of the worst endtimes novels I've ever read.  The dialouge is horrible, the characters paper thin and the plot obvious and boring.  There's much better out there.  Save your money and try We All Fall Down by Caldwell or the Last Day by Kleier.  Both are thoughtful, wonderful reads.  This is neithe 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 Derrida, the renowned French postmodernist and author of, among other things, "Writing and Difference", is at it again in his latest effort, "Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas." His work is designed to cast great doubt on  the classical notions of truth, reality, meaning, and knowledge. The goal  is reprehensible, but Derrida can usually pull it off. "Adieu to Emmanuel  Levinas" is thus a major disappointment to all those fans of outmoded  deconstructionist French philosophers.  The book suffers from being far too  personal, and lacks detail. Anecdotes abound, but they are, in toto, not  particularly interesting or helpful ones, mostly along the lines of  childhood vacations to the beach and the like. As for the few attempts  Derrida makes to actually deal with PHILOSOPHY, detail is sorely lacking.  When a reader comes upon phrases like "the hermeneutics of orangutans,"  he/she really deserves to have some idea what the author is talking about.  Sometimes you just want to read about eschatalogical polemics or  signifier/signified interrelations, but you won't find that here. Seen in  this, or any other light, "Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas" falls pancake-flat.  Spend your money on something that makes sense to somebody other than the  author. I am sad now and it is Jaques Derrida's fault 
 My wife died two years ago, and I have consulted several mediums who have been able to give me some indication that her consciousness survived.  The best Medium of all the ones I tested was a woman named Laurie Campbell, she absolutely blew my mind with all the details she provided.  Anyway, I went to the VERITAS site recently to rebook a reading, and found an alarming "comparitive analysis" of the "resigned" Mediums versus newly appointed ones....A Dr. Julie Beischel conducted the "scientific study"...and it seems that she has some serious rater bias!  Does she have something against the "resigned" Mediums, that she would manipulate data, to try to keep a float?  I had a reading with one of the two Mediums listed on her "approved list", let me warn you ahead of time, she was no Laurie Campbell!  I was so disappointed with the reading that I received from the "lab approved Medium" that I cried....I quickly realised that people who have half ass skill should not be consulting the bereaved, she did more damage to me and did not help.....I will have to wait now for another 10 months before I can have another reading with Ms. Campbell, but it is a wait worth waiting for, when one is seeking the TRUTH about survival.....My reccomendation is to NOT listen to the TRUTH of what Beischel and Schwartz reports, because I have first hand experience that points to their current "Mediums" are not worth your precious money....and even worse can leave you feelings empty, and robbed 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 Couldn't use an electronic device without a chord,  Big hasse 
  Folks, don't spend too much time in fantasy land!  While purporting to be an "insider", Robert Lomas has alienated himself from most of The Fraternity by breaking his obligation and detailing his experience of initiation.  If he's willing to break an obligation like that, just think of the crap he's willing to publish.  Fortunately, his is a gross mischaracterization of the experience and ritual varies widely in different regions.  The experience of initiation is meant to be very personal and is different for each individual - so it's a disservice for Lomas to give his interpretations to the world in this way.  One would walk away with Lomas' view of Freemasonry and not the view of 99.99% of Masons.  Suffice it to say, if you're speaking with Masons I wouldn't mention Lomas' name - you might get a weary look and be quickly labelled as an oddball.  There are plenty of other good books that are more factual and would be a better use of your time 
 First, a disclaimer: I'm not submitting a bad review just to be contrarian, or to lower this artist's average star rating, or to be in any way malicious.  I also admit that Matt Nathanson and those of his ilk probably don't align wih my particular taste in music.  So writing this might be something akin to Thurston Moore reviewing Johnny Mathis' Greatest Hits.  I would venture to say, however, that Thurston Moore never had to sit in a car for four hours listening to Johnny Mathis.  This was my experience yesterday: with a four-hour drive from Crested Butte, Colorado to Denver still mostly ahead of us, the person driving (whom we had just met, and whose affinity for Christian Rock was unknown to us) decided to cue up this abomination of an album, which was followed by the live album, and then some other folk dreck by a criminal named Marc Broussard.  I like folk, old and new--Iron and Wine, Joni Mitchell, John Prine, Guy Clark--and I suppose that this isn't Christian music, despite its appearance on an ipod that was otherwise laden with Michael W. Smith, DC Talk, and Amy Grant.  It sure sounds like Christian music, though; it's no small wonder that I loathed it without the aid of my anti-Christian biases.  In reality, Nathanson might do well to consider inserting some Christian-sounding cliches into his lyrics, or even being "born-again."  It would expand his audience and sell more records, which is all he's trying to do anyway.  It's a career move that worked for George W. Bush, and no one seems to think that he's cynical or insincere . . .          
 I loved these earbuds for the first two months. I raved to my friends. I bought pairs for several people at work. Then, about a month later, my boss came to me and told me one of the earbuds stopped producing sound. I thought it was because she was rough on them, but then quickly thereafter, my earbuds did the same thing... then another coworker had the same problem... all withing weeks of each other after purchasing them around the same time.   I know they're cheap. I know they're comfortable, but seriously, you're going to spend three or four times the amount over the course of a year just replacing them, so you might as well buy something slightly more expensive and get more wear from them 
 this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?!  you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far 
   My daughter had to have this play set to go with the toddler doll (they are advertised in the same commercial). It is cumbersome, clumsy and difficult to play with.  It requires more assembly than I would have liked and more space for play that it seems.  It is just an awkward toy 
 This is not as big as it looks in the picture. It is tiny! You have to heat up the water yourself separately and then pour it into this piece of junk. There is no electric heating. Stay away from this 
 Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story. 
 Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled.  Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film "relevant" to today's "hip" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated).  While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film.  As is often the case, viewers will find that "the book is much better than the movie."  The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds.  
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 If you think this is a new title, beware.  It is a new title on an old text: Picture Book of the Continental Soldier (Stackpole Books, 1969). The contents are dated, i.e, the hunting shirt pattern bears no resemblance to the original at Newburgh, NY Washington's HQ, research shows the cooking gear was more like tin buckets than iron pots, the cartridge pouches became standardized during the war, enlisted mens tents are not as they are pictured, the Pickering musket tool was probably never made as none have ever been found, etc...  For the 1960's this book was pretty good, but 30+ years of research contradicts much of what this book pictures as being typical Continental soldier equipment 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 "Looker" is a very stylish film and was always one of my favorite Michael Crighton efforts (even better than "Westworld") and I would have rated it a solid 4 stars if it weren't for this *terrible* transfer job they did on it.  The problem is not with clarity, color or sound -- it's with the film gate.  They must have used the absolute worst machine in the world, because the image constantly moves even during static scenes.  If you watch this on a small (26" or smaller) set it may not bother you, but anything larger will drive you crazy, I can assure you.  Which is a terrible shame, because this little sleeper of a film (it went almost unnoticed when released) is worth seeing.  It contains one of Crighton's favorite themes -- tech misused or gone out of control -- and has the great Albert Finney giving a rare performance as an adventure hero.    My advice -- definitely don't buy this film.  Rent it from Netflix and give it a watch, particularly if you don't have a nice big screen TV.  Perhaps if and when this is released on high def they'll do a much better job (and then it would indeed be worth a buy) 
 Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead.... 
 I have had to replace my Audiovox DVD Player twice!  The first time was because the sensor was not reading the DVD; the second was because the rechargeable battery would not charge.  And, now Audiovox is telling me that to buy a new battery will cost $79.00 plus shipping and handling.  This cost is 3/4 the cost I paid for the 2nd audiovox.  And, of course, they (Audiovox) will not offer any discount or compensation for their "sad" product.  And, the sound/volume is horrible with earphones! Sometimes it's worth to pay for a quality name brand product, that has value 
 This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.  However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.  Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking 
 I read so much about her down to earth humor and wit that I picked her up. You have to be really right wing, and realy christian to truly enjoy her book. And if you are, you will enjoy her breezy depictions of her marriage, identify with her horror at discovering her son has succumbed to the `homosexual lifestyle' (as the blurb puts it.) and egg her on all the way, upbeat despite all her travails. If you are slightly more iiberal, you will question the very basis of this book, think her humor extremely offensive (he cannot be gay, he is a christian) and believe there are many people who have lead much more difficult lives than her, who do not try and make a book out of it. 
 I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about.  What a let down.  However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins.  Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans.  I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever.  But, this is down right ridiculous.  I mean, give me a break here.   It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories 
 If you are a novice EE student, never buy this book. This is not an introduction in the sense we usually think. In a word, terrible 
 Whose idea was it to have a woman play a pirate captain? Geena Davis isn't even remotely convincing in this movie, but blaming her for this tragedy would be unfair. As this colossal casting mistake annoys the viewer all the time, it is almost impossible to judge this movie with a neutral view. The movie itself is exciting and the acting level isn't bad. That is why I think it is so terribly unfortunate that they messed everything up by casting Geena Davis as Morgan. You CANNOT have a woman perform swordfights with 3 men at the same time! (SARR)     
 If Paleo people were so fit and healthy why do authors of this book put so much empahsis on importance of sports drinks? How about soda bicarbonate to improve one's performance, or caffeine? So where do we draw the line? Either promote NATURAL way of nourishing our bodies or lets have a list of supplements (as long as they are still legal) to give an athlete the edge. Too bad our ancestors did not have access to energy jels 
 I heard lots of hype for this when it came out which caused me to purchase this one instead of the original. Theres a short homosexual scene when The Sgt is in the German hospital and he is kissed on the lips by the medic or doctor. Did that go on that much that theres a need to portray it. I'm surprised in 1980 this was filmed or even thought of since gay was not in back then. Also the scene of him spanking the Hitler youth who shot the G.I. was stupid. The scenes added I could have done without, not too much substance in them. The editors were right the first time when they did this without Fullers permission. I liked it before when there was a sense of honor and pride that I got from the movie, without the sex and useless characters added 
 I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!!  If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade.  But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook!  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or "the MAN" 
 This book is bossy, opinionated and completely unrealistic for any woman who has kids, or works, let alone both.  Sure, there are some good hints and tips; but the last thing that frantic women need is yet more things to add on their to-do lists, and to be made to feel bad if they don't plan their Christmas gift-buying in July or flip their mattress 4 times a year.  Don't buy this book - the useful tips are overshadowed by the theme running throughout that you're failing as a wife and mother if you don't check off their endless tasks.  Happy, well-adjusted households do not need to have pristine closets.. 
 I had ordered this mother goose book, but I am not  comfortable reading it to my children. Here are some of the things said in this book "I had to go to London to buy me a wife," "Tom was beat," "give a barber a pinch of snuff," and "I'll grind his bones to make my bread." There are also two rhymes that include a thief who keeps stealing things until someone beat's him on the head and a kid telling a doctor that they don't like them for no reason at all. These are not things that I want to teach my child. This is a terrble book! I know these are classic nursery rhymes, but the are not politically correct and I wouldn't want my child repeating them 
 I think I always had a soft place in my heart for the Jewish people long before I became a Christian.  After accepting the Lord as my Savior, that softness flamed into  love for these children of Jacob/Israel because out of their ancestral line came Jesus and because they preserved the very word of God.  Parts of Brown's book, I found very troubling.  Mans' inhumanity to man is gut-wrenching; we are capable of  horrific things.  What was not brought out in the book is an explanation - not an excuse - why people did what they did.  Anti-semitism and any other anti-something - even anti-Christianity - must be taught to tender ears and moldable hearts -  the uninformed, ignorant and child-like (no matter what age)- by the biased, hate-filled and spiritually blind. In our falleness, hatred is a language we seem to grasp well while love seems mostly limited to a few of our own if they meet our expectations and standards.  I agree with Mr. Brown that the church 'visible' needs much to seek forgiveness from the Jewish people but what puzzles me is "Jewish people by their own teaching say only the victim can accept forgiveness". How then does this forgiveness happen ?   And so, in joy, I turn to the gospel of Christ as the only viable peace offering not by broken man but by a loving God.  The gospel is the only channel by which God touches our hard hearts and breaks down the wall between gentile and Jew and makes one new man.  Only through God's power can one sincerely seek for forgiveness and can forgiveness be accepted in humbleness.  This is the church 'invisible' and it is alive and growing.   In areas of the world where authentic Christianity is lacking, anti-semitism thrives.  My greatest prayer for the Jewish people is that they may see Jesus as their Messiah and that gentile and Jew can worship together in Spirit and truth.  To God be the Glory for His Son: the Prophet Moses spoke of, the King promised David, and our High Priest, in the order of Melchizedek, who intercedes for us unlike any other 
 How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me, but there he is. For the most part, Hank sounds like just what he really is, a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star. He does hit the mark on occasion as with `The American Dream' and `A Country Boy Can Survive' but mostly this is just fluf 
 There's nothing unique about this text - all the topics & discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on Corporate Finance, Mergers etc....   The discussions lack depth. The whole concept of Corporate Strategy has been miscontrued by the authors.... The link between this and Financial Markets is very ambiguous & blur!  FYI I'm a businessman & hold an MBA in Finance from an international university 
 relative to the topics discussed in this book, it is useless because Nick Saban relatively does not accept the relativeness of this book that he says should be relative to the relevance of your life 
 I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever.  Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police?  It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals.  The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive.  Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste.  My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore.  Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously 
 Bad, bad, bad movie. Bad. Insipid acting (particularly on Theron's part), horrible writing, it's unbelieveable, paper-thin and most of it is truly boring, despite the backdrop of war, death, Nazis and Paris. It takes a genuine lack of talent to be able to pull that off. While the costuming and the soundtrack are fantastic, the movie looks like it's been set on a soundstage producers would use in the 40's, I had a hard time believing most of the sets were on locatio, and they just looked fake. And the ending, pooh. By that time, you barely care about the characters and hope the thing just ends quickly. A very irritating a cheesy movie, it tries desperately to be aloof and melodramatic at the same time. Ugh 
 We were not able to play 2 of the discs on our DVD player.  We were sent a replacement and the same two discs did not work either.  I am waiting for a return label to return both sets and am hoping for a full refund of the product.  We were very dissapointed and hope the problem is fixed.  Amazon actually gave us a $10.00 credit for this problem, Sarita McNall 
 If you already have some design experience, or use the web a lot in your daily life, or just have common sense you will most likely find this book utterly useless. But even for people who are just starting out in the field, at 236 pages this book can easily be compressed into 37 with one page per "signal."    Here's what specifically bothers me about the content:  1.  Wordy.  The authors take a simple problem and run with it for pages.  How many examples do I really need to understand that limiting text fields to, let say, 200 characters and not letting users know that there is a limit is a bad idea? One? Two?  There are 5 examples beating the same dead horse.  And this is going on pretty much for every example they have.  2.  Clueless.  One of the complaints in the book is about an error message that TicketMaster displays when they can't find tickets for you (page 75). Specifically, the message is "We are unable to fulfill your specific request.  We may not have the type of tickets you requested or the number of seats together that you are looking for."  The authors' beef with this message is "[...] the error message still leaves me scratching my head.  If TicketMaster knows the event is sold out, then why not just say so?"  Perhaps, they don't say that the event is sold out because it isn't?  First, just because TicketMaster is out of tickets doesn't mean there are no more tickets left. TicketMaster usually only gets a percentage of tickets.  Second, if I'm looking for cheapest seats and they don't have any left, doesn't mean there aren't more expensive available.  Thirdly, if I'm looking for 7 seats in a row and can't find that many available doesn't mean I can't buy them on other combinations.  3. Superficial.  When talking about handling 404 "Page not found" errors, the author completely neglects to mention the intricacies of handling these conditions which can have profound effect on your site's SEO.  All-in-all, I'm taking my book back to the store. 
 This book is an OK introduction to the area real estate investment, but there are very little helpful specifics.  There are, as other reviews have noted, a lot of sales pitches for Mr. Hicks' other packages and business ventures.  Also, he is a huge proponent of getting in debt as much as possible and with poor terms and interest rates, which is a controversial way to go about things IMO.  There has to be better books out there.  Glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it 
 I expect this sold a few copies in Levittown but if you want a pictorial history of this fascinating suburb, as I did, forget this book.  Unfortunately nearly every one of the two hundred photos is either blurred, soft focused or not even relevant. It is as if the originals were all photocopied and these copies sent to the printer.  The inflexible layout means all the photos are either one or two columns wide and printed with a 133 screen on soft paper does not help either.  I can only guess that the authors wanted to produce the book as cheaply as possible, nearly all the photos are copyright free (I assume) and credited to the Levittown Public Library Collection.   The most interesting chapter to me was the one dealing with the construction of Levittown, even with the awful photos you can see the wood frame construction of the houses, the cement block floors with the heating pipes and there are several pictures of the Cape Cod and Ranch type units which make up the 17,500 houses in the suburb.  In the back of the book are several photos (and these, taken by co-author Tova Navarra, are probably the best in the book) of the remodelling that most of the houses have gone through depending on the owner's needs.  Plenty of photos show life in Levittown but as they are no better than snap-shots they don't do justice to the people shown, the place or the reader.  All very disappointing because having just read Barbara Kelly's excellent book `Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown', I think there is an opportunity for some publisher to do a well designed coffee-table pictorial history with good photos of the houses, their interiors, construction, community life, house blueprints, maps and more.  `Levittown: The First 50 Years' makes me want to know more and done properly.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover 
 I completed this whole book and it was absolutely nothing like the computer-test.  The questions were so much easier in the book.  For example, I was getting around a 730 on the quantitative with the review book, I ended up getting a 510 on the real exam.  Now I am going to pay $2000 for a tutor because I am afraid that if I use another book it will be the same garbage 
 A book about a self-absorbed, narcissitic, selfish, emotionally draining, emotionally immature, and delusional woman who tries to pass herself off as an artist. Nearly two decades ago a friend of mine gave to me a copy of "The Artist's Way." I loved it and over the years have given many copies of it as gifts to people in my life. I, too, purchased "The Vein of Gold" when it was first released. Based upon these books I expected a life of a generous, balanced, sane woman. My intuition when I saw her photo on the back of the book told me to beware. She looks like a psycho in her photo and that is who I found her to be in her own words. For one who claims to be spiritual I found only endless drama, addiction, and self-absorbtion in her tale of herself. It is frightening to know that this woman earns the money she does. I stopped writing my morning pages for a few days because I feared becoming as warped as Julia Cameron. She rants and rages about eveyone in her life being addicted to money, fame, and fortune while ignoring her endless addictions. Writing is not art to her, it is an addiction. She is addicted to herself. I pity her daughter who had, in essence, to rear herself and be a mother to Ms. Cameron, because Ms. Cameron was too sick and self absorbed to even be present for her daughter. Ms. Cameron is the most dangerous of minds:one who thinks that she is spiritual and holier than thou while living for nothing but herself. The amount of fossil fuel alone that she has consummed for all her dozens of cross-country moves is enough to make any sane person sick over her lack of conscious living. She is all that is wrong with this country. Sadly, I do know of many dedicated, sane, and endlessly giving and available writing teachers. Ms. Cameron is not one of them. Never again will I give a copy of "The Artist's Way" as a gift. I cannot support such vanity. I pray that she gets the help she needs for her mental illness. If the book were well written, perhaps I could find compassion for her. But, alas, it is a tome of her excusing her endlessly unacceptable behavoir. 
 I can't make myself buy this DVD. I was going to purchase it, but then I read where O.J. Simpson is in one of the skits. Can't do it now. Maybe there will be a "Best of Belushi Part 2" that doesn't have an O.J. Simpson appearance. Peace and long live the "classic" SNL! 
 Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me.  besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous.  About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down.  I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).  This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc.  Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this 
 I have oily & blemish prone skin and I was told by my Mother, who used to work for the Clinique/Estee Lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. This product irritated my skin so much that I just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. The only reason why I used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. If it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than I ever had all at once. Not worth your money 
 This book belongs to the George Steiner school of writing - extremely pretentious, aggressively obscure, frustratingly allusive, barely grammatical. (How can Cambridge, home of Russell and Moore, I. A. Richards and Wittgenstein, tolerate, let alone produce, this kind of pseudo-erudite claptrap?) Here is how Derrida would write if he wrote in English. Fortunately the virtues of clarity and solid, plain-spoken prose are more celebrated among English speakers than French, so Dunn is hardly likely to assume the mantle of public intellectual he so evidently craves. Move on: you're not missing anything here 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 As an instructor I felt the book was very good, but the students could not use the software on excel 97 or above. It was really frustrating, and I will not use it next semester 
 Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality 
 It's sounds great for a FM transmitter.  Beware I bought 3 of them, each time one of the channels would go out.  Usually in less than a week.  I liked the sound so much I even made up a splint type thing for the cord.  Nothing works. Irock if you read these reviews then answer this.  Why would you make the cord so flexible if it was going to cause it to malfunction? I would pay ten dollars more if the thing would last!  Got the Belkin digital one (not the 4 station preset one) and it doesn't sound as good. BUT IT WORKS FOR MORE THAN A WEEK!!! 
 I'm scared to death of aliens, and I love nothing more than a good campfire tale, so I was so excited when I found this book.  I expected it to be a collection of great, creepy, true-sounding stories, kind of like urban legends, that you could tell to a group of friends to keep them up at night.  Boy, was I wrong.  It's just a collection of short stories about aliens.  Most of them are more sci-fi like than scary.  I was expecting stories of the traditional "alien encounter" type, but that's not what's in here.  They're not horribly written, just not really what the book promises.    The shape of the book is great, though.  It's got a sturdy cover, and it's made sort of like a field guide.  If it did contain creepy tales to tell around the campfire, it would be perfect to stuff in your backpack.  Too bad. 
 Although they claim that this item can be used by adults, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water, which you wouldn't know until you buy it.  Due to this, you can't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its' side with even the most mild of punches. Also, after a few hits, it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on.    The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment. This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag.  Save your twenty five dollars for something else 
 Nothing special here. Just a story of a sex maniac from Sudan. Tayeb Salih uses flowery language to address basic themes (such as west vs east cutures) found in most cultural books. For a book this thin, I found it to be pretty disturbing and boring 
 this books needs two things desparately:  a) A new edition: the last edition was in 2002 - things have changed quite a lot since then, and  b) More details on the technologies than interviews with one and sundry - books that just present interviews on who accomplished what are "let me feel nice about this technology" kind as opposed to "how do I really understand and implement this technology 
 It goes without saying that this man is a pioneer of his craft, however there are throngs of contemporary chefs who are doing things with food that show that they know their ingredients better than Peterson does- good cooking is a result of knowing your ingredients and knowing them well. Peterson claims that there is little, if any, difference between Wild, farm-raised, and Atlantic salmon. This is preposterous! The difference is oceanic. Perhaps Peterson has never eaten Wild King Alaskan salmon or Copper River Sockeye salmon or anything from the Yukon River, which is a real pity, because one of our lifetime's greatest foodies is missing out on the greatest culinary experience of all time! Save you money and spend it on Peterson's Fish & Shellfish. Even the salmon recipes are better 
 The author makes a valiant attempt to create an entire narrative out of a few shreds of fact.  I was interested in Helga's story (though long passages of the book are tedious going), but in the end, I was hugely frustrated by the complete lack of information on the daughter who accompanied her step for step.  What, oh what, became of Clara?  How can the author present as history an account that focuses on only one of the two persons involved?  Did Clara marry?  Did she have children and grandchildren?  Did she ever speak or write of her epic walk?  Was she shunned by the family, as her mother was?  We simply don't know, after reading this book, and are left to wonder why there is no further information on Clara.   Ultimately, this book is a failed historical account of an intriguing personal adventure.  Another reviewer suggested the story would have made a much better novel than nonfiction; considering the lack of primary information, I have to agree.   
 Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God "out of the box," such as Tiffany Snow's "Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect." Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's "7 Laws" though, and some of his other works 
 I am furious with this book. It's 300 pages of advertisement you have to pay for.  What it says is this: "Hey, the Quigong exercises by Chunyi Lin will heal the planet, but you'll have to buy our $250 self-study course to learn it." There are two exercises included in this "book", half-assedly explained. The rest is Chunyi's story and page after page of testimonials (yes - TESTIMONIALS! Like the cheesy ones on those webpages where people are desperately trying to sell you things). Ye Gads! Why did I buy it?  Bottom line: If you really want to learn this system, don't waste your money on this book - rather, get the self-study course from learningstrategies.com or attend one of his classes 
 Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story.  With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique.  However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting.  In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading.  I hated this book.  It is one of the worst stories I have read in years.  I am so mad that I paid for this.  Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil.  It fails miserably 
 Not as they appear!, March 8, 2007 Reviewer: Rappster (Denver, CO) - See all my reviews  I ordered these earrings on a 'Gold Box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive. They were SUCH a disappointment, I returned them the next day. I did not expect the diamonds to be huge, based on their cttw, but the earrings themselves are miniscule! They look like they were made for children. I tried on one earring and couldn't even SEE the earring in my ear, much less tell there were any diamonds--it looked like I didn't even have an earring on!      
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 The example letters are uniformly dreadful.  Marginal grammar and usage combine with a sacherine style aimed at kissing up to second-raters.  These letters are guaranteed to repell anyone with whom one would really like to work 
 This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it 
 I have liked older Nanci Griffith a great deal. This is not those albums. I also have great affection for the protest singers of the 60s and 70s, but this is not that, either. Gee, war is bad, Nanc? Thanks for pointing that out. The lyrics on this one have all the profundity of a slightly slow 12 year old. As someone with degrees in English and Women's Studies, I was insulted by "Back When Ted Loved Sylvia." The track where Nanci tries scat-singing sounds like she is being poked with a sharp stick. Throughout, I was very surprised someone on the staff producing this did not point out that changing your vocal timbre and volume drastically in the space of three notes is jarring and unpleasant. Very very unimpressive 
 It seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best, just include the words Power,Prestige, wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life, Power talk fails to live up to its title. It is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about. But it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two? This book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives, if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably won't help much. The key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary, structure , etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy. Probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title 
 Who remastered it?  It sure wasn't Bob; find the UNremastered CD if you can.  Or better yet, - the original LP is absolutely amazing.  This remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is "New and Improved" when it is neither.  For the best experience in appreciating Bob Marley and what he accomplished, read a biography, then listen to all the ORIGINAL albums.  Here are some of my favorite Bob Marley songs that are NOT usually on any best list:  Heathen, Small Axe, Who the Cap Fit, War, Get Up Stand Up, Johnny Was, Duppy Conqueror, Cry To Me, One Foundation.    If I was forced to pick his best song it would probably be "War."  Even though he didn't write the words and it is largely spoken, it is extremely powerful 
 I loved them at first..dainty and shiny..bought the black patent.  Hard to find flats that are stylish.  They ONLY LASTED 2 WEARS...and that was at a funeral and church..about 2-3 hours a time.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!!! The hole for the back strap stretched so big it's nearly ripped off and I was sitting nearly the entire time so how could this happen?!  I thought Nine West had quality shoes but DON'T BUY these 
 Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake). 
 Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I was looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed once I got it.  Several of the patterns were already in their previous books, and one of the others (the sheep shawl) is just four of the sheep scarf from a previous book that are then sewn together.  I have enjoyed most of the previous books from the "Vogue Knitting on the Go" series and expected more from this book, but it did not deliver 
 What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.   Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.   And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.   Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school.  
 A bookish English exchange student (Maxwell Caulfield) transforms himself into a "cool rider" in order to win the heart of a Pink Lady (Michelle Pfeiffer).  This sequel to the excellent "Grease" is simply embarrassing.  It pales to the original in every conceivable way.  The cast is painfully inadequate.  Even Pfeiffer shows little indication of the talent she would later prove to have.  A few of the musical numbers show promise, but the soundtrack consists mostly of stinkers like "Cool Rider" and "Who's That Guy."  Avoid this at all costs 
 I ordered this book to help teach the importance of telling the truth.  It was not the classic tale I remember.  I agree with the other review that the book seemed more violent and did not express the true intent of the original tale 
 I would have to disagree with the statement that Scary Movie 3 was the best movie ever made.  The movie was a complete mesh of other famous flicks, such as The Ring and Signs.  I wouldn't suggest that people would buy this movie because it's just humor thrown into odd places.  I've seen the movie five times, and although I laugh, it still isn't the greatest movie.  I'm just relieved that there wasn't as much language in this movie than in Scary Movie 2.  My God - they swore every other minute!  Anyway, buy The Ring or Signs if you want to see a really good movie 
 The photo shows a whole box of jars, but they're only selling one.  Don't be fooled by these jokers.  
 Anyone remember when she deep throated that bottle in her documentary? Yeah, I remember thinking, "Someday I hope to buy a childrens' book from her." And yeah, the book is as uninspiring as her others 
 This book was suggested to me by a dear friend. Though, the concept of servant leadership is strong, I am sure I don't want to read this book again to understand it.. 
 I bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy.  I then bought one for my daughter.  She used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit.  The blade assembly as per other reviews.  It is going to cost about $50. to repair.  Now mine is smelling.  I am using my old 15 year old Oster and it is still working.  Also to my surprise it is doing a better job.  Just not as pretty.  I have KA stand mixer, hand blender, food processors large and small, emersion blender and attachments for all.  Love all of them.  Will buy other KA but not this again 
 this movie is part Canadian soap opera and part effective slasher movie. The plot is a ripoff of THE PROWLER, or vice versa (either way, the prowler is a MUCH better movie, go see that instead). It deals with a vengeful wraith promising to spree if a valentine's party is ever held after a tragic holiday party-to-blame accident in a coal mine left one survivor to resort to cannibalism and unemployment. Of coarse you know them crazy kids  go and party anyways. Basically, anything to do with the killer miner or the mine itself is great, but everything else is just plain tacky. John Stanley of the Creature Features guide gave it 4 stars...I've decided that anything he says is good is automatically bad. I can't believe that a Band actually decided to ripoff this particular piece of pop culture to sell records. Its not because they were on drugs but because they were in the imagination-less state of NOT doing drugs 
 Nostalgia usually hits people with warm fuzzy feelings and this book has its share of them. All in all, I don't think the book quite hit its mark. I was entertained by a few stories but I was expecting much more since many of the reviews here had such high praise. I think the warm fuzzies that some people get by reading about their childhood memories overshadows the point that the book really isn't all that great. This is a great topic for a book and hopefully a better one will come along later 
 "Looking Backward" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth.  But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received.  Bellamy was 31 when this book was published.  As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep.  But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system.  Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates.  His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order.  These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words.  I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues.  And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston.  But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting?  We never find out, because he doesn't tell us.  In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires.  Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale.  He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings.  And there is a glaring error in his utopian world:  He does not take into account human nature.  He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more.  As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating.  Paraphrasing here:  Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.  With that, I agree.   
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 When I bought this book, intially I had an open mind about toilet training methods, but after reading this book I am sceptical about the child centred technique. The reasons outlined in the book have a circular logic which makes no sense to me. Also, some of the suggestions seemed just silly to me - for instance, the advice to change an active baby's dirty nappy in the bath while she pulls herself up and down!  Dr Brazelton outlines the reasons for changing to a child centred technique in the 60's  - to prevent the high occurrence of failure  from rigid early training schedules which involved punishment and shame. A much more rigorous study than the one which Dr Brazelton describes would have looked at age of training and use of punishment INDEPENDENTLY, and then drawn conclusions on what was causing the high failure rate. As the study was conducted it is impossible to conclude which of the two factors - early age or punishment- was more harmful.  Dr Brazelton gives a list of signs of readiness and then assumes that NO child will have these signs before the age of 2. I feel that this is greatly underestimating our children, and also patronising to other cultures around the world (who don't live in "our mainstream hygienic culture") who train their children at a much younger age.   I feel this book could be very confusing to parents as they endlessly wait for their child to exhibit ALL of the signs of readiness and NONE of the signs of not being ready. But some of the signs that a child is NOT ready could be due to waiting TOO long; for example,  1. A child sits on the toilet and then pees soon after standing up: This could also be to due the child having made a longstanding habit of peeing standing up which is possible in a diaper; 2. The child is not uncomfortable in a dirty diaper: This could also be because the child has been in diapers for so long, he has been conditioned to accept walking around with faeces smeared on his bottom!  Dr Brazelton strongly emphasizes that toilet training should be up to a child and that it is his achievement. Of course! No one else is in control of his muscles! Why then is this only possible after a certain age? In the book, he desribes how he pre-empts toilet training questions at the 12 and 18 month checkups and strongly advises parents not to start until after age 2. This to me smacks of interference well beyond what is appropriate between patient and doctor. No wonder parents are confused - they are told to ignore knowledge of their own child.  As a final note, I'm a bit tired of the hackneyed advice "Don't worry, your child won't be in diapers at college" that seems so prevalent from toilet training experts. More to the point is, "Will your child still be in diapers when he goes to SCHOOL?", which seems like a possibility if you endlessly wait for all the signs of readiness. Perhaps then your child could attend Dr Brazelton's Toilet school for untrained 4-6 year olds. 
 It was great while it lasted, but the garlic press handle broke off easily, and we had to replace it with a sturdier brand 
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 I have to be honest.  I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do.  I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals.  I still had to use a "cover-up" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the "flawless" look.  But then it looked too powdery.  I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy.  Just a note, my sister said she still uses a "Cover up stick" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it 
 There are many good thoughts and observations in this book, and I had high hopes for it initially. However, it reads like the publisher asked for 200 + pages and Dr. Weiss expanded her thoughts to fill the space allotted.  Although I hate abridged books generally, this one would be a great candidate for aggressive editing.  I'd love to see it boiled down to its essentials, but I'm not interested enough in the author's personal experiences to read the whole thing 
 This item was not very good,setup instructions poor, lighting poor, cannot view screen at night, forget it 
 I did not like this product at all. It is very hard to use and  too small 
 I agree with the people complaining about the poor CS policy at JVC. They let me down as well, when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built.  I am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid JVC in the future. I just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit. This will come back and bite them in the behind 
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 I have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about this film I remember enjoying. It's a cross between The Blob, The Thing and a really crap detective movie. Moriarty's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80's kiddy movie. This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you'll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it. No suspense, few laughs, and way to hokey to watch twice. If you love this movie you need to get out more. 
 Vladimir Nabokov is one of the great authors of the 20th century, both as a craftsman and stylist in the novel form. He even succeed in grand poetry (Pale Fire), so one would think that his literal translation of Oneigin would be a welcome publication. It's not. First, Nabokov strips Onegin of all poetics, which he admits is his intent. He believes the poem is better understood from a transliteral (almost interlinear) reading than from a poetic reconstruction. This attempt may please, and I stress "may," those who, unfamiliar with Russian, and who want such a bland diet of lackluster prose. But there are so many excellent translations of Onegin that are beautiful and captivating in themselves, I'm not sure there's much need for such a literal, word-for-word, transcription. Perhaps this book belongs on the shelf along with other translations of Onegin, but it's not one I'll return to in the near future 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 I was hoping to identify at least a few of the 11 different mushrooms in my garden.  Unfortunately not a single one is shown in the picture plates.  I am now in search of a better book 
 I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting.  I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected.  It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children.  Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending.  My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money

 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 I had high expectations for this book, but I was disappointed.  It concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  I lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish 
 I find that this unit spatters and sputters terribly when I make quantities of rice measuring 3 cups dry or more. It is a 10 cup cooked unit and I can't imagine making any larger quantities than I have. I use the right amount of rice and water. Water spills over onto my countertop and through the air hole. As it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop. What a mess! I threw away the packing materials or I would probably return it. I do like the non-stick pot and the keep warm feature. If anyone has any advice on how to keep this mess from happening, I would appreciate it 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 I recently bought this unit after returning 2 defective 9430 models by Cobra and I'll have to say there is no improvement as I had thought. My impression was 'pay more and get a better product' but in this case that is not true. This detector gave me nothing more than a series of false alarms or no alarms. When radar was detected correctly, it was either too late (less than 1/4 mile) or the alert signal did not increase as I approached the radar making me think it was another false alarm. Thankfully Cobra covers their units for one full year and it is on its way back for replacement. I will say that their customer service is much better than my luck with their radar detectors. I spoke to a live rep right away, something rare to get these days! A UPS postage paid sticker was sent right out to me. I hope the replacement unit works correctly 
 Generic, overproduced, commercial, mediocre emo. It's the pedal they use to make their non-distorted guitar parts sound like synths that I really hate. If you want to make synth music, play a synth. If you're going to play guitar, use it like a guitar, don't process it through an effect so you can make the most insipidly soothing and palatable sounds you possibly can, because the sound of an actual guitar is too abrasive for your wussy prettyboy ears. This band's existance disgusts me. 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body.  One of the few exercise videos that does this is the Firm's "Boomers." Too bad it's not available anymore 
 The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far 
 I got this puzzle for my  1 1/2 yr old.  The sound does not work so I'm basically considering this toy as defective.  I likely won't return it b/c I don't want to deal with the hassle 
 Very little to work with here.  Covers everything, but with little detail.  For instance, there are only six pages in the book on sub-contractors. Search a little more and you can find a different resource that will be much more detail oriented.   
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 If you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here.   But if you got yourself online to read this review then I doubt you will find this book much help. There were a few helpful ehows for me in the book though. For example I forgot exactly how to boil an egg. And there it was in the book. A typical type of ehow.   And this book is BIG and HEAVY. with most info ridiculously simple I would say the size to useful ratio is not that desirable.  Maybe this would make an ok high school graduation gift but other than that most people should avoid this book. The ehow website is great though and its FREE!.  
 The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).  Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway 
 I'm afraid this book has very little to recommend it. Not only is it out of touch with classical and contemporary literature on its subject of choice, all the master structures described aren't really plot structures either, but rather smaller narrative "motifs". And where are all the illustrative, helpful examples from literature and film to flesh out the descriptions? Probably in some other book.  For a well-researched, expansive, and empirically grounded take on basic plot structures, I recommend Christopher Booker's "The Seven Basic Plots" 
 I was expecting something much more specific and focused from this book. It's not really about 'habits' of designers at all, methinks.   Lynch should really have edited out several of the comments included here - such as: 'Lighting is essential. it is the most versatile tool we have for creating an atmosphere'.  This is an aphorism, Ms Lynch. Not a habit, not even a suggestion. It tells the reader nothing that s/he can use to improve her/his living space. Which, one may be forgiven for thinking, is the whole point of a book purporting to reveal designers' practices.    Having said this, some designers do make useful suggestions. Example from the same chapter: 'make sure lights are not directly overhead, it creates raccoon eyes. Chandeliers, sconces and lamps ..are sure to make people look good...Of course,  a dimmer is a must'. This comment is not a statement of principle (you can't move sideways through this book for the vapid 'be true to/trust yourself' statements); the designer is telling us something she looks out for, a habit I can emulate myself. Lynch should have concentrated on this kind of comment to produce a useful book, rather than just a coffee-table book with some nice pictures and a few good points.   Incidentally, it's obvious that some of the designers quoted are represented throughout the book (in terms of photographs) by one project only,  and others by several. Shouldn't there have been some consistency here 
 As an adult, I liked the story - but don't think it's appropriate for a child. I think most children would conclude that wolves are evil and scary (the illustrations of the wolf are certainly scary). Since I live a stone's throw from wolf country, this book is probably not the best bedtime reading for my child. Sent it back. 
 In "God Knows", Joseph Heller attempts to tell the story of King David through arrogant eyes.  Rather than finding David intelligent or witty, I just found him annoying.  In a long book, this is not a good thing.  The story seems verbose while lacking the strong social commentary of Heller's other works.  The attempts at humor made throughout the book missed the target for me because the characters were beyond my liking.  While I did find the occasional snicker on some pages, I found myself wishing for the pain to end.  The endless jokes about circumcision were almost as painful as the operation itself.  I have enjoyed Heller's other books including "Catch-22" and "Something Happpened".  To me, this book just missed the mark which may be why this is not one of his better known works.  Others may enjoy this book, but it is certainly not for everybody 
 I am a long-time Derailers fan but can't listen to them since the departure of Tony Villanueva.  Don't get me wrong, Brian Hofeldt is a talented singer and is very charismatic but without Tony it just doesn't work for me 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!! After 12 books its still not over, my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this! (and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 I bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new Fodor's isn't out yet. This has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations, but isn't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins. the maps are not comprehensive enough (the one for modern jerusalem  didn't cover a third of the city, and the one for tel aviv was tiny), and there is not enough practical information about food, hotels, and getting from place to place. I was disappointed. 
 I loved Gilbert's "Remote Feed" and was eager to read this novel, but by pg. 140 I simply couldn't continue.  The wise-guy prose, the elaborate language describing nothing, the John Irving "Hotel New Hampshire" madness forced on the proceedings and the most bland, ridiculous characters imaginable -- it's all absurd, silly, unbelievable.  Great novels are about truth.  This novel is an empty farce.   I see a young and promising author turned vainglorious.  While acknowledging that Martin Amis has made this pose a career, I wish Gilbert would try for more 
 I was disappointed with the book. It was not as helpful for the small, individual investor as I wanted it to be. $10,000 spread over 50 stocks means investing $200 per stock without even talking about any fees for buying and selling 50 different stocks. So from this book I can narrow down my indivual selection of stocks to 25 or 50, but if I only want to purchase 3-5 stocks how do I decide which 3-5 of the 50 to buy?   The book did give me a broader understanding of the different strategies used behind mutual funds. When I review a mutual fund's strategy, now I know the lingo and what the fund manager is looking for in a stock and how that strategy compares to other strategies. So I think the book has made me a better mutual fund shopper, but has not helped me as much in purchasing individual stocks 
 Mr Hammond refers favorably to the impossible claims of Milton Erickson.  In fact Erickson's published accounts of his cases involve impossible-to-believe coincidences and improbabilities that raise the question:  How come nobody else has ever claimed such results? (see Hypnotism Then and Now, p. 119) Robert Baker disproved hypnotism in spades. (see They Call It Hypnosis) And in The Disinformation Cycle, p. 40, I wrote,"If hypnotism existed, somebody would have proven it by now.  Hypnotism has never been demonstrated to exist, and almost certainly does not exist."  Anyone who thinks otherwise should ask himself:  How come the one incontrovertible demonstration of hypnotism's reality, that could not be explained away as playacting, self-delusion or "trying harder," remains as unattainable today as it was in Anton Mesmer's time? As with all other paranormal and pseudo-medical delusions, believers in hypnotism tend to be impervious to an infinite amount of evidence that all credible positive results are attributable to the placebo effect.  This book is useful to any humbug who wishes to prey on the gullible by claiming abilities that do not exist 
 If you are looking for a Catholic Bible, this is not the one for you.  This Bible does not include the Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha 
 I picked up this book, having thoroughly enjoyed the last 2 editions and was greatly disappointed by the story selection this year.  In the past the selections have all had only one thing in common: they are some of the best pieces of "writing" in the past year.   This year there seems to be a theme of nothing but depression.  Story after story seems to be nothing but how bad life is and how there is nothing you can do to get around it.  Reading this book is akin to watching French films all day then calling your mom and asking her "whats wrong?".  The light at the end of the tunnel is a hilarious story from Sedaris about a rousing night of strip poker.  Very funny stuff and is just about the only reason I give this book 2 stars.  
 A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into "fun." Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook 
 I have been reading several good guides to the Montessori method, including one volume from the library I was able to get written by Montessori herself.  I was hopeful that this book by Lillard would give good sound advice for practical current infant Montessori techniques based on a sound knowledge of Montessori.  Unfortunately this was not the case.    My biggest complaint regarding this book was the disregard shown to infant well being.  Leaving an infant alone for extended periods of time is not advisable and can be dangerous.  I had a very large objection to her advice that infants should be weaned at 9 months whether the infant seemed "ready" or not.  That certainly does not seem to be respecting an infant's innate intelligence.  Then there was the potty training at 12 months advice.  Well that may be great if your child is showing signs of readiness, it would not be advisable for the many many infants who are simply not developmentally ready at that stage.  Those ideas of the author are in direct conflict with Montessori principles of giving children materials for their developmental readiness.  Not all children will be ready then and forcing them as the author seems to suggest will not likely lead to positive results.    There are much better guides out there and this one I simply cannot recommend as it is harsh and gives an impression of Montessori principles that is not truly accurate in many instances.  
 Have you ever heard how an artist has a particular strength and weakness? For example, being able to draw really good faces, but not-so-good hands or feet? I feel that Ian Irving is like that -- he writes a good, entertaining read (obviously, since I am going through book #4), but his "weakness" is character development, particularly romances. I know romance plays a pretty prominent role in most fantasy and sci-fi books, but this is not Irving's strong point. The romances seem shallow, improbable, and rushed. I had a hard time enjoying the story because of them. But as other readers have mentioned, there is "something" about the books that make you coming back for more.  So what is Irving's strong point? Food descriptions -- pay attention to every meal mentioned in the books. You will learn the texture of cheese, the ripeness of fruit, the grains in every bread mentioned, etc., etc. It's almost humorous how much detail goes into food, but not character development.   If I had any advice to give, it would be for Irving to to write a cookbook, or perhaps a Zagats review or two. I'm sure they would be captivating, and right up his alley. 
 There comes a point in every conversation about terrorism with liberals when they announce, with the all of the smug assurance of the possessor of a great and secret knowledge, "America is the greatest terrorist state in history". I've never quite believed in this theory and have always felt that it was so obviously untrue that it didn't require refutation. As real terrorism increases and this mantra is no longer being chanted solely by the dim but earnest but has even penetrated to the sub-plankton of the intellectual food-chain, I feel that the lie that will not die deserves its day in court.   Perhaps the foremost proponent of the theory of America as a terrorist state is William Blum, author of "Rogue State" a book recommended by no less a personage than that great modern master of terror, Osama bin-Laden. I'm using mainly this work as evidence for the prosecution. As evidence for the defence I will be calling on history, logic and common sense.  I'm not claiming that Blum's book is factually incorrect; in fact Blum is an impressive collector of facts and statistics, it's just that Blum never seems to have learned the meaning of a little thing called "context". As the poet Blake said, "A truth that's told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent". In this instance Blum's ignorance of context involves amnesia about a violent internationalist ideology that still blights the lives of millions of Cubans, Chinese and Koreans. If you are thinking "Communism" give yourself a nice big gold five-pointed star. In almost every one of the conflicts described by Blum America was intervening to prevent the spread of Communism. In this respect America has been the victim of its own success. America did prevent the spread of Communism and because of this we never get to see how most of these countries would have turned out under the governance of the various ragbag of revolutionary movements that were suppressed. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, we have both living examples and historical evidence to take into consideration and I'm guessing that in most cases we can lean towards Pol Pot rather than Fidel Castro. Behind every one of Blum's carefully quantified death tolls falls a shadow; the shadow of a vastly greater narrowly averted Communist death toll   Doing a quick calculation based on "Rogue State" I can find no more than five million victims of "American terrorism". The soviets managed to kill ten million people in the Ukraine alone. That's twice as many victims in one single communist atrocity than occurred throughout the entire period of post-WWII American hegemony. Mao Tse Tung killed sixty million people without even going to war. For a more up to date example, let's consider the Marxist president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe. Since his ascent to power Mugabe has presided over an economic collapse spectacular even by African standards. This has mainly been caused by his racist assault on his nation's White minority and attempted genocide of his rival tribe. The Communist miracle has transformed Zimbabwe from a peaceful and prosperous nation into a country of rape camps and drains blocked by murdered infants and aborted foetuses. Still, he really stuck it to Whitey, so I suppose in Blum's eyes that makes the misery of millions of Black Zimbabweans acceptable.   Did I mention Fidel Castro? Blum claims that America's hostility to Cuba was based on the fact that, "Cuba had carried out The Unforgivable Revolution, a very serious threat of setting a "good example in Latin America". So it had nothing to do with Cuba's collaboration with a hostile enemy power and its willingness to be used as an offshore nuclear missile base then?  According to Blum, "The saddest part of this is that the world will never know what kind of society Cuba could have produced if left alone, if not constantly under the gun and the threat of invasion, if allowed to relax its control at home. The idealism, the vision, the talent were all there. But we'll never know". Yes indeed! We'll never know. I'd suggest that Blum uses some of the royalties from his book to take a vacation in North Korea. A short period of starvation might stimulate his imagination. Blum might even want to consider how Cuba might have turned out if its threadbare economy hadn't been propped up by Russia and China for half a century.  Post WWII America was confronted by a superpower whose sworn objective was America's destruction. To achieve this end the Communists fomented and funded revolutionary coups throughout the world. To suppress Communism the US sometimes supported people who did very bad things. Blum doesn't care to expound upon the equally bad thing done by their opponents. Call me old fashioned but I call that bias. Blum is also wrong in his allegation that the US is solely responsible for the atrocities committed in places like Nicaragua. Yes, America did train Para-military forces but, unless Blum can show me the manuals, I refuse to believe that it trained them to rape and torture civilians. Skinning civilian faces was something that the natives invented all by themselves. It seems that because the Communists ultimately failed they are also absolved, in Blum's mind, of all guilt. If the Communists had succeeded in their forced conversion of Africa and Latin America it is possible, perhaps even probable, that the end of the last century may have witnessed the collapse of Capitalism and not of Communism. Some persistent left-liberals will argue that this would have been a good thing. None of these liberals choose to live in one of the worlds remaining Communist states. Now isn't that funny? 
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 Major disappointment. Maynard's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his band-mates into this pile of dung just because he can. Not only was this album/DVD completely rushed and way less-than-perfected, I found it odd that in a chat with Maynard on October 29, 2003 he stated the following regarding the 13th Step, "I'm not thinking about that right now. I'm on the delivery table crowning ... breathing hard ... delivering my new baby ... and you're asking me if I'm going to have another baby someday". But yet eMOTIVe was rushed to be released in time for 2004 elections.   Maybe Mr. Keenan should heed his own advice: "You are ALWAYS responsible for your own actions, so choose them wisely". 
 I was a real fan of the series when it originally aired and have continued watching it in reruns on cable stations.  I purchased the first season at a local discount store, so when I found the second season on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy it.  I still enjoy the program, but the quality of these DVD's is questionable.  Very often while viewing them, the picture is scrambled (similar to a bad satellite signal).  This greatly reduces my plesaure in viewing the DVD's.  So much so that if I could easily return them, I would 
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 Saying  that Abraham reconciles the three religions is like saying Adam reconciles special creation and evolution.  Unfortunately, for Feiler, those who deny that Jesus is Messiah, God, eternally separate themselves from the christian faith.  Jews and Muslims can only  be  reconciled to Jesus by accepting Jesus as Savior and Lord, not  by playing games with Abraham. 
 This WOULD be a great space-saver . . . but now that Gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars, we never used it AT ALL!!  Now Gerber makes their own Feeding Center to accommodate their tubs, and I LOVE it 
 I purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew.  When it arrived, I opened the book to the middle and I could not believe what I was looking at.  One of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated.  Blood is spewing from the headless neck, his necklace is falling in one direction, and his separated head (with a horror/surprise look on his face) is falling to the ground behind the horse.  This is very gruesome, and there is no way I could give this as a gift a child of any age.  Wondering what could be worse, I turned the page to find another battle scene.  One man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow.  I am not making this up, the head is split open and details are painted.  Many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos.  I look at the next artwork, and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife.  Why would someone pick these art works?  Why would the editors allow them?  I'm still stunned that this would make it print. 
 I wish that I could have sampled this selection prior to it's purchase. There may be some entries that might be good for sampling, but I got no goosebumps listening to it. DJ Shadow has some wonderfully creative grooves out there.....just not on this disc. 
 I  think  this  book  is  very  boring  and  I've got   a  little  bit  tired  with  the  plot  and  the  characters.  I   found  this  book  extremely  difficult   to  continue  reading. Also the book  is  full  of  inconsistencies. But  I  think  there  are  many  good  ideas and  themes  in  this  book,  but  they none  developed. I  don't  recommend  this  book  at  all. Not  only  a  story  unsatisfying,  but  the  writing  style  is  extremely  annoying  as  well 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 The author uses a lot of words to describe something that could be said in much fewer words.  He has a very difficult reading style 
 It is distressing to see how many people are fooled into believing that one can awaken consciousness in a healthy way through lust and desire.  This method clearly contradicts the teachings of Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, Tsong Khapa, the current Dalai Lama, etc.  I encourage anyone who is seeking positive spiritual enlightenment to look at the teachings of these Masters, along with others who proved the virtuous sincerity of their hearts: Eliphas Levi, Swami Sivananda, Dion Fortune, Rudolf Steiner, H.P. Blavatsky, and Samael Aun Weor.  Do not be misled by the tempting serpent; to awaken positively, you must CONQUER him 
 Reading like the "educational materials" that were provided to me as a student in East Germany (DDR)this short text is heavy on Marxist jargon and ideological arguments by assertion and fairly useless as an analysis of the genuinely troubling problem of "Permanent War and Americanization of the World" emblazened on the cover.  Ultimately the text hardly touches on these issues accept as symptoms of Western liberalism.  While I share Amin's assessment of the foundations and limits of liberalism and the "market", I find much of his argument intellectually flaccid, problematized by his misunderstanding of Post-Modernism and his predisposition to certain outcomes regardless of how thin the argument is stretched to reach those conclusions.  One such example is his meaninglessly derisive inclusion of Israel in a discussion of the "Triad" (USA, Europe and Japan) while leaving out the PR China, perhaps also for ideological reasons, despite China's massive and highly exploitative economy.  In the end, Amin is clearly preaching to the choir and in the "Latin" of the orthodoxy at that.  Despite an enticing cover and provocative blurb, the book ends up being the same tired and disappointing Marxist ad hominem discourse, providing solutions like "Europe should and can liberate itself from the liberal virus. However, this inititiative cannot come from the segments of dominant capital, but must come from the people." (p.108)Not so helpful, Comrade 
 Failure to Launch was quite of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates among others. A 35 year-old man's parents plot to have their son move out of the house (!) by hiring a professional who feigns interest in him... In short, the acting is generally pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is above average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The major setbacks are in relation to: 1) The weak plot and especially the weak dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.  Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates were given weak lines.  What a waste of a good cast! 2) The whole "nephew" issue was just ridiculous! 3) The whole naked father thing... 4) Parents plotting to get rid of their child is absurd. On a positive note, Zooey Deschanel is delightful as Kit.  Let's see more of her... Though the potential for a decent movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers. In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it.  Wait till they show it on TV. 
 I was surprised to see that my grandmother, who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance, who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give, was completely villified by this book... because she is a christian. I dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book. 
 there are a lot of original and wonderful flavor ideas.  many of the recipies are quite pricey to make due to the liberal use of dutch cocao powder.  the basic cake recipie on which most of the cupcakes are based makes a rather dry cake that has a rough texture.  the basic frosting recipie is too dense.  i like the flavors but not the recipies.  i have adapted the basic cake and frosting recipie making the end products much lighter and airier, with good results 
 This textbook is so long winded. When it tells personal stories related to the topics, it is very interesting. However, when it gets technical, boy does it get technical. It seems as if it wants to confuse the reader on purpose. The index is worthless. For example, a question on the test will ask about the Neur men, look for Neur in the index and you get nothing. However, it is in the book. The glossary is just a contnuation of the confusing overly technical speak this book does too well.  Bottom line, if you have a decent prof. then this book will suffice, otherwise be prepared to feel like you are being tortured for the secret rocket code. 
 I took me 3 months to get thru this boring book.I thought would have some exciting stuff.  Just some dumb stories about how some kid got his dads football team and some dumb BS stories with some underworld king. Hated it...   A  
 Do not buy this product or any other product with the Perfect Pour Carafe.  The brilliant designers at Black & Decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe.  The problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over.  Nice work guys.  One call to their Customer Service line was cut off.  On the next I chose the option to leave a message and be called back--unfortunately the mailbox was full.  I guess the poor product deserves poor customer service 
 I did not think this was an appropriate book for my 5 year old son.  It talked in some detail about eating the liver and lung of Snow White.  It ends with a description of the demise of the Queen, "But they had  already put iron slippers over a fire of coals, and they brought them in  with tongs and set them before her.  Then she had to put on the red hot  slippers and dance till she dropped down dead."  Need I say more?   This is not for small children!  The pictures are beautiful giving the book  a few stars, but there are only pictures on every other spread.  My son  continued to try to turn the page while I was reading the pages with only  words while I am trying to anticipate what to skip over 
 This was Rand's first work of nonfiction, and it is supposed to be an introduction to her philosophy of Objectivism. But it is certainly not the best place to start. The book consists of one rather lengthy essay, followed by excerpts from her four novels. As expected, more pages are devoted to excerpts from Atlas Shrugged than to any of the other novels - in fact, than to all of the others put together. Galt's seventy-plus page speech is included in its entirety.  Unfortunately, the excerpts aren't as interesting outside the context of the novels. Even worse, the title essay is probably the weakest Rand ever wrote. In it, Rand attempts to explain all of history in terms of the two types of men who have dominated it, Attila and the Witch Doctor. Attila represents those who have ruled men by force, whereas the Witch Doctor represents the irrational mystics who have controlled men's minds. The whole thing is just plain ridiculous.  If you want to know what Rand thought, you'd be better off starting with The Virtue of Selfishness, followed by Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. 
 Pan received wil not be pan pictured.  Pan will look like Kaiser Bakeware Nobless 7-inch springform pan, model#751603.  Pan sent will have correct item#51842 on label from nordicware.  
 it requires effort from owners.  Bought this to help control our Sheltie's barking behavior.  When we first tried it, he would stop and look around to see where the sound was coming from.  We noticed that this alone wouldn't stop his bark and required us to work with him by using voice commands like 'No' or 'Quiet'. This  meant alot of time and patience working with him and my kids didn't help very much.  They have a tendency to push the button and not do the commands.  So now the dog thinks that the sound comes from the birds that he likes to bark at...lots of re-training to do here.  Well the dog hasn't stopped barking and obeying yet, but we haven't been as good at working with him either.  My next purchase will probably be a Citronella Collar..I'm opposed to the shock treatment from shock collars as this seems cruel and can teach some dogs to be mean.  Better still maybe a good book on dog training is in order.   My oldest daughter used this when walking the dog around the neighborhood and found that it did stop some of the neighbor's dogs from barking or at least got their attention.  My question now is could this possibly stop or delay a dog attack??...at least long enough to get away or somehow protect yourself.   Not sure I would want to risk trying this though but it might be worth taking on walks..just in case.  
 Reads more like a blog-rant than a book.  The author bends facts to meet her view of reality.  Her agenda is clear from the start.  If she understood the references she quotes it would be a better book.  
 This film is basically about drugs and killing. I did not really find a plot behind it. I did have a story but it was not a very strong one. I kind of like 50 Cent so I thought that it was going to be an ok movie. I was wrong. I do not hold the same respect for 50 cent that I have because I cannot beleive that he starred in such a meaningless film.  The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did want to see what happened in the end, so I watched it and payed attention. Other than that, I hopefully will never see this film again. 
 Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription 
 If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..."   There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.    This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.   
 I am sure that this book will serve the needs of most of the buyers as a competent treatment of the subject area. I am studying for the exam and wanted two things: A large set of practice questions for drill purposes (the cd had 30 questions) and a portable reference copy of the book. The ebook included can only by read from the cd according to the text file that comes with it, but in fact for me the book was totally unreadable from the CD on a PC or a Mac with serveral different versions of the adobe reader that I tried. I am not interested in reading a 900 page book just to pass an exam and found that the dummies book plus the testking questions were enough. This book did not suit my needs at all 
 After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.   
 I've been to Italy several times.....Rome, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Milan, some of the hill towns, etc.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide   
 What is this book about? Whale revenge? What is that? I read the whole book and all they do is ride around in a boat. And there's a whale. And they kill it. This is basically Moby Dick for kids. I'm guessing the whale is the main character as none of the characters are memorable. I don't fault the author, but what editor allowed this book to sneak by? I guess somebody who likes whales a real lot 
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
  This movie started off with a promising atmosphere which hinted at fun and thrills to come, but is let horribly down by laughable special effects, paper-thin cliché'd characters and some cringingly awful acting.  The students (blonde bimbo, geeky nerd and sincere young thing with a crush on the stereotypical workaholic prof) heading off in their jeep into the wilderness certainly had potential, but any attempts to build a creepy atmosphere of isolation is diluted and spoiled by the intrusion of the weak and pointless sub-plot about an army special forces unit battling against insurgents.  This military operation (think Arnie's team in Predator meets the marines in Aliens) gives Coolio the stage to strut his stuff. But, I'm sorry to say, convincing he ain't.  Obliged to join forces with the students, the remainder of the film is basically a series of action set-pieces in which the humans battle it out with the pterodactyls. The ensuing gore is laid on in a very OTT style reminiscent of the Evil Dead series (but nowhere near as stylish) and creates a few (unintended?) laughs.  The 18 rating is certainly undeserved too - there are far more effective and scary 15's out there.  Even as straight to DVD `B' movies go, this is pretty poor fare. The final scene hints at a sequel - they really shouldn't bother 
 From the reviews I had read about this book, it was supposed to be an intellectual, highly appealing and enchanting updated version of a classic children's story in which the dwarves are not really dwarves but rather sexually charged men who each take their turns having sex with Snow White in the shower (and only the shower, never in a bed). Snow White is seeking her Prince Charming, whose name is Paul. The wicked stepmother, whose name is Jane, is out to get Snow White. And one of the "dwarves", Bill, doesn't like to be touched...by anyone. Other than that, there wasn't much else I understood about this book. It was a very disjointed book. The writing was stilted and had the feel of a foreigner speaking in a second language. The conversations were completely unrealistic and the voices in my head, while reading, kept on speaking in a mechanical drone; no expression or hint of emotions. Really, really, really, wasn't worth the three evenings I spent reading it. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has read and understood this book, but I certainly would not recommend purchasing it 
 I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it 
 I agree with Jeff.  The overuse of the "N" word was unnecessary and racist, and Ruth Yancey Fox ruining life after life for over 300 pages was just about too much to endure 
 Maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Mason-Dixon line (that would be north of Jackson, Mississippi) to appreciate the humor in this book, but I didn't find it all that funny.  With the exception of a few ancedotes this book was disappointing and did not live up to the rave reviews I'd heard about it.  Some of the advice handed out in this book was good (I agree with the author regarding toupees on men).  A couple of the anecdotes were side-splittingly funny (such as the one about the Queens most-prepared woman award).  Even a couple of the comfort-food recipes sounded good (the chocolate pudding in particular).  But overall this comes off as just a bunch of frustrated women over-40, who need therapy because they never got majorette boots as children.  Personally, I had a difficult time finishing this book and don't care to read any of the subsequent books that have been written by Ms. Browne.  As she explains how the Queens came to be, she attempts to draw you in with some "good girl talk" to make you feel part of the gang.  The author turned me off with her definition of the Sweet Potato Queens as an exclusive sorority with it's group of wannabes, who supposedly grovel and beg to become a Queen.  Give me a break!  Even if this was meant to be funny, it wasn't. It was just pathetic.  My good, sound advice to you on this book -- save your money and don't buy it.  
 Very loud, very slow - takes almost as long to inflate as when using a foot pump 
 According to Eastwood's friend, Richard Schickel, Eastwood is an auteur.  There is a lot of Eastwood-butt kissing going on in this laughable "authorized" biography.  That's to be expected but it is too over the top.  The strange thing is that Schickel get's his facts screwed up on the films as if he has only seen them once and a long time ago.  Was the editor asleep at the wheel?  After the bomb of Eastwood's  "Blood Work", I think that people do not care, anyway 
 Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals 
 I purchased the item listed below as a Christmas present so it was not opened until now.  the disc 1 shadow of the wolf has no data on it.  ASIN: B000BPL2IS Price Paid: $56.08 Condition: New  
 This is 5th edition of the book written in early 90th (first edition was in 1994). The book did not change much since. This is fuzzy, politically correct and watered down presentation of the subject. For example when you learn about cognitive dissonance you are not told that the original Festinger experiment was connected with the behavior of a flood doomsday cult after the target date of the flood passed.    This might be an OK book as a second of third book for self-education (you can save money buying any previous edition, but in no way this should be your first or only book on the subject), but this can be a horror show if this is your standard textbook at the university 101 Social physiology course and you need to pass an exam.  Here the inability of the authors to distinguish between important and unimportant will hunt you down.   The authors are too fond of  abusing "social-psychology-speak" and introduce too many pseudo-scientific terms without real necessity: it looks like they try artificially inflate both themselves and the subject by immersing trivial notions in obscure jargon. This infatuation with jargon, on the level completely unacceptable for the introductory course is one of the worst features of the book. It especially evident are summaries which are the Achilles spot of the book: badly written, badly thought-out, somewhat detached from the chapters content, horribly structured and weakly typeset.   The other problem with this book as an introductory (101 type) book is that it is just too big. Story-telling approach that authors use is not bad per se, but inability of authors to distinguish between really important and entertaining psycho-trivia distracts the reader. Their recently introduced multi-cultural approach adds to political correctness, but also adds to the volume.   If you are a student it is very difficult textbook to learn from. It provides an ample opportunity for a professor to create a test consisting of dozens of  hair-splitting terminology abusing questions.  You can never be sure that the detail you missed is really unimportant. You need to memorize all definitions and most of the experiments mentioned it the chapter (you might benefit from creating a Rolodeck of experiments mentioned in the book) and using the website tests to prepare. Please note that sample tests provided on website can be perfect for killing any further interest in social psychology in probably 80% of students :-)   I would like to reiterate it again that the main weakness of the book is the author inability to distinguish between really important material and trivial or supplementary material as well as almost complete absence of connections between chapters. Actually chapters can be read in a random order. There are many descriptions of both good and petty/questionable experiments without authors distinguishing between a few critical, ground-braking experiments and regular mass of  pseudo-psychological junk experiments.   Absence of CD with summaries and self-tests in inexcusable for a book with such a price, but the website is not bad (if you can find it ;-)   Typesetting of the book is weak and reflects authors complete absence of attention to structuring the material in a way that helps learners. The good thing is that definitions are put on the margins; the bad thing is that is some chapters (for example Ch 5) there just  too many definitions. Typesetting of summaries is just horrible: huge solid blocks of text with few bold typeface word/sentences.   Although I am not a professional in the field, my impression is that for self-study there are better books, both more interesting and better organized. From a few that I browsed John Sabini's textbook looks like a better deal: more interesting contents with higher dose of relevant to student's life staff. Douglas T. Kenrick textbook contains CD and looks better structured.  
 "Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU 
 I truly believe all of the ideas in the book are junk food for a moment. 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 I bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs.  It works for a while then stops working, or just goes on warm.  They replaced it three times--everytime it went out.  This seems to be common with cheap rice cookers--see the reviews on the RIVAL RCS 200, they all go out within days or weeks!  I guess Black and Decker and Rival used the same Chinaman to design these useless things.  I can't understand why Amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do NOT work.  The companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately. In frustration I bought the Aroma 60-cupper for $125--and after two months that also went out.  Any suggestions on a 20-cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated 
 Did you know that Eminems favorite song is #9 on the "MAKAVELI" album 
 My husband and I found these cases for our new SLVRs and were excited.  Unfortunatly, like others, we have found that they don't fit our phones.  We have the right style SLVR, the case just doesn't fit 
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 I expected more from Jack Davis - his other books I truly enjoyed.  But after waiting several months for this release, I am disappointed. I was hoping for a whole new batch of tricks fro my bag.  A while back, I bought th One Click Wow for Photoshop v7.  Now two iterations of Photoshop later, the CS2 version of One Click is almost idential, verbatim, to the old one.  Pictures, effects, text and all!  I wish there were some warning from the author or Amazon that this was the same book with a few pages and an updated title.  It's not that the content isn't great - if this is your only book in the One Click series.  If you want great effects that are quick and spectacular, this is the book.  If you already own a One Click book for Photoshop, spend your money on a Kelby book 
 Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else.  The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most.  If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 Verne's publisher called this "lackluster and lifeless," so it was locked up in a safe and never released.  Reading it, I can understand why. The characters are boring and predictable, and the dialogue is flat. Verne's vision of the future is not particularly intriguing.  Really, this book is only worth reading for Verne's sometimes prophetic predictions. He imagines the elevator, the automobile and fax machines, for example.  Not horrible, but not up to the standard I expect from Verne 
 This reads like a book rushed into print not long after war in Iraq was declared officially over by the President.  As noted by others here, much of it is pastiche history of the agency seemingly slapped together rather haphazardly.  The rest of it is a genuflection to Georges Tenet and Bush.  What caught my eye is that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are a given in the author's view up until second to last chapter, where their absence is dismissed rather cavalierly 
 The CD is great... sound good on the preview, still waiting for the CD to arrive.  I haven't receive my delivery after ordered it more than a month ago, only an e-mail asking me to review the product and there is no response from Amazon regarding the delivery or delay, am I wasting money here? 
 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 I know I was supposed to find Jim Lynch's debut novel, "The Highest Tide," wonderous(!), and magical(!) and mystical(!).  Surely, the diminutive precocious hero of the book, young Miles O'Malley (who has a particular knack for finding odd sea life on his late night strolls along the beach of the Puget Sound) is irresistible(!), and inspirational(!).  As you can tell from my sarcasm, none of it really worked for me.  It's not that I really despised the book -- it's just that I don't like when an author tries to awe me on every other page.  By about the middle of the book, I started getting pretty bored with not only Miles, but also with his rough-around-the-edges air guitar playing side-kick, Phelps; the totally messed up love of his life, Angie; and his best friend, the elderly, new age spouting, prophetic, Florence.  The last described character especially annoyed me, in the way her off the wall predictions always came true.  I guess we have to trust the author's depiction about the sea-life that he describes.  I don't know about you, but I'm not about to start researching the sex lives of barnacles, clams and mussels for verification purposes.  Although, I admit it would be kind of neat to find a giant squid washed up on the beach.   
 The use of the word "superstition" in the title is a mistake, and one that captures the problem with the whole argument.  The book is meant as a rebuttal to E.O. Wilson's book Consilience, which argues for an expansion of the use of the scientific method into the realm of the Humanities.  A superstition is a belief that one holds without any supporting evidence or in spite of evidence to the contrary.  Some examples would include believing that bad things are more likely to happen on Friday the 13th, that the Earth is 6000 years old, or that water can be located with a bent twig.  The human mind is so susceptible to superstition that people had to devise a method of constantly checking their beliefs against observations.  That's science -- the thing that rescues you from superstition.  I have to believe that anyone who thought seriously about the scientific method would be OK with it.  After all it's just away of keeping oneself honest.  In this book Wendell Berry seems particularly angry about something called "scientism," a silly word meant to criticize those who place undue faith in the scientific method.  Berry's argument is that there are aspects of human existence that are outside the realm of science, and to think otherwise is to engage in superstition.  But he's wrong.  Science is a tool for figuring out how things work, and people use it because it has time and again proven successful in solving mysteries that seemed impenetrable, even deeply spiritual.  In other words people use science to solve problems because centuries of evidence have shown it to be the best way to solve problems.  One might as well use the word "carpentism" to describe the belief that patios can be made out of wood and nails.  Beyond carping about what can be studied, Berry really wants to limit the things that should be studied.  I have to say I find this kind of creepy.  He talks a lot about his sense of wonder at the beauty of his Kentucky farm, but what about people who derive a sense of wonder from the mathematical structure of music or the brain circuitry that gives rise to religious experience?  I can think of no objective reason why farms are more beautiful than equations, or poetry more beautiful than synapses.  And suppose our knowledge of synapses could improve people's lives.  Suppose we could use a rigorous understanding of the biological basis of thoughts and emotions to treat schizophrenia (one of the world's leading causes of human misery).  I know of no other way to investigate the way the brain works, and no reason why such suffering is not worth alleviating.  The book also complains a great deal about the abuses of science by politicians and corporations.  As several other reviewers have pointed out, his legitimate beef here is with the government, not science.  Governments were abusing their subjects long before there was any such thing as science, and they will continue to do so as long as their corruption is unchecked.  The U.S. is (for the moment) a democracy that is responsive to the will of the people, and the laws regulating industry can be changed far more easily than the laws of physics 
 Despite impressive research, Cait Murphy's "Crazy '08," an anecdotally-rich exploration of the excruciatingly exciting pennant races in the major leagues in1908, strikes out.  This is an egregiously written work, lacking both grace and coherence.  At times, the style is so discursive, so unprofessional and so trite as to make the reader wince at its lack of polish.  Fans and scholars never tire of discussing baseball's enduring impact on our national character; the sport has encouraged involvement in everything from fantasy leagues to university courses.  At its best, baseball is timeless, and works that treat the sport with critical dignity and academic integrity become timeless as well.  "Crazy '08," which lacks dignity, diligence and sincerity, is destined never to make the big leagues of baseball scholarship.  At best, it's a bush-league book.   Murphy's thesis is that 1908 was "the greatest year in baseball history."  Both the National and American Leagues had three-way pennant races, and the National League's conclusion (featuring a climactic one-game showdown at the Polo Grounds between the New York Giants and the Chicago Cubs) signaled the sport's coming-of-age.  Giving relatively short shrift to the American League and virtually ignoring the overshadowed World Series, Murphy focuses her attention on the bitter rivalry between the Cubs and the Giants.  Storied participants receive proper attention, and even the most casual of baseball fan will recognize the "Peerless Leader," Frank Chance, manager of the Cubs, and his violent, combative and arrogant Giant adversary, John McGraw.  Christy Mathewson, Honus Wagner, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, "Three-Finger" Mordecai Brown and Fred Merkle receive Murphy's loving attention.  Detail is the author's strength.  The 1908 season was one where two teams could decide to play an entire game using only one ball.  It was a time when a love-struck catcher, desiring to spend some time with his wife and being refused a day off from his manager, deliberately catches a fastball with his index finger (and consequently mashing it).  Ballplayers came to the park drunk, played with a level of violence shocking to modern sensibilities and vilified, tormented and fought umpires on a regular basis.  They traveled by train, earned far less than they deserved (though much more than the brutal manual labor jobs many of them escaped) and played the game with remarkable grace.  Unfortunately, Murphy elects to include a series of essays (ranging from prostitution in Chicago to the rise and fall of anarchism), some of which I'm guessing, she wrote as college research papers.  The level of analysis is sophomoric.  Whenever she poses a difficult question (such as why so many ballplayers committed suicide in the early twentieth century), she rarely bothers to construct any kind of reasonable analysis.  Dismissive of her readers, she even concludes one "discussion" with the hackneyed phrase:  "Whatever."  A different subject merits "yada, yada, yada" as her conclusion.  Writing like this insults not only her readers; it diminishes her believability.  Sure, it's fun to learn that the great Honus Wagner once starred in a baseball movie with a little kid named Moses Horowitz  --  who would grow up to become Moe Howard of the Three Stooges.  Of course, it's nice to know that Fred Merkle managed to overcome the stigma of an innocent baserunning mistake.  Yet, for every fact that strengthens "Crazy '08," Murphy invariably shows contempt for the game, undermining all that she has set out to do.  In the heat of the pennant race, the fans of Cleveland purchase and present umpire Tommy Connolly with a loving cup.  To Murphy, "that is taking niceness too far....For heaven's sake, he is still an ump, and therefore to be despised."  Despised, Ms. Murphy?  This cavalier attitude towards real sportsmanship, toward character, permeates this terribly flawed book.  Both scholars and fans who want to read real baseball writing would be better served by picking up David Halberstam, Jonathan Eig or Jules Tygiel.  Those guys are major leaguers.  Cait Murphy is not.  
 If I could give it a zero or negative rating I would.  When VIBE was introduced, it was a relevant, interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative, r&b and hip hop artists.  The mag featured all kinds of artists not just who's hot right now, it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world.  Lately I've noticed that it's nothing more than a fluffy version of The Source.  I hate a lot of new rap music that's out and didn't appreciate mags with rappers I dislike on the cover. And is it me or does it seem like since Mimi took over, all of the female r&b singers' covers and stories are HORRIBLE (we won't even discuss that disgusting Brandy cover)!  This magazine SUCKS now and the only time I check it out is while I'm in line at the grocery store.  Yes, the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking.  I'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription 
 The first cut, Long-legged Guitar Pickin' Man is a fine start, but it's downhill from there, especially with such ill-advised covers as It Ain't Me Babe and What'd I Say 
 This movie was so dumb and slow.  Very bad picture quality and it is also fullscreen.  It also has a storyline that we all have seen like a hundred times. I only gave it 1 star because I am a fan of Bradley Stryker.  He should really consider some real movies instead of the B- movies for DeCoteau. You should see this movie just for the scenes with him.  P.S. he is also in the first Brotherhood movie too, in case you didn't know 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 Charlotte.... oh God! what a change!!! that's pretty sad. I didn't liked this album, just one tune... the one of Even God.... but i hope youll gï¿½t back to sing like an angel 
 I got this book hoping it would be helpful. It was very heavy on the side of psychology, which is of very little help in parenting or life. If a reader feels the field of psychology is worth while, they will probably find this book to be of use. While there were some good points they were few and far between. While readers of books can eat the meat and spit out the bones, this was something like trying to eat tilapia 
 Amartya Sen is a serious economist, who has some serious ideas, but they are not in this book.  The book purports to be an philosophical/economic argument for "freedom now" as both the means and the goal of economic and social policy, and an argument against the postponement of "freedom" until after "purely" economic development has occurred.    Freedom, Sen claims -and not merely wealth or the rule of law- is the best vehicle to promote...well...freedom itself.  If this reasoning sounds circular to you, you are not alone.  On one interpretation, this strikes me as trivially true.  Sure: promote freedom and you will indeed get freedom.  If, on the other hand, Sen is stating that freedom is "the solution" to global poverty, his thesis is dubious at best.  And this is especially so because Sen's book is NOT really a polemic against Confucian statism (i.e. the "Lee thesis"), it is a polemic against economic liberalism.  Lee is just a straw man used to advance Sen's more fundamental claim: that freedom -properly understood- is actually what he refers to as "capability."  In other words: freedom is not merely the absence of external constraints, but the capability to accomplish things in the world.  This is NOT "Development as Freedom" but rather "Freedom as Capability."  And this is where Sen really loses me.  Even IF "capability" is a quantifiable, measureable, controllable, predictable variable that can be maximized (extremely dubious, since the list of possible verbs of which one can be capable is practically infinite), this argument is nothing even remotely new.  Sen's allegedly groundbreaking discovery is simply the modern incarnation of Isaiah Berlin's "positive freedom," FDR's "freedom from want," and the other muddled reinventions of the concept of "freedom" which together date back to the early Counter-Enlightenment.    These ideas sound like doublethink because they are doublethink.  Public health care and make-work jobs simply do not leap to mind when one thinks of "freedom" - if they did, there would be no need for this book.  The conceptual epitome of "freedom" is one's release from prison.  That's not the necessarily the "capability" to do anything.  If we want to discuss welfare economics, on the other hand, that's fine -- but let's not confuse our students by misappropriating the language of liberty.  But I am not deterred from this work merely by the fact that I disagree with Sen's thesis.  In the end, I am turned off by the massive acclaim this book has recieved, despite its glaring intellectual mushiness.  Sen has supplanted Marx as the English professor's favorite economist, distracting attention from those thinkers whose ideas might actually make a modest difference in combating global poverty 
 Lang Lang's powerful and fast fingers just do not work for Chopin.  Chopin's music is as dedicated as "dancing with soul" for every note.  Lang Lang's fingers are just too rude to interpret these subtle notes.  For Mazart Concerto, if you have listened to Horowitz, you will be disappointed with Lang Lang's recording too.  I don't even want to mention the rest recordings.  As I know Lang Lang performs over 120 shows a year.  He is talented and successful at his age. Yet he should spend more time on music itself and understand the virtue of difference. Beyond technical fast fingers, expression is all counts at last 
 This was the cheapest phrase book that I saw offered on Amazon.com and, as trite as it is, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for the most basic of interactions with Italian speakers and are only planning on staying in tourist hotels and shopping in tourist markets, then this might suffice.  However, if you are planning to interact with native Italian speakers in a less superficial way, or if you want to be able to express yourself with somewhat more sophistication, I would recommend another phrase book.  
 Readers who are interested in finding out why the West has been targeted by some extremist Muslims as well as why so much anti-western sentiment exists in not only the Islamic world but the developing world at large (and more recently almost the entire world) would be better off reading the works of Edward Said - an Arab Christian who was a true scholar of Middle Eastern and European/American history and documented in several of his works many of the reasons the West is not held in high esteem - and with good reason as anyone would understand if they were on the receiving end (if you are not on the receiving end thank God or your lucky stars whatever works for you).   Mark Gabriel's book is a sad story about a man who experienced persecution that should never have happened, however, it does nothing to help the reader understand the true roots of anti-western sentiment, or the violence perpetrated by a small number of Muslim extremists. I can understand his bitterness given his experiences. However, given his negative experiences and his rejection of Islam personally it is reasonable to infer (as the book demonstrates) that his views of Islam and its history are quite tainted. This book provides the reader with nothing but a very biased and stereotypical account of Islam and its history - IT WILL NOT HELP ANY WESTERNER UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES THAT EXIST IN THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY.  By the way I believe you if you read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" you will see that there is no civiliation, Islamic, American, or otherwise that does not have violent blemishes in its past and present. However, these violent blemishes should not be used to characterize entire civiliations in their entirety which Gabriel's book unfortunately does.    If you want to truly understand the roots of violence perpetrated by a very small group of Muslims (remember there are 1 billion Muslims in the world and those committing acts of violence are drop in the bucket compared to the immense size of the total population - also let's not forget that plenty of violence has been perpetrated by some groups of Christians and Jews both in contemporary times and in the past) than read books by scholars who understand the pain and suffering of the Palestinians, the Iraqis, the Afghanis, and the ongoing humiliation, torture, and death, these people have suffered at the hands of the West, not to mention the humiliating history of European colonization and imperialism that has left its mark on the region. Also be reminded that the U.S.'s support of oppressive dictators in the region is not lost on the people who live and suffer under those oppressive regimes such as Bush's good friends the Saudi royal family. And of course Sadam Hussain, a current villian in the U.S., was once highly favored by the U.S. government who supplied him with arms and other types of aid during the eight year Iran-Iraq war. He lost his popularity with the U.S. government after he decided he no longer liked being a puppet.   For a more accurate in-depth view of the history of the influence of the West on the East read Edward Said's foundational book "Orientalism," "the Question of Palestine," or Arhandati Roy's "An Ordinary Persons Guide to Empire."  Here you will read words and truths from scholars who come from colonized peoples, scholars who are/were not only great writers and scholars but who also write/wrote from a non-western perspective. If you want to understand the perspectives of Arabs and Muslims than reading books written by biased Westerners such as Gabriel is not the way to go. On the other hand if your true motive in reading about Islam is to reinforce your existing hatreds, biases, and stereotypes, by all means read his book with relish - it will serve your intended purpose well.  
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 Given the current woes of the American auto industry, I find it surprising that people take this book seriously. It is merely a puff piece for the "We're number one" Americans who prefer self-satisfaction to facing reality 
 I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame up the hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to make  their form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's a  tragic time we live in when all that matters is using religion for power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakes the United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess we in now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it's  people like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islam  hating war mongers 
 Stupid story line, silly characters and so predictable...what did I miss that all of the other reviewers found so earth-shattering????  It was slightly entertaining but basically a waste of time.  When it finally came to an end I had no emotional response except that I was glad I was finished.  I don't know what else to say except don't bother with it.  There are LOTS of great books out there and this isn't one of them.  I kept reading it because of all the wonderful reviews, and thought it MUST get better once I got into it...NOT!!!  I guess I really missed something here, but for the life of me I can't imagine what it was!!??  I am a fanatic reader of ALL types of writing styles but this one just soared right past me.  Don't bother with it 
 My wife and I purchased the VIDEONOW XP Interactive Video System for my son this Christmas however when we did Walmart was out of the headphones.  Well I was on Amazon one day and decided to look here.  I ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived.  My 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders.  No matter how we tried that is all they would do.  My 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result!  I am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose.  These are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse.  I would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child.  If Tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device 
 This is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons. First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events. I understand if you can't cover everyone, of course you can't, but they left out more than they included. Really disappointing...I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again 
 Blum's style is horrendous.  She traipses from one anecdote about her son to the findings of scientists she has interviewed without the blink of an eye.  She does not so much advance arguments or conclusions as much as merely advance dumbed-down versions of scientific studies.  Matters such as which questions underlie the research and what the research reveals are interspersed with bad puns and Blum's own opinion as to whether something is insulting or disgusting.  Her attempts to lighten the fare are patronizing and distracting.  She wrote way too much about non-humans.  This or that primate species is simply not the human species.  The differences between them are so great that their relevance for the human species does not seem to be established.    Most of the research she chose was physiological, behavioral, and anthropological.  Evolutionary biology (a.k.a. sociobiology) gets only occasional treatment, despite its recent progress in explaining male and female differences.    Note also that the book was published in 1997.  I write in 2005, so the book is eight years old.  Try to find something more up to date on the subject.  Overall, the book's faults can most easily be attributed to the fact that the author is a journalist and not a scientist.  She sarificed too much to appealing to the general readership and is not well-schooled in the science of human sex differences herself 
 I've been watching this item for a while to buy for my wife.  I saw the reviews about it stopping and basically not working correctly and figured that this was a pretty serious fault and someone in a factory somewhere would be working on a solution to this.  So it's been many months since the last review and I decided what the heck, I'll take the plunge and buy it and we'll see if they fixed it.  Nope.  It's still broken as detailed in the other reviews.  At times, it simply will not go off.  Your best warning is when you stop hearing the ticking.  I still give it 2 stars though because the wife loves how cute it is.  She doesn't even care that the thing fails to serve it's primary function.  I guess if you are looking for a figurine rather than a timer, this could be a winner 
 The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an "f".  Instead of "Another Life", it should more appropriately be titled "Another Lie."  Although it is a  well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions  of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any  non-fiction library.  Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always  in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book  must be viewed very skeptically.  Korda not only takes credit for himself  but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and  the mastermind.  After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of  Korda's "memory" when he always appeared as the brilliant,  all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in.  When I came  to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he  was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just  wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the  principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of  Korda's stories.  But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and  check what Korda was relating about his publshing career.  Alas, he has  created more fiction than fact in relating these tales.  I could write half  a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in  point.  His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch.  On  pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as "some unknown woman in New  Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote"  the book which HE discovered and became the best seller  "Penmarric".  This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he  is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to  determine that she, indeed, has written a great book.  ACTUALLY, Susan  Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected  author of three novels published by Stein & Day by the time Korda  caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his  discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the  subtle parallel between "Penmarric"'s plot and the lives of Henry  II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed  to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else  might also notice.  Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance,  assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and  published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor  similarities.  HOW CURIOUS.  Especially since Howatch's book states in  passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and  how it applies to the following chapter.  She plainly wrote the parallel  right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel.  And  every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times,  who thought it added greatly to the book's success.  What is Korda talking  about!  I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and  erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's  sense of self-importance.  The real crime here is how Korda gets away with  these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert  Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get  publish.  It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging  Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own  industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and  Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world  is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes,  book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken  it another giant leap 
 First let's talk about the positives: It talks about male-bashing, which I don't agree with either she encourages mmore affection on the woman's part....those who are inconsiderate of their husband's feelings It has some "romantic" (on first glance) views of husbands...how sweet  Now let's get down to why you should buy this book:  Buy this book if you don't mind having sex with your husband even though you're "not in the mood" Look, maybe there are times when BOTH of you guys can work stuff out and make things more enticing for both of you when one is not "in the mood"...but HELLO....she's encouraging all WOMEN to deny their feelings no matter what to please 'her man'  buy this book if you think most men are heros, willing to do anything for their wives, and wives should understand this...and cater to their men because it's their "duty"  Buy this book if you think the feminist movement screwed women over...why? Because it encouraged them to be more independent, free to do whatever the you-know-what they really want to do (i.e. careers, etc.), make money, and to not give in to all gender stereotypes imposed on females by society.   Buy this book if you think woman have a certain "status" to be lady-like: while it's acceptable for men, Dr. Laura thinks woman should not display rudeness (hmm, I suppose it's never ok for a female to be "rude"? I can think of a few situations where speaking up for something can be construed as "being rude"), smoke, act vulgar, or be promiscuous. Of course, it's the women that will encourage their men to be the same way.   Buy this book if you agree that you can either have a family and be a "homemaker" or have a career...not both, no compromise.  Buy this book if you're gay and have decided to become straight and live a good, wholesome married life   
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 After the wonderful Storming Heaven I was so excited to read this book, and then so disappointed.  The plot is melodramatic, the characterizations cardboard 
 A rambling, self-obsessed, horrendously written bore. If you don't know any obnoxious NY princesses, and you are simply desperate to feel like you're at a really bad party, monopolized by a self-absorbed narcissist, you will find your own personal ring of hell with this book!! Otherwise, steer clear! 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 The Zone is a great diet if you have good recipes (not many in here) and if it has the proportions that you need for your personal meal. I've gotten a few good ones out of "What to Eat in the Zone". There are two different weekly menus - for women and for men. Not so in this book. It is based entirely on men. If you are a woman, you have to figure it out for yourself how much to cut down on the ingredients. Some things are obvious - if it calls for 4 oz of meat, you go to 3 oz. But the rest of the recipe is too difficult to figure out. Some people say the Zone is complicated enough as it is, and this book doesn't make a case against that, unless, of course, you are a man.  Also, the desserts are usually figured for 4 to 8 servings. If you're the only one in the house on the diet, too bad. These aren't things that freeze or store well either. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book, as I'd be disappointed 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!! 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 Albeit I'm not much of a TV viewer I rather see this TV series than read another book like this. When you read a book and since the beginning you know who's the bad guy half plot goes down. If you read technicalities that you don't understand just to show that the writer knows too many things that you really don't care, there goes down the other half. When you finish this book you'll know how to build a rocket. How to make more powerful fuel for it. How to make drugs heavier, and many other things. Of course to do all that you'll need a very special paraphernalia. So I rather start watching TV than read another like this.   If you like to read about TV series read "24 Declassified: Veto Power" by John Whitman. This book'll thrill you all the way. 
 My recommendation would be to read the Bible and leave Tim Lahaye alone. If you like, put a picture of Jesus, color and ethnicity your choice, on the wall. Feel good. Get Tim Lahaye's diabolical nonsense out of your life. Think about the friends you have, not the enemies. This man specializes in pointing fingers at people, known to God, but poorly understood by Tim Lahaye 
 The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful.  It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism.  The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it.  The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos.  Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'.  It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers.  Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.  This movie could have been a classic 
 Young Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is an up and coming rodeo bull rider who suffers a movie opening Serious Injury.  Brother Hank (Kiefer Sutherland) is the responsible older brother who raises bulls, teaches a zen-ish style of bull riding (`Empty your heart of hate before you ride,' that kind of thing) and is a rodeo clown - the fellow who distracts the bull after its thrown his rider and, reasonably enough from the bull's point of view, wants to crush into pulp the prone body of the thrown rider.   I've kind of made a point of searching out and watching rodeo movies.  There aren't a lot of them, and most concentrate on the maverick qualities of the rodeo rider.  Always a bull rider, by the way.  Most, too, feature some heavy hitters - guys like Steve McQueen and Cliff Robertson - in the lead roles.  COWBOY UP is a little different.  Bull riding is more of a backdrop here, a setting against which sibling rivalry, a search for a lost father, and some sticky romantic entanglements can be played out.  Not that we don't get a LOT of slow-motion shots of mucus draining bulls bucking and snorting and doing their best to toss and trample their tormenters (again, `tormenters' from the bull's point of view.)  It's just there's a whole lot more soap than horse in this opera.   Which wouldn't be so bad if the second lead, Marcus Thomas, was a polished actor.  Unfortunately his one expression seems to be that of stunned introspection, as thought on the first day of the shoot a crew member had asked him a preposterous question that he couldn't get out of his head.  Thomas is talking to a grip, say, on that first day, and the grip wonders out loud whether birds would have to fly if they had opposable thumbs. Thomas guffaws, of course, but every time the studio lights fire up the question returns to gnaw at him, and when he should be `in the moment,' or whatever it is actors say, with movie girlfriend Connie (Molly Ringwald,) instead he's picturing a southbound autumn highway with clusters of hitchhiking ducks.     I'm not sure it matters, anyway.  The story's kind of an ill-fitting hybrid to begin with.  Things become more complicated later when young Ely hooks up with pretty rodeo horse rider Celia Jones (Daryl Hannah,) brother Hank's old flame, which supplies just enough plot to propel the film to the grand finale.  Ely's search for his missing father is resolved, although that search was so unstressed in the movie I didn't even realize it was a Big Issue until it was on me.  And, of course, as in almost all rodeo movies, Ely gets to ride the big bull, preferably the one who threw him earlier.  In this case the big bull is Zapata, one of brother Hank's bulls, in fact.   I've never been a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but he's great in this one.  Ringwald, Hannah, and Melinda Dillon - the mother in both `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and `The Christmas Story' - are wasted as sideline fodder who have little more to do than seduce or wring their hands and hope Ely gets some sense and give up the bull riding.  The highlight of the movie for me came when, while Hannah and Thomas were deep in their fling, Ringwald and Sutherland shared a piece of consolation pie at the local diner.  Ringwald, inevitably I guess, says to Sutherland, `In a different world you and I would have made a lot more sense.'  Hey, Molly - in a different and better movie you and Sutherland would have made a lot more sense, too.  	COWBOY UP might appeal to hard-core rodeo fans, but the rest of us would be better advised to steer clear of this one. 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong.  For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off.  Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).   The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband 
 This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.   However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts. 
 I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 I really don't understand why there are so many positive ratings on this book.  It is useless to me.  Full of high level superficial suggestions, lack of knowledgeable insights.  I don't think I need someone to tell me that it is important to research the market, and to know your competitors.  A lot of places in the book says "talk to your account for this and that...", or "go to www.somewebsite.com...".  If I have to refer to somebody else or go somewhere else for any in-depth topic, what do I buy this book for?? 
 This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen! I can't  believe how stupid it was! How some people think this is great film is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond me! It's a total snore-fest!  Plus it had way too much sexual humor!  Don't waste your time on this awful movie! 
 The fact that Euge wanted to use equipment no later than 1976 did facinate me. However, even with the great collaborators he worked with, this was not Euge's best work,  I'd expected way more effort than his previous albums. The only song I liked in the album was "Chillaxin." Other than that nothing else caught my attention.  My biggest problem are the interludes in the CD's. While some CD's include just one interlude, there is no reason valuable space on a CD shouldn't be wasted on 3 INTERLUDES!!! To me, that's laziness not creativity. Because of these interludes, this CD is one of the shortest playing CD's I have.  Other than that, this CD is good on a slow relaxing day if you don't mind changing CDs in a short time. I'd rather keep listening to his Livin Large CD 
 I listened to the audio copy of this book and it is too raunchy for my taste. Christine Baranski, who reads the book makes most of the characters sound like stuck up snobs, unlike what Bette, Goldie or Diane do in the movie. The movie, at least, gives the story humor and keeps the sex at a minimum.  
 I grew up in one of the neighborhoods portrayed in this book, and while I believe the author has accurately described Jessica, Coco and their friends and relatives, these people are not representative of everyone who lives in the South Bronx. There are many, many people in these neighborhoods who shun the drug-dealing and thug lifestyle. These people work hard at low paying jobs (think doormen, porters, mailroom clerks, cashiers) and scrimp and save to send their children to Catholic school. They don't hang out on street corners and they don't allow their children to do so either. And they are the victims of people like Boy George and Cesar, they are the ones whose apartments are robbed, whose children are beaten on the way home from school, whose daughters are harassed.   I hate the idea that middle-class white liberals are reading this book and getting some kind of voyeuristic thrill. I suspect they wouldn't be nearly as enthralled by a book that chronicled the lives of the people I've described above, the ones who try to live upstanding lives despite overwhelming poverty and the threats of the street. 
 Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.  
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 I was very disappointed with this book given the high standard of F.Paul Wilson's other works.  I read the book after reading the online reviews which said it was 'Excellent" and a 'Must Buy", but it seemed to me this novel was something Mr Wilson put together on a wet Wednesday afternoon.  In my opinion you'd be better off to save your money and wait for the next Repairman Jack novel 
 This coffeemaker makes the WORST coffee of any I have owned in 26 years.  It "brews" very quickly, losing a "cup" or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top.  The coffee is weak and bitter (no matter what brand we have tried).  About the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed, creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop.  We thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly, and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on. The same thing has happened twice more. This coffeemaker is a piece of junk 
 This book sux, i'm not even joking, its crap. All the info is bs, and you can find more out about everything on the internet, with (gasp) Color pictures!?! This book has black and white pics...and not very many of them, if i could give this book absolutely no stars at all i would. ITS CRAP!! DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY! 
 Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn't that famous is because it pretty much sucks. It's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie. No realy kung fu here 
 Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge 
 The only good thing are the actors..not for good acting but for hot!! Really handsome guys 
 I didn't think this was that great.  I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all 
 This video is all hype and delivers nothing.  I love dancing.  Dancing in this video is horrible.  For the latin section, there was hardly anything LATIN about it!  It was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them.  Ick!  Not too mention it's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added.  I love Latin dancing and didn't enjoy this at all.  The other dancing sections were equally cheesy.  They were soo cheesy I just felt like an idiot doing them.  If you are not at a stage in life where you still go to clubs/go out, i.e. 40+) then you MIGHT enjoy this.  If you do currently go out dancing it's just going to be torture.   As for the workout, very low-intensity and lots of lulls as another reviewer said.  Definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing (because this is horrible) or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up.  I wouldn't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy.  I think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem!  Don't waste your money....  there are lots of better vids out there.  This is awful 
 I bought this book to prepare for my relocation to Qatar (from Australia).  The book is so out of date it is downright useless. For example, even basic information such as visa requirements is wrong (you *can* get a tourist visa when you turn up at Doha airport). And recommendations about what's on, what's good, what's bad are meaningless - many of the things described don't exist any more or have been superceded.  I was seriously considering sending my book to Lonely Planet and asking for my money back, but it's easier to hop onto the web and complain instead. More useful too!  Having said that, I don't know of any other guides to buy instead. My suggestions are:  If you're planning on moving to Qatar, do. Quality of life here is fantastic, except that outdoor activites are curtailed by the heat most of the year. Recommend you get in contact with someone who lives here for tips.  If you're planning on a holiday to Qatar, don't. There is almost nothing here for tourists, except for 4WD'ing on the dunes which is unique and fun (go for Arabian Adventures, they're the best operator). I would recommend instead Oman (for the scenery and Arabic culture) and Dubai (shopping, astonishing real estate developments)  Back to the book: Completely out of date, and you can pick up the history bits off the net. And I'm just talking about the Qatar section here, no comment on the other two countries (but I would *really* question why you would want to go to them 
 Disc Picture: The stylized VC-1-encoded 1.85:1 HD DVD picture features differing color schemes depending on the location. The entire presentation is void of highly resolved fine details.   Soundtrack: The Dolby® Digital Plus 5.1-channel soundtrack is not overly exciting, although bass is delivered well through each of the channels, although the noise floor is low, dialogue and effects are generally well recorded, and the sound matches the storytelling nicely.  
 For many years, Middle East departments of American universities including Columbia have provided intentionally fake and fraudulent education on Middle East problem and history to American students.  The Table below lists major milestones of the Middle East history and demonstrates that long before Arabs came in Palestine, there were Jewish states and Jerusalem was a capital of one of them.  In 1917-18, British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land (Palestine) from the Turks. During the WWII, Palestinian Arab clerics contacted Hitler and asked him to exterminate Palestinian Jews. There prove, that Jews lived there before creation of the state of Israel in 1948.   The 1964 PLO Charter addressed to UN used term "Palestinian Arabs" and PLO did not claim Judea, Samarea (so called West Bank), and Gaza their territories.  The term and national group "Palestinians" have been invented some time after 1967 by Arabs who fooled the entire world because the world would like to be fooled.  They also invented a fable that Jews never lived in Palestine. In 2003, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq, together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland were preparing an enormous lawsuit against all the Jews of the world.  They blamed Israelites, who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC, of stealing gold from Egypt.  In other word, Dr. Nabil Hilmi and his colleague acknowledged that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land. Major Milestones of Israel History  13th century BC	Exodus from Egypt 12th to 11th centuries BC	Israelites returned to the Promised Land 1000 BC	David makes Jerusalem the capital 930 BC	Kingdom divided into Judah and Israel 721 BC	Conquest Israel by Assyrians 586 BC	Conquest Judah by Babylonians; sacking of Jerusalem 333 BC	Conquest by Alexander the Great 395-636 AC	Byzantine rule 614 AC	Persian invasion 636 AC	Beginning of Arab rules 1517 	Ottoman conquest 1917-18 	British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land from the Turks 1942-1944	Palestinian Arabs ask Hitler for exterminating Palestinian Jews  1948	Proclamation of Jewish state 1964	According to Article 24 of the PLO charter Palestinian Arabs do not claim West Bank and Gaza their territories 2003	Dr. Nabil Hilmi together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland acknowledge that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land  
 This is one more example of a book by a journalist posing as a sex expert. The media create so-called "experts," and Sabrina Weill is one of them. All the tired cliches and ideas can be found: losing virginity (when it is really a gain in freedom) and the fuzzy place of not recommending comprehensive sex education while walking the line with abstinence "education." Weill simply speaks the fuzzy line of the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy, which has failed to come down clearly in favor of comprehensive sex education. We don't need a thousand more studies to indicate that telling the truth is better than preaching.   Unfortunately, the truth is not always obvious in this book. The study carried out by the author is not particularly well designed and the sample is not much. Weill has some helpful observations about discussions with parents, but most of her book is not relevant to today's teenagers, who are active sexually. She is biased against friends-with-benefits, but this is actually a more balanced choice than possessive dating or hooking up for many.     
 I think this book was the boringest, and dumbest book ever!   But I have to say that the movie was pretty good and funny so you have to give that credit 
 The entire premise of this book is "If you hold the bible up to the light of the full-moon while standing on one leg, one can plainly see how scriptures and science are in harmony" While I can think of many colorful short phrases to describe this book while it ricochets of the wall into the trash can, the initials "B,S" comes to mind.   Schroeder wants the reader to believe that the book of Genesis makes reference to Einstein's theory of relativity! Supposedly, Einstein's time-dilation explains why the Creation "days" are actually long eons of time and that quantum mechanics can be used to explain other apparent contradictions between Genesis and the findings of modern science.  Never, I say again never have mankind witnessed the establishment of a scientific fact that came about as a result of biblical investigation.  These pseudo scientists lurks in the murky shadows of biblical nonsense until real science reviles some wonderful and enlighten truth about our world.  Then they pounce and yell "Eureka!!!", bible in hand, ready to defile and hijack true scientific findings.   By reinterpreting the bible to conform to reality is nothing short of intellectual dishonesty.  For it is written starting from Genesis that "The evening and the morning was the first DAY!!!"  The evening and the morning was the second DAY!!".... so on and so on" "Six DAYS you shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh DAY is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.  For in six DAYS the Lord made the heavens and the Earth and rested on the seventh DAY"......Exodus 20: 9, 11.  Hence 1 day = 24hrs    Wouldn't it be fun to see how "science in the bible" explains how dead people rise from the tome and rejoin the living, how blindness, leprosy, paralysis are healed just by a mere touch????????            This book makes a mockery out of science and a travesty to critical thinking.  Click your heels together three times Mr. Schroeder then return to reality. The rest of us are waiting for you.    In Reason.  
 I was disappointed with the album as a whole.  When I heard the song "Drink to Me Babe, Then", I thought it was great and sounded like The Shins.  The rest of the album was boring lyrically 
 THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HISTORY ABOUT THE HERBS AND MIKE CASTLEMAN STUDY'S ON HOW OLD THE VEDAS IS, IS INCORRECT. IT SEEMS THAT HE HAS TO STUDY MORE. HOW IA A PERSON GOING TO WRITE A BOOK WHEN HE GIVES YOU THE WRONG INFORMATION ON HOW OLD THE VEDAS IS COMMON 4500 YEARS OLD? IT'S MUCH OLDER THEN THAT. HE NEEDS TO STICK TO WHAT HE KNOWS, WHICH IS THE BIBLE 
 After reading all of the reviews, I was so excited to view a great film.  However, after about an hour of waiting for something plausible to happen, it just drifted . . . and drifted . . . and meandered . . . and, oh here's a scene:  she says "No" to the main character advances, and he ignores her initial rejection . . . and then it meanders more into something so absurd that I started to laugh.    C'mon, people!  To all of you 4- and 5-star people, just because a film involves beautiful settings and artsy characters, that does NOT constitute a story!!  I'm sorry, maybe it's me, but message to the character Claudia in the movie:  If some cad starts coming onto you while he's simultaneously searching for his fiancee (and your friend) who may very well have drowned, then get a 1000 miles away from this scum . . . and to all viewers watching this exercise in self-indulgence and boredom, get a 1000 miles away from this farce of a film.  I am an enormous fan of stylish, artistic films, but just like those paintings at fancy museums that are being portrayed as elite art but instead are just simple circles and triangles on a blank canvas, this film is NOT art.  It's just boring, boring, boring, uninteresting.  I could not care about these characters any less, other than poor Anna who disappeared from that island . . . . actually, now that I think about it, Anna was the only smart one there!  She jumped off that island as quickly as she could so as get out of this ostentatious, boring, pompous, self-indulgent, uneventful, dreadful, meandering, dumb film!  Way to go, Anna!  You're the only one with any sense.  Even if you did drown, trust me, that is a better fate than having to survive this DULL film.  So, in case you didn't get my point, let me spell it out once again:  I HATED this film so completely!  I would rather watch water trickling from my sink.  At least that has a story!!  Aaaargh -- I want my 2 hours back!  I gave up 2 precious hours of my life to watch this pathetic film 
 I find that it wil not only be a big hassle, which is to be expected, but also expensive and too difficult to find these superfood 
 This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars 
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 I loved every DMB album up until this one. After 10 years of making the most profoundly wonderful music, the law of averages has finally kicked in for Dave and crew. I have been a fan since 1997 and loved everything about this band. Every album and every song was superb!   This album is a HUGH departure from the tradition Dave Matthews Band that all true DMB fans know and love. This album has also made a division between old hardcore DMB fans (fans of the REAL band that includes all 5 members) and new DMB fans (the "I heard it on the radio and liked it" fans)  This album does not include all 5 members as Leroi and Boyd are almost non-existent leaving just the guitar, bass, and drums ie. the meat and potatoes of a band. Every band has a guitar, bass and drums making them sound just about like every other band out there. Now how many bands do you know that have a fiddle and a sax/wind instruments in them? DMB used to be one of them. You won't find the adrenaline pumping fiddle solos or the heartfelt wind work on this album.  Next we have Dave playing electric guitar and co-writing the majority of the songs over a weekend and boy does it show. He co-wrote these songs with the new producer Glenn Ballard who plays piano on this one as well. The only song that is a work of art lyrically is The Space Between. I also like Everyday as well only because its an evolved form of a true DMB song, #36 (Hani Hani). This one is a real treat to see live as the band will sometime play both #36 and Everyday together.  Yes I will say again...Dave plays an electric on this one. Big mistake going from what your traditionally known as being acoustic then going directly to electric...just ask Dylan about this one. I felt like I Did It was an assault on my ears and took my breath away and not in a good way. My jaw dropped to the floor in disbelief and I just could not believe what I was hearing. This was not Dave Matthews Band! The only song that the electric worked with was The Space Between due to it being a dark and sad ending to a relationship. GREAT poetry and lyrics to that one and that song saves the a star from being a 1/5.  There are a lot of reviews on here that are saying that it took a few listens before they really liked it. I believe that these are fans that are just in denial and I can't blame them. Did it take a few listens before you fell in love with this band? When I first heard Crash Into Me and Too Much I was just floored and could not believe the sounds I was hearing. Not with this so called DMB. A band with a sax and a fiddle that makes it work!!?? WOW!   Take the 4 things out that make DMB, DMB and you get a mediocre any band. The 4 things that make the formula of Dave Matthews Band work are the uplifting and awe inspiring explosive fiddle solos from Boyd (Ants Marching), the emotional wind works of Leroi (Say Goodbye), Dave's lyrics (#41 and I'm not a big fan of Dave's vocals but thats on every album...I wish they would put out an all instrumental album), and the tricky timings, rhythms, and beats of Carter (#36 Live at Red Rocks), all of which pretty much do not exist on this album.  This is not DMB and if you do buy it at least you won't buy it under the false pretense that your buying a DMB album. Go get any other album besides this and Stand Up (which is even more disappointing then Everyday)  Hardcore DMB fans...you have been warned 
 I've read (and enjoyed) all of Shermans previous books. This one plain stank. Horribly. Painfully.   Bought as light reading while sitting in my hotel room, it went into the garbage can very quickly, pretty much unread.  Summation: Not worth reading even when suffering from terminal boredom. Even watching "Jerry Springer" on the TV isn't as painful or nauseating as this book 
 Some great B grade to Z grade movies that are often hard to find, so if the movie you're looking for is in this collection then be warned that the quality of the source (old video)is no match for any reasonable expectations. Example: The Invasion of the Bee Girls is still much clearer on my 30 year old video copy than it is on the DVD version.  The B/W ones are reasonably clear and I prefer to watch these than the washed out -no contrast - over saturated colour versions.  Millcreek (the production company) seem to have done little to fix up the source stock, or maybe the source stock was incapable of being fixed. Too bad! If you are desperate for the titles then I recommend that you buy this collection, otherwise try and find it yourself as an original 
 This book reads like it was written by a first grader.  I know it's a children's book, but the text lacks any sort of originality or imagination.  The first two paragraphs are repeated throughout the entire book, with only a couple words changed.  It seems like these days, you don't have to be a good writer to write a children's book, you just need a cute gimmick 
    The seller stated book was new.  It had wear on it and the front page was cut out where the CD should have been.  I was very dissappointed in the condition.  It was too late to return it as class was starting.    This is the only time I was ever disappointed.  Usually extremely satisfied 
 Save your money and purchase the REAL stories 'outlined' in this cheap book put together to ride the wave of The Perfect Storm.  The collection of stories is nothing more than a collection of extended abstracts of the real stories.  Many of the 'abstracts' are taken out of context and the reader does not get an accurate picture of what and why the nautical situation developed or how it concluded.  Pass on this one 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 The software that comes with this is not the right software for the VX8500 
 For an "encyclopedia" this book is severly lacking in detail and coverage on the subject. This is a thin book that gives very short descriptions of a limited number of treatments. Many very common and popular spa treatments are not even included, while other obscure and non-existent in most spas found their way into the book. If you're looking for information on what is done during many of the common spa treatments used today and what their benefits are I do not suggest this book. I was very disappointed 
 Mmmmm...I really don't know how I feel about this particular version of the Bible...it is actually kind of weird...it really is...I know that it's trying to get more and more people to read it and understand it, but I really don't think this book does it...at least, not for me it didn't.  The only translation that really does it for me, is the Lamsa Bible. It is translated from the original Aramaic...which, by the way, is the language that Jesus actually spoke. Did you know that "Abba" actually means, "Good Daddy"...it also means "Bad 70s music..." just kidding...but yeah, when Jesus called God, Abba, he was basically saying, My Good Daddy provides me with everything I could want and need, which, of course, drove the scribes crazy and which would probably drive some "Christians" crazy if they really understood the Aramaic language.  Not that I do, mind you...I'm not an Aramaic Scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but I have studied books by Rocco Errico and his mentor, George Lamsa.   So, no, I can't say that I really recommend this particular version of the Bible. It doesn't jive well wit da soul and all dat...y'know, what I'm sayin'...  Me neither.. 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 ...there is no denying there are errors in this book. My friend's daughter is searching for a college, and after reading my alma mater's entry - I told her to look elsewhere for her information. Signed - a "Mawrtyr" - class of '90 
 It's a narrative. I thought it would be the life of Buddha as portrayed by actors. Kinda dry. The cover art is beautiful tho 
 This book is pretty much everything your friends and family suggested to you when you spoke of having a small budget for your wedding.  The author herself seems a lovely person,  but frankly, some of the advice is insultingly simple minded.  The best book to buy is "Bridal Bargains" 
 The story is set in late 1943 but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting. A decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake, but maybe not. 
 This music is so pathetic and disgusting it makes me want to swallow dog vomit.  Why listen to these miserable imitations when I can go and buy the ORIGINAL renditions?  It is like wanting to go watch your high school band play instead of the London Symphony.  Perfect for 10-14 year old girls.  Anyone outside of that age range that listens to this should be run over by Simon's car.  I bet you listen to Blink-182 and R. Kelly the child-molester as well 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 I can't know why this band is so popular as they are so BORING!!!!!! They've only made a single listenable song in "Highway to Hell". Rest of that, they suck!!!! For Those About to Rock is really awful, don't purchase this junk...get Brothers In Arms from Dire Straits insted. That rocks, not this!!!!!!!! 
 First and foremost, I am huge fan of Elton John.  Unfortunately, the same can not be said for my opinion of most musicals such as this.  That being said, I would only ask that before you disagree with the value of this review, please take that into account.  I've had this CD for quite a while now, periodically going back to give it ONE MORE TRY.  And I just can't get into it.  I find the music here to be so overbearingly scripted and unoriginal, that it immediately leaves my player for weeks before I try it again.  And again....  The bottom line is that I've heard these songs before....  Many, many times....  The point of this review is by no means to knock the art of musicals.  For those of you that are fans of them, I'm sure this soundtrack is a true joy to listen to and I hope you enjoy it.  (I see that many of you do).  This review is for those folks who, like me, were on the fence about buying this CD because they are ardent supporters of EJ's more pop-oriented music.  Trust me on this one, if you have the special edition of Peachtree Road, or have already downloaded Elton's versions of "Electricity" and "The Letter", you have all you need from this release.  As a last note, for those who are still not sure, Elton's version of "Maggie Thatcher" is a good indication of the kind of songs that permeate this soundtrack. If you enjoy his version of that, there is a very good chance you will like this CD more than I do.  Thanks for reading.... 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 Of the dozens of books I have read about the Beatles, both individually and as a group, this is one of the most glaring examples of unreadable drivel I have seen.  Another reviewer lauds this book for not containing any factual errors, when, in fact, it contains many, all easily verifiable through other reliable sources.  Sandford's writing style is obnoxiously self-absorbed and annoying, and his reviews and opinions of the Beatles' music are totally unnecessary and expendable.  There is little here that hasn't been hashed over dozens of times in other, better books.  I opened this book with high hopes, but closed it with a sense of sad disappointment 
 Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 No real practical advise.   It seems to me that boundaries are somewhat personnel. Yet the author treats them as if they are absolutes.  Apparently someone asked her if she every had an abortion. She commented that such a person could never be her friend. Apparently because the person did not recognize the universality of the authors boundaries  She also tends to see men in a negative light; rapist, alcoholics, controlling, domineering. Women are portrayed as victims. 
 Interesting experimental fiction.  In Big Trouble, Barry employs the technique of shifting protagonists so well that in the end the reader isn't sure who the story is about.  Characters are abandoned with abandon and neglected through carelessness, leaving a laser sharp focus on what the novel is really about--which is not the psychodelic frog.  It's something less original.  The genre is also well disguised.  Is it a comedy or a thriller?  If a novel is funny, can we take the thriller part seriously enough?  In some cases, yes.  When, for example, the comedy is built on clever dialogue by characters truly capable of mayhem.  In this case, no.  It's a little jarring when a comic cop is traveling around, chained to an entertainment center, while a teenage girl is in the clutches of a sex-oriented crazy.  In all fairness, the novel does feature a ticking clock, which is handy to have in a thriller.  It's more effective if there is something believable about the story.  I expected a novel with an overdose of silliness, but I was spared that, which was a plus.  No characters with absurdly meaningful names.  The nuts and bolts aspect of writing was competently performed.  While there was little depth to any characters, that's probably less of a requirement for characters  we want to laugh at.  The characters could have used some personality, but that's a common flaw.  The novel should have been funny in places, for a list of situations would show some potential.  But I had no difficulty keeping a straight face throughout.  Others would disagree.  The politically incorrect portrayal of Miami was entertaining, if not actually funny.  The overall effect of reading Big Trouble is to bring about a yearning for the days when an editor would say, "Sir, I know your name is a household word, and I know we could make money on whatever you write, but I have to turn down too many good novels to give a green light to...to something like this."  If there ever were such days.  
 It's a shame, I wonder sometimes how some no talented singers like Rickie Lee Jones managed to even sing somewhere and have a record company sign them. She's awful, no voice at all. I rated 1 star only because 0 star is not available on the scale.    
 Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now.  
 I was not familiar with M. Cho, being an American living overseas for so long. So I thought that I would get acquainted with a different aspect of American culture and bring some laughs to my door-step. Though I found some passages funny and entertaining, her narration comes off as tedious and repetitive, infrequently humorous. Her tragic life seems dramatically sad, and Cho seems to want to bring laughter out of brashness and dismal situations. Congratulations for trying to pull herself out of so many self-defeating habits and for trying to find some humour there. I found her "new-agey" comments too superficial for interest. I good try, but the bleakness of her unhappy life is not salvaged by the humour, that seems too scarce for a notorious comedian. This is a review of her 4 CD audiobook 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 Same cover and look as previous White Trash Cooking books, but not written by Ernest Matthew Mickler.  With Ernest's untimely passing, cousin Trisha attempts to pick up the pen and cookin' legacy of Mr. Mickler.  She,  unfortunately for us, fails.  Filled with short, uninviting recipes, this  cookbook does not have the same zing or endearing writing flair that her  cousin so easily wrought. Skip this one altogether and stick with the  original two by Ernest:  White Trash Cooking and White Trash Cooking II,  Recipes for Gathern's 
 The whole point of buying casebooks like this is to have handy a collection of the most pertinent points of relevant cases presented in an effective manner that makes sense.  That said, Sullivan (who FAILED the CA bar exam) does a horrible job editing, and fails to make a decent casebook.  Many of the cases in this book are either significantly under-edited, leaving you to wallow through the entirety of all or almost all of the opinions, with no focus whatsoever.    The rest are merely noted in brief paragraphs, oversimplified and summarized beyond recognition, glossing over major Constitutional turning points (especially so in the sections on the incorporation doctrine and reproductive rights).  Sullivan especially oversummarizes and oversimplifies Rehnquist and Scalia's opinions in an unhelpful manner (displaying her extreme left-leaning).  The most telling sign of the poor editing is the very size of the text.  It is massive.  It is no surprise that inside Sullivan utterly fails to make her points succinctly or directly.  Chances are, if you are reading this, you HAVE to buy this book for a class.  Woe be to you.  Settle for a cheaper, used, old edition of this texgt, and go buy yourself a decent outline 
 Very interesting stuff but there is little consideration, if any, on how to tie this rather unorthodox presentation with almost every and any other book in or out of print. In contrast, "Gravitation" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler offers the same geometrical insights in a way that ties nicely with whatever else one is likely to read about tensors and differential forms (two concepts about which Weinreich is mysteriously silent). So if you own Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you do not need Weinreich, and if you don't then you should, in which case you'll avoid Weinreich and learn some relativity theory too. However, after you read Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you may want to check your understanding of some concepts by seeing if you can find their equivalents in Weinreich's idiosyncratic treatment 
 This book is a poor attempt to use the good Atkins name to appear to be related with a true diet genius.  I was surprised when I read that Markham was not only NOT affiliated with Atkins, but Markham had no academic credentials to write this book.   Chiropractors, who I don't trust, believe that they are experts at everything while they don't even like to mention that they are only chiropractors.  Real doctors have MDs after their names and aren't ashamed to use those initials.  Markham, like most chiropractors must be really insecure.  Since they are trained to straighten backs, for whatever that is worth, it makes sense.     Markham lists a bunch of brands that he says he likes.  Paid endoresements are not very useful.   Aurora said that Markham's bungee was cheap enough when better and more versatile units are sold at Big 5 and other stores for much less.  Is Aurora really Markham like Persnickety is?  If Atkins wasn't the real thing then Markham would not have used his name in the title 
 Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me 
 It is exactly this kind of short term mentality in this book, looking on all other countries as enemies instead of friends, that has been isolating the US from the rest of the world. Talking about military intelligence expense and power, no country beats the US 
 Savage Run starts off on a note worthy of Carl Hiaason - a cow explodes and blows up Stewie Woods, environmental extremist, and his bride. The book ends with a good dose of Zane Grey as the protaganist and his companions are chased to an impassable canyon by a deranged killer. In between, two serial killers take out several well-known treehuggers in particularly humiliating ways. All in all, an entertaining concept for a mystery.  What I did not like about this book was the writing, which I thought needed polish. The author seems most interested in portraying the earnest game warden Joe Pickett, a good guy but  prone to costly mistakes. The serial killers are well developed also. But many characters have been drawn straight from central casting - the bad guy lawyer, the sheriff who wants to write off the crime and be done with it, the pretty wife who throws a hissy fit and stamps off to her room. In addition, parts of the book are thoroughly predictable. Will Joe forget to take the evidence and later find that it's disappeared? Is the wife upset because she was involved with Stewie in the past? You could answer without reading the book.  Another problem for me was the descriptions of the crime scenes. Although they include glaring clues, Box expects the reader to accept them as unsolvable. Whether you go along depends upon your tolerance for the highly improbable. Such as authorities wondering if the charred victim set the fire himself. Yeah. First he died, then he poured the gasoline and lit it.    Although I finished this book, I felt it didn't live up to its hype. Mine is a minority opinion though; the other members of my book club loved it.  
 This book did not help at all with the potty training.  My daughter loves Caillou and I thought it might help her figure out the potty.  It didn't 
 This book tries to provide an encyclopedic reference to Latex.  It contains lots of good stuff which I have found useful. HOWEVER it is a dreadful book.  This book was written by Latex gurus but they forgot that for a reference book to work it must index the simple as well as the archane. Trying to find out very simple things you might have forgotten (e.g. what are the allowed Latex charcters) and you spend hours flicking from index to pages on obscure packages. In the end I usually find myself looking it up on the web, until today ... when I vented my spleen by writing this. 
 The movie Psycho is more entertaining and credible than this collage of repressed memories and reincarnation fabrication.  If you start reading the book, make sure to bail out as soon as Baby appears.  The second half of the book bears a striking similarity to the Seinfeld episode in which George fakes an arm twitch.  George's doctor correctly diagnoses George's problem as a mere fabrication, and notes that someone who goes to such effort to fake a medical problem must be a very sick person indeed.  A more appropriate title for the book might have been "A Fabricated Mind".  A couple of high/low-lights of the book:  ï¿½	Bob's pathetic attempts to establish that he is not just your everyday crazy Joe six-pack.  He is at pains to underscore that his mail-order doctorate was achieved in record time.  His claims regarding unrealized archery potential qualifies him to the league of could-have-been Olympic champions if not for...[insert pathetic excuse].  ï¿½	Despite Bob's claimed close association with George H W Bush, the only tangible link between the two seems to be Bush's acknowledgement that he never read an earlier book authored by Oxnam.  I am hoping for Bush's sake that he exercises the same restraint regarding this book.  At least Bush had the common sense not to permit his name to be used in the author's acknowledgements.  I am not surprised that Bush (and other notables including Warren Buffett) have had no association whatsoever with the author since publication of this book.  
 I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...  As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?  What a piece of JUNK 
 I did a little test while I was visiting my Daughter-In-Law, who possesses not only Dryer Balls, but a nice supply of tennis balls. For the test I washed two feather pillows from our motor home, which had become musty during storage. I washed them separately, each with a towel to balance the load. After washing, I dried each set with a dryer sheet in addition to the balls, mostly for fragrance: one set of pillow and towel with the dryer balls and one set with two tennis balls. Both thumped noisily around in the dryer and both walloped the feather pillows and towels back to equal fluffiness. I had considered purchasing dryer balls, but my daughter-in-law contributed the two test tennis balls and I am have been perfectly happy with the results 
 I totally agree with the other reviewers that when it comes to Canadian rock, most of the choice tracks are left out in favour of commercial pap. While "Lay it on the Line" has to be the biggest power rock song of all time from a three man group there are sadly,  a lot of omissions. In addition to the ones mentioned I would also include "Young Enough to Cry" from the "Just a Game" album. A better blues guitar song you will never hear, at least not on this compilation. 
 Poorly written and utterly unoriginal, this book gave nothing by way of practical help or even encouragment.  Honestly, I wasnt even able to finish it.  A total waste of time and money 
 The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the "Acknowledgments" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.  I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket. 
 I thank goodness did not buy this product, but was very tempted.  I want to thank all the honest people for their reviews.. It saved me money and time.  Thank you 
 I bought this thinking it was a cross between a featherbed and one of those space-age memory foam mattress pads.  It wasn't really either, but combined the worst aspects of both.  First, as other reviewers have noted, it does not hold its form past a few days.  But this is useful in some sense, because its initial "form" is uncomfortable.  Imagine four long body pillows stitched together.  Try it lengthwise and you slip into one of the stitching cavities.  Try it crosswise and its like sleeping on four pillows perpendicular to your body.  My wife likes it so it got 2 stars, but I can't stand it.  Also, make sure you have very deep mattress fitted sheets; when you first put this thing on the bed it's monstrously puffy. 
 I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).    I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all 
 I've read as many of Heyer's novels as I can find and there's something to like or love about every one EXCEPT for "Royal Escape". The characters are flat and there is no plot!! I only finished it because I hoped that it would get better and Ms. Heyer's wit would shine through. No luck- I didn't even like the character of the King. please, don't spend time on this when you could be reading the Alastair Trilogy (These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, etc.) or "The Masqueraders", all of which are absolutely marvelous 
 this movie is a great waste of time. with its annoying litle rich brat kids and one of them kills their new best friend and Diggs incestigates with the worst soutern accent in the world, plus he shouldnt of been in this whole mess. with a bitchy cast and a nowhere story, this'll please those people with less than zero brain 
 I remember when I was first introduced to the "Cat Who" mysteries; my High School French teacher's bookshelf was full of them, along with the Mrs. Polifax mysteries and some Inspector Maigret. I enjoyed them, even though they were a little cutesy and it was hard to suspend disbelief at the cats' antics, but I wasn't really driven to keep up with the series.  Now, seeing the book in a cheap pile at Wal-Mart, I figured why not try it--and wow, what a disappointment. It seems to me that the "Cat Who" mysteries actually used to be mysteries, but judging by this one, now they're just cutesy.  It's a sad state of affairs when the blurb of a book is more exciting than the actual book itself. Talked Turkey's blurb implies Qwilleran has to solve an execution-style murder on his property, and somehow the mysterious reappearance of wild turkeys thought long-gone from the area has something to do with it. Well, it doesn't (nor is it ever explained at all, in fact), and the murder is barely even mentioned in the book; the fact that it gets "solved" in the end is more or less coincidental. In actuality, the book is by and large a slice-of-life story about Qwilleran, his cats, and the community. Which is fine if that's the sort of thing you're looking for, but not all that great when the book is being advertised as a "mystery. 
 I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse.   The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.  I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents 
 These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller 
 First, the title reads fine. But there's a catch. This kind of title sounds like it covers all. The truth is. It ain't true. Second. The author's attitude. I'd rather say the author is talking to himself 
 Disappointingly, this uneven collection focuses on relatively marginal writers (e.g, Minette Walters instead of Elizabeth Peters), and has odd emphases.  Does the reader really care in each essay about the religious convictions, real or speculated upon, of every single author?  Charlotte Macleod is noted only as a biographer, and other ignored authors are Sharyn McCrumb, Mary Stewart, Jane Haddam, Dell Shannon...oh, the list is endless 
 I picked up this book in hopes that I would better acquiant myself with the conflicts in our world. This book focuses on 10 hot spots in the world: Bosnia, Cyprus, Karabakh, Kosovo, Palestine, the former USSR, Rwanda & Burundi, Sri Lanka, Transylvania, and Ulster (Northern Ireland). The author tries to give a brief historical background (in many cases an extremely biased and uneducated view) on these regions and then tries to come up with his own solution to these problems ranging anywhere from the partition of land to population exchanges (thank goodness this guy doesn't run the UN!). My advice to everyone out there...spend your money on a better read 
 What do you get when you put nameless terrorists who easily invade top secret military facilities, snakes(which coincidentally often look like rope coiled up) that are smarter than your average actor, and Treat Williams as your biggest star?  The only possible answer is this movie.  Actually calling it a movie would justify it in some sense.  Whatever you do don't rent, buy, or borrow this trash.  It isn't even a movie you can laugh at most of the time.  The belief that this is filmmaking (even bad filmmaking) saddens me 
 Major points of Webbs work Slaves, Women and Homosexuals a Cultural Analysis  Webb is exploring the hermeneutics of cultural analysis.  His desire is to be more culture oriented in our understanding of the biblical texts and more culture oriented in our 21st century application. His premise is that in the evangelical community there needs to be greater understanding of the Biblical documents in light of their real life application in their context.  Unless we do so we are at odds as to how to clearly interpret the scriptures and apply them in our day.  The Major features of his particular hermeneutic are to embrace a "redemptive movement hermeneutic".  This is '"Moving the contemporary appropriation of the text beyond its original application framing." " Sometimes doing the text "living out the Bible's literal words in our modern context fails to fulfill its redemptive spirit.""  For example if we were to live out the spoils of war ethic today we would fall far short of the redemptive element.  We are far beyond needing a spoils of war ethic in today's world.  "This movement is beyond the original application of the text in the ancient world."  We must distinguish between Kingdom values and Cultural values.   A redemptive movement hermeneutic has 5 components 1. Redemptive movement: Grants the principle that movement is what God initially wanted.  This movement is to bring a more just, more equitable, more loving form. Look at the text in its social context.  Is there movement? Example slaves are to be more fairly treated.  Is the movement preliminary or absolute?  Was fairer treatment of the slaves the end, which God had in mind or was actually the end of slavery what the ultimate ethic would lead us to? Without calling for the abolition of slavery the bible plants seeds which ultimately would bear fruit of its demise.  2. Multilevel ethic:  Moses gave the certificate of divorce but a higher ethic was a loving relationship between husbands and wives.  One ethic i.e. certificate of divorce was okay but one marriage with one husband and wife relationship was the higher and ultimate ethic.  3. Balanced perspective:  The balance is Original Culture/Biblical Instruction/Kingdom Ethic.  We are in process.  What changes in the culture is the text addressing?  "Don't beat your slaves."  Kingdom Ethic: slavery should be abolished, as there is no slavery in the Kingdom of God.  4. Cultural/transcultural assessment.  Is the Biblical text, dealing with cultural issues or transcultural issues?  Gen. 3 "your husband will rule over you."  Is this a cultural issue or one that transcends the culture.  1 Cor "women should cover their heads when praying".  Is this an issue that goes beyond 1st century culture?  5. Underlying spirit within the text.  What is the spirit internal to the text is it restrictive or is it pointing to more openess in the future?  Webb asserts the Bible is written in a pastoral manner.  Paul was addressing problems in his time and in his culture.  When studying 1 Corinthians 6-7 Paul is dealing with 2 different extremes," those who think that sex is as neutral as eating food and the other group who are ascetics."  Paul is not dealing with healthy sexual beings so he deals with the extremes.  The bible only wants to push the envelope as far as possible but no more as to be a burden on the hearers.  The underlying spirit of the text will lead us into greater application later.  The problems Paul dealt with in terms of slavery and women were to be more fully acted upon in the future.  Webb has constructed an elaborate system of 18 criteria by which to judge the major social questions of our day, the issue of women and their place in the church and homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. He approaches both questions and uses this grid to arrive at possible solutions.  It is quite an impressive but laborious methodology.  He basically takes Biblical texts and classifies them by asking questions and interpreting according to the grid.  Is the text providing movement in the culture?  Are there seed ideas in the text, which one could anticipate further development at a future time, which would bring more social change?  What is the basis for the need for some of these biblical instructions is it based in the creation narrative, is it based in the fall or curse narrative, really why is this spiritual condition addressed and what is its origin?   Is the condition cultural or transcultural?  The major text he deals with is 1 Tim 2:12-15.  He states that 2:13 may be transcultural and that 14 is definitely cultural.  It was not Adam who was deceived but Eve.  He sights modern evidences that woman are not more easily deceived then men.  The weight of his argument leads him to conclude that this passage is cultural.  For verse 13 he sights Luther, Calvin, Augustine, Wesley, Chrysostom, J.N.D. Kelley, Guthrie, and at least 10 more theologians who argue the traditional view that the verse is transcultural.  Webb concedes that the verse  "may" be transcultural.  He is willing to butt heads with some pretty big horns.  Verse 14 he again cites many examples of how the church interpreted that mans superiority over women is based on the fact that woman was deceived first.  He then cites scientific evidence to show that women are not any more susceptible to deception than men therefore he concludes that verse 14 is a cultural value in light that in Paul's culture women were less educated and less exposed to their culture because of male domination in society.  He concludes that Paul's reasoning in verse 14 is cultural and not a transcultural value.  After using his 18 criteria his bottom line assessment is that women should be allowed to teach in the church.  Most of the male domination in both the Old and New Testament is base on cultural values rather than transcultural values.  Concerning the issue of homosexuality he concludes that there is no redemptive hermeneutical movement, which would lead to an acceptance of homosexuality in the church.  Most of the passages on this issue tend to be restrictive and leave very little room for future openess.  This book reminds me of an alcoholic who expounds the benefits of drinking.  You want to believe him but the facts and evidence do not support his conclusions on the womens issue.  In addressing the womans issue my personal belief is that woman are equal to men as persons.  They are in no way inferior and personally woman tend to be superior to men in many respects.   That being said I have never really read a book that I felt was more "forced" in all my life.  Webb talks about finding the underlying spirit of the text.  I honestly don't think he does that at all. The underlying spirit of the text seems to be evident but the way Webb gets around it is that he tends to isolate every text like 1 Cor 11:2-16 or 1 Tim 2:13-15, or Gen 3, and attacks each one piecemeal without seeing the the weight of all those texts and many others together. But in many cases if you give Webb the perverbial inch and he takes a mile and actually he take much more than a mile.  I think he reads a lot more into the text than what God actually intended.   On the homosexual issue I believe that homosexuals are loved by the Lord as much as heterosexuals are. Webb basically agrees with traditional interpretation. I agree with him as well.  Even though I may not agree with the homosexual lifestyle as Christians we must love them unconditionally.    
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 Keanu Reeves took this part just after he had done the Matrix movies, and many complained that this movie looked so much like the part he played in those other films.  There is little to admire with this movie.  It is insulting to people's beliefs (it was actually banned from showing by many countries in the Middle East due to the subject matter), and beyond the all too noticeable CG effects, there is no story nor script here at all.  One must feel sorry for Rachel Weisz, because she is trying so hard to play a good character here, but without a script, it is all pointless 
 I bought this book because it had the Booker sticker, a beautiful cover and it was by an Irish writer, all good indicators. The book is 185 pages that seem like 500. It is well written, and knows it is, and unengaging. Here are its basic problems:  1) The main character is totally, completely and absolutely dull and unsympathetic. Who cares about him and his memories of the drowning of someone he had a crush on? He is an unimaginative, cold, self-involved and thoughtless little person but he is not so much so as to be interesting. Sometimes writers who do nothing but write forget that their inner experience just isn't compelling to people who live a life that is engaged with others and with the world.  2) It is well-written but knows it is. There are needless passages which look at themselves and seem say "gosh, that's good writing". These passages come off as precious grad school passages. They describe in manicured poetry the uninteresting thoughts of an uninteresting character.   3) Our experiences are not interesting just by virtue of having them. Beautiful, heart string writing don't make them more interesting, it just says to the reader "I can write". But there are many human stories that are very compelling ...   4) It's a memory, not a story. That's really really a problem for the poor reader 
 These essayists (Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, Rashid Khalidi and Edward Said and others), consider all previous historical accounts "Zionist propaganda," as Yehoshua Porath observes in his important summer, 2002 review in Azure. Actually, this book is propaganda, not the reverse. These essays weakly attempt to recast Israel's 1947 and 1948 fight for survival--and fail.  There is nothing new to the idea that Israel instigated the flight of Arabs from Israel in 1947 and 1948,  but the falsity of these accusations has been proved time and again by extensive historical research since 1948. Israel did not deliberately expel Arabs.   Taken on together, or case by case, such claims are easily disproved. Inhabitants of Saffuriya, for example, accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing. But in the 1930s, the village hosted anti-Jewish radicals and in 1948 it was headquarters for Arab Liberation Army leader Fawzi al-Qawuqji, who ignored the June 11, 1948 U.N. truce. Thus inhabitants fled en masse, expecting "revenge for their numerous onslaughts upon Jews," --before the IDF captured the village, according to historical documents, military orders, oral testimonies and diaries cited in Yoav Gelber's Palestine 1948 (p. 165).   These authors also accuse Israel by selectively citing certain items but neglecting critical contextual factors that disprove their allegations.   Contrary to this book's contention, "civil war in Palestine" did not "break out" on Nov. 30, 1947. The "outbreak" wasn't spontaneous, but a well organized series of Arab riots and attacks targeting Jewish communities and people after Arab commanders, leaders and neighboring nations rejected the U. N. Partition Plan--which Israel had just accepted.   These authors, like many other anti-Israel dogmatists, harp on 100 Arabs killed at Deir Yassin. They neglect to mention that the village was a militant stronghold, and was central to Arab attacks on the roads to Jerusalem, intended to cut off the city's access to Jews. Iraqi combatants had settled in Deir Yassin, and joined local aggressors. Arab men dressed in women's clothes and opened fire. They weren't innocent civilians. Likewise, Arabs at a Haifa refinery murdered 50 Jewish civilian co-workers on Dec. 30, 1947 and Arabs slaughtered 80 civilian Jewish medical workers and professors on Apr. 13, 1948. The sole motivation were the victims' Jewish faith.   For his part, Rashid Khalidi focuses on 1948 Palestinian Arab failures--criticizing Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini. Yet he ignores Haj Amin's alliance with Hitler, his wartime refuge in Berlin, his anti-Jewish Berlin radio broadcasts, and his personal request that Hitler refuse to spare 400,000 Hungarian Jews in exchange for military supplies. Haj Amin also elicited a Nazi promise to exterminate Israel's Jews. Nor does Khalidi mention Palestinian Arab murders of all but two 131 prisoners who surrendered at Etzion Bloc.  Avi Shlaim claims that Jewish soldiers vastly outnumbered 25,000 Arab soldiers. But as Porath notes, Israel's Jewish people totaled no more than 750,000, could find no more fighters, and exhausted their resources mounting their self-defense, while seven Arab nations opposing them could easily have drafted far more soldiers from their combined populations of more than 50 million.   Finally, comes the late Edward Said, writing on his family's "flight" from Jerusalem's Talbieh neighborhood. The details confirm--like many 1948, 1949 and 1950 Arab newspaper articles, radio broadcasts, U.N. and Arab League statements and personal Arab accounts--that Arab leaders' urgent calls for Palestinian flight, resulted in massive, voluntary urban Palestinian departures. Said claims to have been forced to leave. His own details contradict him.   Despite these essayists claims, 1947 and 1948 Arab attacks on Jews were very significant, and existential threats, just like frequent publicly announced plans to destroy Israel at its birth.   This book is junk.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 I am not a John Wayne fan, and believe other reviewers who have pointed out the inaccuracies in 'Flying Tigers', but I'd like to have the DVD just to take me back to a time (1942) when, at the age of six, I was left with a friend in the United Artists theater on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, to watch my very first movies - this one, and 'Bambi'.  I entered that movie house a dedicated, blood-thirsty fan of blowing enemy folks to bits, and left horrified by having repeatedly watched pilots get their faces shot off behind broken canopy glass.  I had not realized there was so much bleeding in war, and that death might actually happen. Upon returning home, I told my mother, who would die, of TB, the following year, that I had become a pacifist.  'Uh huh'. she replied, knowing well my sanguinary inclinations. Of course, she was right - before very long, I was happily imagining myself flying a B-17 and creating firestorms all over Europe.  This is a VERY good movie for young children to see 
 Aimed squarely at the computer-guy type it's totally a bore for this car-guy.  The actual projects were kind of interesting but too many of them had the same formula: Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions.  If you can buy a kit, read instructions and install something, you don't need this book.  If you feel that buying a kit, reading instructions, and installing something is hard for you, here is the advice from the book....  Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions. The paper even felt cheap.  Also, instead of finding illustrations or pictures of the projects actually built and installed in a car, there were a few totally blank pages.  Publishing error?  I hope so.    
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 I'll keep this review as short as possible due to this book being a very disappointing read.  I did read it with anticipation and an open mind hoping to uncover some gems of wisdom or valuable insights, what I found however as I read on was disappointing beyond words.  Joan Borysenko has a way of talking things down, making many generalisations along the way and often belittling other views on spirituality. This might have been forgiven if she had delivered a strong counter argument and provided us with a solid read however, Borysenko really did not support her theories and argument in any convincing way shape or form at all.  This book will also be quite disappointing for the intelligent woman, it should be re-titled A girls journey to God.  I was expecting more, much more, what I was left with was  a feeling of being let down instead.  I recomend potential readers to look elsewhere as this book plainly fails to deliver 
 These guyz totally suck ballllzzzz. They can't play. They can't even spell their name write. Shouldnt it be MegaDEATH? Losers. And they play solos, but they sound like their just moving there fingers all over the guitar  strings. And they have LONG HAIR!!!! That's the worst part. Listen to good music like Fall Out Boy and Dashboard Confessional!!! 
 It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey. 
 I hated this movie, it was so boring, I hated his love interest she was too "quirky", this is a poorly written mass of bad jokes, idiotic parents and it was supposed to be in the 70's? I couldnt tell. Dustin Hoffman hasnt been in a good film since the 80's, and he is starting to look like a woman. Susan Sarandon, she is just worn out and obviously cant get any big named roles either. 
 I've watched Mark Bittman on PBS and really liked his style.  I have some cooking skills, but would like to be better and thought this book would be a good start.  I was wrong.  I tried a couple of recipes and they all failed.  The eggplant saute and the boiled shrimp were waaay off in their instructions and were inedible. This is not a good book.  I would recommend Cooks Illustrated magazine and At Blanchard's Table.  These have been great resources for me to help me improve my cooking skills and understand why certain things are done certain ways.  Plus there's always the Alton Brown show Good Eats on the FoodNetwork 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 I think that Chip Davis has run out of creativity with this pitiful offering.  Of the thousands of CDs that I own, the original Mannheim Christmas is among my favorites.  This is about as opposite in my collection as one could get.  Great concept, poor realization 
 The author's approach is natural and meditative but lacks a step-by-step strategy.  For those looking for steps to recovery, I suggest reading the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.  This is THE founding text from which all other  12-step recovery programs began.  Believe me, a recovering alcoholic, I  found the SOLUTION in the 12-steps and with other recovering people.  It  saved millions of lives as well as my own 
 Big disappointment. Unlike previous Panasonic phones that have always been 'slightly ahead of their time' this phone is difficult to use and there are too many steps involved to make or take a simple phone call. It's designed as badly as MS software. One of the annoying features is you have to hold the button down for almost 3 seconds to take a call on hold - it's a mess. Stay away 
 Cooking Pleasures magazine is the magazine produced by the Cooking Club of America. I very happily joined Cooking Club of America, and began receiving this magazine quite a while ago. The Club offers so much to its subscribers, but as time wore on, I could see that the Marketing Department was a tad too aggressive for my taste.  The Cooking Club of America offers their potential members numerous items to entice them to join. Members can take part in member-only contests where kitchen products and gift baskets are some of the prizes. They can be sent food items or kitchen products to review. They can also receive a cheese grater for joining!   There are some nice photographs in this publication. The recipes are not complicated either, although they do require some unusual ingredients and some that are very expensive that many people would find hard to locate. I, personally, had to forego some recipes, and others; I had to order a couple of ingredients online, because of the reasons given.  The cheese grater sent to you is a nice idea, but being it is a rotary grater, you have to squeeze very hard to get the cheese to grate. Also, the grater is made of plastic and eventually snaps in half after using it only a handful of times.  The Club also offers you a Culinary Resource Directory. The information contained in this directory is not difficult to find in a basic Internet search. You can also receive standard sized blank recipe cards. Unfortunately, due to the size of recipe cards, I do not believe anyone can even write the ingredients onto them without running out of space.   Also, part of the member benefits is to sample products for review. Potential members can see photographs of blenders, ice cream makers and much more. While a member there for three years, I did have the opportunity to review quick rise yeast and a chipotle spice. Both were nice products. They were not the glamorous photos of kitchen appliances, but it was something!  Currently, they are offering a VISA credit card with their logo. With this card, not only can you use the card like any other credit card, but also you can receive club discounts. If this is something that appeals to you, see the Club for details.  Approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription, they start mailing you about how you should renew your membership for the following year now, so that you can help them keep club costs down. After just paying for the current year, I was not interested in paying for another year already. An idea may be to NOT contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions. That may save the club some money.  I have Caller ID, and I utilize it all the time, screening my calls to specifically avoid telemarketing calls. Imagine my surprise when I pick up a call and it was a representative for Cooking Club of America. I was, actually, pleasantly surprised, thinking I was about to embark on another benefit of being a member. I was most disappointed to hear the mono-toned voice on the other end of the line, reading the script, suggesting I become a Lifetime Member now. When I tell them I am not interested, they have a "new" deal for me. When I still tell them I am not interested, they have yet another deal. The calls continued after this conversation for another couple of months.   At this point, my subscription has expired. I was relieved as the telemarketing phone call really turned me off. You should have been there to see me receive my credit card statement. Cooking Club of America automatically charged my credit card with my next subscription without my permission. It was three months after my original subscription expired! As you can imagine, this was extremely upsetting.  Upon doing my research for this article, I have come to find that others have had similar experiences with this magazine. It's a shame too, as this magazine has plenty of potential. Unfortunately, their marketing department could utilize different tactics in maintaining their current membership.  Despite this magazine being very affordable, I recommend that you save your money on this one and try Fine Cooking, Cuisine at Home or Cook's Illustrated. Not only do these magazines provide better recipes, more professional tips, they also do not call you daily to get your money 
 The case is waterproof, I'll give them that, but the earphones just don't work when swimming.  The plastic seals that *should* fit in your ear don't.  They have hard ridges that don't form a water tight seal, water leaks in and you can't hear the music or the sound is muffled (even at 30, the highest setting).  I wish I could return the whole darn thing 
 I bought this album because i loved their self titled debut. Unfortunately, it really is nothing like their first album. There is only a hint of bluegrass sound, Chris Thile's vocals are straying into an alt-pop sound, and frankly, many of the lyrics are painfully insipid. Too bad, their first album was (and still is) one of my favorites. If you liked Nickel Creek (the album) for it's unique sound, don't buy this one 
 If you're looking for ammunition to disprove popular conspiracy theories this is not the book you need.  This book is primarily concerned with Christian conspiracy theories based on speculation concerning Biblical end-time prophecies.  The author, apparently himself a devout Christian, comes out squarely against these theories, feeling they create much fear and hopelessness among believers and are therefore contrary to the teachings of Christ, if not his apostles.  As for the more generally known conspiracy theories such as the JFK assassination cover-up, the McVeigh as fall guy for a larger plot, the massacre at Waco, he says very little to put the issue to rest except to list these theories along with a group of other theories which he thinks very little of and therefore dismisses.  He does uncover a few facts I was unfamiliar with.  For example, Janet Reno was moved to okay the Waco attack out of an extreme concern for the children allegedly abused by Koresh.  Why it was better for them to be dead is not part of his treatise.  Altogether, the book was disappointing to me because I expected a worthy rebuttal of theories which have been bothering us for so long.  Instead, I learned a few interesting tidbits about how various Christian groups or sects have interpreted the apocalyptic messages of the Bible 
 This is your typical remix album, where a bunch of DJ's take a really good bunch of songs and mix, and mash them up until it sounds like crap. The original songs sounded so great, why mess with that? Also there's a lot of rapping on the album which isn't that great. I'm so tired of R&B hip hop rap, and there's plenty of it on this album.  There's one really good song, "My December", which is classic Linkin Park. They could have made a whole new album based on this song.  When's Linkin Park coming out with a new album?! 
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 I have never paid this much for a book with poor grammer and editing in nearly every page. Perhaps because the material is cutting edge they chose to rush this book to print. Not only is the copy bad, there are many places (like the entire appendix) where figures are referenced but do not exist. Despite this, the book contains some great information about the emerging security threats to web services and some measures you can take to preempt them. I applaud the author for his technical content, but the book itself needs a lot of work before you should pay this much for it 
 About the only thing I got from this author is that she suffered from compulsive eating. I agree that you must learn to love yourself, but this woman gives no concrete information on how to do that. I read most of her books about 3 years ago, and even went to one of her seminars. The only thing I learned is that she is rude in person, and the seminar was like one big infomercial pushing her other books. I saw a lot of others there who were struggling with compulsive eating, which was helpful, but we all left feeling like, "now what?". I finally found OA, and am experiencing real recovery. This book wasn't a complete waste of time, because it sent me into another direction to find a program which actually helps me 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 This book is simply unfortunate. Firstly, if this book is the first book you have read by this author, and if you are so disappointed by it that you do not want to read any of his other work you will be doing yourself a grave disservice. When Coelho writes from his heart and not his vanity he is an amazing storyteller. Thus, this book is not representative of some of his previous work, which is quite excellent. With this book it seemed that he felt that people love his books so much that they would also love reading about his process in writing his books, and not just that he uses the book as an autobiographical tale. Major problems for me with this book were that clearly the author and the main male character are one in the same. Coelho never admits this, but he has flagrantly made the character so similar to himself that it is insanely ridiculous that he is not recognizing this as an autobiography of some sort. Secondly, the characters are dreadfully and tediously boring, and mentioning the Eiffel tower, his success, fame, money, loyal readership, and open marriage a gazillion times doesn't change this fact. Thirdly, he somehow has convinced himself that breaking up with someone that you have spent a decade of your life with, and then thinking about them and missing them is obsessive instead of a natural part of grieving a broken heart, this makes the whole zahir story line quite ridiculous. Fourth, what has come across as bits of insightful wisdom in his other books seem forced and contrived in this story, because everything else in the book is so ludricrous. Lastly, the story of his missing/runaway wife made no sense to me, and no matter how much I tried to sympathize with something in the storyline I was not able to. If you are interested in knowing many details, however boring they may be, about the author's life this book will fulfill what you are looking for. Otherwise, I agree that it really is something to be borrowed, because paying for this book would be a sad waste of money, and you would already be wasting your time by reading it. Why waste both 
 I had quite high hopes for this little kit given the phenomenal Dragonology. However, it is genuinely disappointing. The kit includes a nice plastic talisman with crystal, a package of dragon powder, a dragon rune decoder and a small 2 inch x 2 inch book of spells. For the suggested retail of $8.99, it's pretty overpriced, and the items are small enough that one wonders why they weren't incorporated into the Dragonology books in the first place. Surely with three books, filled with secret compartments, one could have found space for these 
 While reading this book I found that I was rolling my eyes every page. The author rambles on relating tidbits of information that don't seem to fit together at all and are, at best, poorly organized with no discernable order (chronological, by topic, context, etc). I have no way of verifying the authenticity of most of the information (it is after all a book on secret intelligence), but I know that some of the stories are so inconsistent as to make all the information in the book suspect. 
 A truly horrible book. It claims to be "very, very hard SF", but almost all important features of the plot are completely implausible. A lot of buzzwords are thrown around, and basic understanding of certain principles is demonstrated, but real understanding of the fundamentals is completely lacking. The characters are completely flat and have no depth or complexity. The dialogue is easy to read, but not realistic at all. Most aspects of the book simply didn't make sense. I'm still not sure why I forced myself to read the whole thing 
 I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil 
 I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received. 
 I listened to the cd. My son played it in the cd player and it sounded like a European type of flute melody. As I viewd the CD I realized the flute palyer is not A Japanese, but a European. I sent it back to Amazon.  You too will hear the difference.  
 As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect.  However, the story is so-so.  There are much better reads out there 
 First of all, shame on the women who gave this book glowing reviews on the first few pages!  I was completely shocked (had to re-read the passages several times) by the authors suggestion that a woman who was sexually approached by a co-worker basicallly overreacted by becoming angry, and that she should have instead interpreted the pass as his awkward attempt to "find some way to connect with her.  Might she have deflected the pass but turned the attempt into something more suitable to a collegial work relationship?"(page126)  Give me a break!  I can't believe that this example of gaining influence over people ever made it past the editor.  And if that wasn't bad enough, they again insulted women on page 226, when they explain that a women ponders her failure in a management role by saying "I still haven't figured out why they allowed a female - especially one without an engineering background - to manage the project".  What?!?  I had to check the front of the book to see if it was published in the 60s!  Besides these profoundly ignorant examples, I found the book to be less than marginal in developing my ability to influence those around me.  I'll look elsewhere 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 For those people who didn't make it through the book, here is a (perhaps oversimplified) summary.  Assumption 1 : Machines function algorithmically. The human brain functions at least partly non-algorithmically   Assumption 2 : There are some mathematical problems that can not be solved by algorithms f.i. proving the correctness of a self-referring statement.   Conclusion from 1 and 2 : Humans are able to solve problems that machines will never be able to solve.  Assumption 3 : Intelligence means being able to solve every possible problem.  Conclusion : Humans are intelligent, machines will never be intelligent.  My thoughts on this :  assumption 1 : Non-algorithmically ? There is not a shred of evidence of non-algorithmic thinking in humans. There are on the other hand plenty of mechanisms taking place in the brain that are clearly algorithmic (like vision, pattern recognition etc.)  assumption 2 :  Apparently Penrose believes that humans are able to solve these problems. I am not so sure. I challenge you to answer the next question correctly : Will you answer "no" to this question ? It cannot be answered correctly. It is in the nature of the problem itself. The problems Penrose mentions are of the same nature.  assumption 3 : We don't know the nature of consciousness. We have no understanding of what intelligence implies. Penrose believes it implies that an intelligent creature is able to solve EVERY problem. Therefore, if there is one problem a machine can not solve, the machine is not intelligent. So the only thing Penrose has to do to prove his point is ask a question that has no correct answers : ask the machine to overcome the incompleteness theorem of G?del, or to answer the above question correctly. (and ignore the fact that people cannot answer it correctly either).  I have enjoyed the book in a way ... while seeking arguments to demolish Penrose's theory. 
 I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.  I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone 
 This book has lots of good advice for those navigating the college years. However, this book is homophobic, and therefore, I must give it a poor rating. Preaching hate is not what I want to find in a Christian book. The book offers bad advice on how to treat homosexuals, and has no advice for homosexuals reading the book 
 I recall seeing this movie in a theater way back in 1981, when it was first released, and thinking (at the time) that it was very entertaining. In a fit of nostalgia, I recently rented the DVD and discovered that my initial, youthful impression was way off base. Like Shelly Winters and fish, this movie does not age well.  I have always been a great fan of Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot was a classic) and would have sworn that he never appeared in a bad movie....until I (re)saw this one. Bridges plays a gigolo/boat salesman who never works or commits to anything, which becomes quite tiresome as the movie progresses. His life is a sham and he constantly seeks the easy way out. I can accept this, but would have preferred some growth, some improvement in his character as the movie progresses. None is forthcoming. Worst of all, he lacks the sly, roguish charm we always expect from old Jeff...he is simply a boring, loutish, manipulative loser.  John Heard, appearing rather young and slim (compared to now) is ridiculously loud and obnoxious as the title character, Cutter: a badly injured Viet Nam vet who uses his disabilities as an excuse whenever his foul, drunken mouth gets him in trouble (which is often). Shouting and cursing is simply not acting...if it were, we could all be stars, and in this case, while I believe we are meant to find Cutter to be a troubled but amusing character, he is simply repugnant. It has been suggested that Heard deserved an academy award for his performance, but was not even nominated (big surprise), perhaps for "political" reasons. I contend that he was not nominated because his grating, annoying performance never rose above the level of school yard tantrum. It was awful. I would submit to root canal surgery rather than endure another minute of his ranting dialog.  The only good characterization is by Lisa Eichorn, as Heard/Cutter's long suffering, alcoholic (who could blame her?) wife, who seems strangely amused and tolerant of his boisterous, annoying behavior. Perhaps she knows a side of him that is simply not presented in the movie. She presents a vulnerable, touching performance....the only redeeming virtue in this otherwise unremarkable movie.   The plot is extremely slow moving, centering around the brief and indistinct witnessing by Bridges' character of the disposal of a murder victim. The very next day (what a coincidence !!!), while attending a parade, he believes that he sees the murderer, who happens to be a rich and powerful man. Rather than go to the police with their hunch, Cutter hatches a hair-brained plot to blackmail the rich guy....if he pays, then he must be guilty. He also enlists the help of the murder victim's sister, who seems totally unemotional, considering that her sister was brutally murdered two days before, and acts like she is along on a field trip to the zoo....which is no real problem, since she simply disappears from the cast long before the conclusion.   The characters spend what seems like hours arguing, harranging, shoving, and degrading each other while they try to hatch their flimsy plot. Several times, my finger was poised over the "STOP" button on my DVD control, itching to put an end to this increasingly annoying shout-fest. I stuck it out to the climax, which is so unlikely, so utterly preposterous that it leaves you shaking your head in disbelief. I, like many of the other reviewers, must have been blinded by nostalgia, but harsh reality is that this is simply not a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this turkey....other than watching Lisa Eichorn, it really, really, really isn't worth the time or effort. 
 I read it to my 3 year old grandaughter and she was not very responsive. I think it is hard for a 3 year old to relate to. She didn't want to read it again and frankly neither did I. I was alittle surprised by the refernce to "a black man singing in the west" She doesn't even know there are differences between white men, black men or green men. I will read it again when she expresses an interest and next time I'll just say " a man singing in the west"  
 Everything reviewer Lisa A. Lassner said below and more.  This book is written like a neverending, obnoxious Cosmo or Glamour article.  It tries to be "girlfriend to girlfriend" and it just comes off as ridiculous.  Everything positive that I got out of "Unmarried to Each Other" was shaken by this book because of its "no legal marriage = no commitment" attitude.  Devoting ONE chapter at the end of the book to alternative couples is just insulting.  It's light on research, light on footnotes and light on reality.  Seriously, get "Unmarried to Each Other: The Essential Guide to Living with Each Other as an Unmarried Couple" instead.  Pair it with "Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples" and you have a winning combination that blows this book out of the water 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 This book is heavily mis-titled.  It does not offer any alternatives at all.  The book is merely a compilation of rants and raves about the current world system.  The people who compiled this book are clearly unhappy with how things are going with the present situation in the global economy.  But, they do not know what to do about it.  So, it's not worth reading.  
 To the reviewer who thinks these are the originals, I "just want you to know" (lol) that this is NOT the original "Take It Easy On Me".  I have the first greatest hits album and it's awesome.  I've listened to those songs over and over and I can tell just from this sound clip that it's not the same version.  Listen to the phrasing and the way the singer holds the notes when he sings "I'm getting lost in the crowd" and it's TOTALLY obvious.  What a disgrace.    I also agree with the reviewer who commented on the change in the order...it was perfect before.  I knew the song "Cool Change" from when it was originally released, but hearing it on the first greatest hits album, as the finale, really made me appreciate what an amazing song it is...now my absolute favorite by LRB.  Again...disgraceful.  I will admit that I DO NOT own this CD, but I gave it a low rating because I am disgusted by what they've done to this great compilation.  And, from a completely different point of view, let's pretend that this re-release isn't a total debacle...let's say it was a fantastic re-do.  It's REALLY annoying to those of us who bought the original greatest hits to have one that would now be outdated...have the decency to rename it or, at the very least, change the album cover!!!  A wag of the finger to you! 
 Ordered a new pen and pencil set, opened the box only to see "Made in China". I dont even want them now 
 Many of my friends and I have read the same book.We come to the same conclusion of this book having an agenda to dogmatize our country with meaningless gender bias.In my opinion there is nothing more dangerous to a country and the world as to limit  our children's ability to wether the child is male or female. Gurian does not offer any proof as others have stated in the  reviews as to how these differences come about.He says it's the hormones,the brain structure.I have read other matierial which has disclosed findings which condradict his so called research. If he were correct in assuming hormones then I would be much more drenched with testostrone than my half brother since I excell at math and he at lanuage.Brain structure varies from person to person,something I doubt he would like you to know. Instill independence and individuality in all your children  by seeing them as people rather than sexes. I cannot think of anything worse than leading your child down the wrong "learning style" road,simply because of their sex. People tend to want to agree with anything they read  and be  a good follower.It's better to think for yourself and be a  good leader and helper in your child's life by giving them room to grow the way they want to and without trying to controll  their interests or believing they will only show talent in small sterotyped boxes.Terrible book written by someone  who is trying to distort your child's life to make $$$$$$ 
 This is a terrible movie that I gave 1 star because I couldn't give any fewer. It features the usual idols given primarily to the black youth of today, hip hoppers playing gangstas who have no respect for anything or anyone other than money. It is another one of those blaxploitation specials in which there is literally no figure of any redeeming value. This explains the  almost endless series of beatings, shootings, and overall ignorance portrayed in sequence, and served up as some sort of story. It's only entertainment they say, but they are typecast without even knowing it, foolishly dying to portray a fantasy image...psychologically bound as tight as any slave was ever shackeled 
 Lacks any gripping force and it is an effort to work thru i 
 I'm not sure.  Maybe it's because I'm not a Gurdjieff follower or studier, but this particular book seemed like it was written by the founder of the Ego Strokers Anonymous Club.  Throughout, Gurdjieff doesn't talk as much about other remarkable men as how remarkable he himself is in these meetings with these others.    He consistently portrays himself as a sage, a knowledgeable business man as well as mystic philosopher.  He's just good at everything gosh darnit!  Not my cup of tea, but then again, maybe Gurdjieff wrote this book in a manner that it would only appeal to his real followers.    Whatever, in the end I persisted through it and was very disappointed- I found no good messages. In fact I barely underlined a single kernel of mystical, business or any other wisdom.  Rather unfortunately, I ended up making notes in the margins to dispute some of his arrogant assumptions and "know-it-all" expressions.  Perhaps I'll find one of his worthwhile works at some other point in my travels, but I doubt I'll ever come back to this one to look for anything. 
 Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces. 
 This book is an uninspiring analysis of Smith's work.  Nobody who has even a cursory knowledge of Smith's writings would be surprised by what Muller has to say.  The basic point that Smith was not a philosopher of unbridled greed is unsurprising.  It is not that the thesis of the book is wrong, but it is simply something that could have been said in an article or less.  Obviously a lot of hard work went into the book, but it is the product of a mediocre mind 
 Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins "Colors of the day" has bad mastering. The tape Elektra used was obviously played back with Dolby-C, while not encoded as such. This disc should have been taken off the market. Try and find the gold disc instead 
 Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it. 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 Be forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is "even better"--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)  I once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was "better than ever." I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)  All that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot). CAVEAT EMPTOR! 
 Once again, Carr's central truth is: To know how the addiction works is to be free of it.   Unfortunately this is simply a false dawn.  The greater the need for a solution, the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem.  This is not to say the book contains nothing of worth. But Carr's demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment. We are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease. 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 There are better Cary Grant movies out there to watch. This one is just about ok. The movie DVD is released by various companies. I had the BFC edition, and was not very thrilled by the print 
 It's a shame that such a wonderful book was translated so poorly.  The translator, Alicia Dellepiane, has a tendency to translate literally.  For example, she translated to "have a fit" (referring to the baby, Dudley, on the second page of the book), as "tenía un berrinche." In Mexico it's "hacía un berrinche" and in much of Latin America it's "daba un berrinche."  Errors such as this one abound.  It's awkward for readers who know Spanish well and misleading for those who might pick up this book to study Spanish.   I rate the English version as five star 
 This is literally the ONLY Prince album that gets less than three stars from me, y'all. I love the man an' his eccentric genius, but the material here was just not hittin' for me. It's flawlessly performed as all his work is (the man is the most sheer perfectionist in the biz, which makes his incredibly-prolific output all the more impressive an' mind-blowing), but, in spite of it all, this one jus' left me flat an' uninspired. The stabs at electro-rock an' rap on 'Loose' an' 'Race' respectively jus' don't do it for me on this outing (the latter topic he tackled to much better effect on his next effort in the form of 'We March') an' even a slower ballad like 'Space', while technically well-crafted, lacks the real SOUL to get you enthusiastic about it. This album's definitely dark as others have mentioned an' not for mainstream appeal, but thas' NOT why I don't really like it (y'all should know me by now!). And as I keep stressing its flawlessly-performed. My disappointment is in the sheer BLANDNESS of its perfection. (Yea, so maybe that doesn't make sense, but it sounded good in my head, so I'm stickin' with it!)      There are however two tittilating numbers on here that make this almost worth having. The grandiose epic title track 'Come' for those "18 an' over", is a slinky 10-minute-plus groove with a hypnotic horn-and-rhythm section. The other is the searing story of parental abuse an' neglect he tells on 'Papa'. Prince has the amazing ability to find new ways to sum up life an' mankind in general with jus' a couple lines, an' he does this on jus' about every album, even the lesser ones like this one. Here on 'Papa' he gives us words to live by: "Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same, Every single one of us knows some kind of pain." 
 I was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes.  If you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand, manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit.  I found it to be off-topic for me as I was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who Think for a Living rather than their managers. 
 This book was a waste of good money. While it did provide a number of facts supporting VBAC - it also implied that midwives were to be trusted over doctors, that birthing centers and home births were preferable to what was labeled dispargingly as "a high tech birth" (ie: a hospital setting.) Women are encouraged to labor naturally and are threatened that if they give in to the nefarious epidural that they will have their labor stall and will find themselves undergoing a second c-section. Should you attempt a VBAC and end up in c-section anyway - the book informs you that your child will be at risk for a lengthy stay in NICU due to breathing problems. Diana Korte is a medical journalist - not a physician. She should be more objective in her coverage, but any arguement in favor of a second c-section is glossed over and the implication is that doctos want the higher fees of a c-section and that women who choose a follow up c-section are being self indulgent or are somehow too emotionally inhibited to labor naturally.My first labor ended after a grueling and excruciating labor in an emergency c-section. Had we not gone to c-section my baby would have died. I'm not anxious to have a second c-section and I find that contrary to the suggestion by Korte that if I undergo a second c-section that I shouldn't consider myself a failure, that her book's message is exactly the opposite. For Korte the only safe and joyful birth is a epidural-free, intervention-free, duola and midwife assisted, doctor-free birth 
 ICE PALACE is probably a teenage girl's novel, as the main character is a young woman "coming of age".  The pedantic "facts about Alaska" would also probably be better tolerated by a young reader,  accustomed to the style from school books.  However, the book was  apparently written in the 1950s, and many of the facts, as well as  expressions are dated.  As a middle aged male, I found the novel to be  weak, and I could not recommend it to another adult 
 And what's the deal with the CD cover? Anyway..I have always found her voice to be too breathy,too mannered,and trying too hard to be sexy.I just do not like her singing.I tried.I couldn't get into it.Give me Ella or June or Sarah.Now that's singing.Sorry Krall fans 
 Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish.  I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books. I remember the fascination with the Peyton Place/Grace Metalious hoopla in the 50's and 60's so I was expecting to enjoy this story.  It is dull and tiresome.   
 I was very pleased to finally acquire this book, having heard of it several years ago. Although I'm not an expert in history, I have read a lot of books concerning this period, and always look forward to reading more. My pleasure soon turned to dismay as I started reading. Through the first few chapters I had a growing but unspecific feeling of unease - something about the prose didn't ring true. It was nothing I could put my finger on; aspects of the writing didn't feel authentic.  I persevered. Eventually I stumbled across details that I knew were wrong. For instance, in this period the term "Your Majesty" to address the King or Queen had not yet been introduced. This didn't come about until the time of the Tudors. Plantagenet monarchs were content to be addressed as "Your Grace". Next, Edward IV was several times described as wearing a collar of interlinked S's. Unlikely. Yorkist collars tended to consist of roses and suns - the interlinked S collars were favoured by the Lancastrian nobility. Then in book 2 of the series we were asked to believe there was a Jewish money-lender in Whitby. As this story is set slap bang in the middle of the three hundred and fifty year period during which all Jews were banned from England, I find this hard to believe. Book 3 (which I've read, living as I do outside the US) would have us believe a crescent moon sailed the sky for an entire night. I ask "On which planet?!" A crescent moon when new is seen only at the start of the night, and when waning is only seen in the hours before dawn. The only moon that is seen all night is a full moon.  These known inaccuracies ruined the book for me. I found myself questioning every detail I read. Was it true? Was it authentic? Or was it just a flight of fancy or wishful thinking on behalf of the author? In the end I was unable to finish the 3rd book in the series because I found myself irritated to the point that I no longer cared about the fates of the characters. I'm only grateful that I got the books out of the library rather than spending hard earned cash on them.   I'm left wondering how such glaring errors could make their way into a published book...or am I expecting too much that a work of historical fiction should reflect its setting accurately 
 I still am against the idea of Jason Todd (especially), whose death added another tragic layer to the Batman mythos, returning from the grave.  The impact and fear of losing one's life in a heroic act - the ultimate sacrifice one could make - is almost nil in modern comic books. Characters die and return from the grave almost constantly, an unfortunate cliche that has hurt the mainstream's view of comics-as-art and rendered death as nothing more than a temporary setback for superheroes.   Aside from the very concept itself, Jason's return is also poorly executed.  The new Black Mask, who is woefully out of character, is still present.  The Joker is sacrificed to Jason Todd's credibility.  And how does Jason come back, you ask?  What's the cool creative explanation that isn't a tired IC-related explantion that doesn't fit the Batman universe motif?  *Spoilers*: Superboy-Prime punching the walls of a paradise in another dimension is the explanation.  Jason wakes up in his coffin and digs his highly battered young body out of his coffin and 6ft of dirt using only his belt buckle.  The coffin had sensors that could detect people getting in, but amazingly could not detect people getting out.  What kind of crazy silly sensors are those?  A new coffin is reburied, and the greatest, I repeat greatest, detective in the world, who forensically examines the coffin in all its minutia, neither notices the reburial or the new coffin.  I couldn't make this junk up.  A must not read for batfans, in my opinion.  
 Having read books 1-6, I can confirm that these History books are quite terrible. Often events are told out of order, especially in the stories of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The faulty chronology is very confusing when reading the books. Furthermore, the series are intended for elementary or middle school students, and making it available for such a wide spectrum makes it seem very condescending for those at the higher age range. For example, when describing latitude and longitude, she says to think of the world as a big fat man with a belt around his waist (i.e. the equator). Hakim weaves multi-culti fables, saying that the Americans got their ideas about what to put in the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation from the Iroquios League. That is absurd. Our system of government is based off of Athens, the Roman Republic, English law (minus that whole monarchy business), the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. She states that "some historians" think there may have been as many as 75 million indians (beg pardon, "The First Americans") pre-Columbus, but fails to give a bottom estimate, giving the impression that Europeans wiped out all the Amerindians. All in all, the books are inaccurate, misleading, and demeaning 
 I brought this for my eight year old for Christmas,she began to play with it around Feb.she was having great fun with it until it began to freeze up.I took it back to the store in which I had to wait 1month till one came back in stock,took that one home did great for two weeks,same thing happened again.save your moneybuy something that will actually work for that kind of money 
 I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed 
 I am certain that for readers with a more mature taste this is a fascinating book. Unfortunately if you're looking for a police procedural, not too complicated and entertaining, then this isn't for you 
 This book is one of the medieval costume sources heavily influenced by the Victorian era. Norris' redrawings are changed quite a bit from the originals. He tends to base his thoughts off of the romanticized Victorian view of the middle ages rather than the actual middle ages. What he can't find from that, he just makes up. If you are looking for the "feel" of the middle ages in a halloween costume, this book will be fine. If you are interested in accuracy, you would be better to spend your money elsewhere 
 I was very disappointed that this cookbook didn't have more comfort food recipes.  It used ingredients that you wouldn't normally have on hand.  I was looking for recipes for meatloaf, mac & cheese.  I won't buy another cookbook that I can't review first 
 Having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years, I can assure those who swallow Breggin's nonsense hook, line and sinker that nobody could have "talked" me back to anything resembling "health."  The mental anguish I suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like Breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long.  Financial and insurance considerations aside, talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results.  No doubt pharmaceutical companies often drive treatment trends in a highly questionable manner both via perks to MD-psychiatrists and (the increasingly obnoxious) practice of direct advertising of prescription drugs to the public.  Nevertheless, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety meds and sleep aids HELP relieve the suffering quickly, which is what medicine should be all about, not ideology.  Only one of Breggin's points is valid, and that is the disturbing trend for nearly all MD-psychiatrists to focus on psycho-pharmacology to the exclusion of psychotherapy.  The current treatment model has the patient seeing a psychiatrist for meds management typically quarterly while also seeing a psychologist for psychotherapy anywhere from weekly to monthly.  It would seem that "one stop shopping" would not only make things more convenient for patients, but competence in multiple therapies would also make for a more effective and insightful professional.  Use meds to stablize the patient and minimize the suffering, then pursue cognitive and other talk therapies to provide coping skills and attack the environmental and experiential contributors to the disease. 
 The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be superfluous.  The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful.  Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.  Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch.  Come ON... those are NOT "low carb" ingredients.  This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share.  My copy is being donated to a charity, it isn't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real "low carb" cooking.  
 already reviewed this, but some dingbat in charge thought it might be nice to remove it.  epitaph has officially become a major label in my eyes...the only bands they have now to keep me as a buying customer are bad religion and pennywise..yeah i may buy a rancid or nofx when i damage an old cd of theirs, but otherwise, my epitaph merchandise is coming from second hand sellers since EVERYTHING is going out of print...i know some people will be all like "out with the old and in with the new," but it is one thing to choose to do that, it is another thing to force people because all of the old stuff is going out of print.  i seriously hate epitaph now. they are merely a screamo emo label that happens to contain BR and Penneywise. i recommend everyone buy the first 4 punk o ramas and see what epitaph has discontinued. it really is amazing stuff....i mean i could understand if they upped the price but still kept them in print.  yeah anyways, this comp is very sad....about 35% of it is passable, but the rest is emo/screamo/whiny stuff and even rap????   depeche mode and REM aren't related to this, but i would rather stick to classic indy than the rotting corpse of punk revival 
 After spending 30 minutes with this item, I decided it was hopeless and returned it.  It has a number of problems, most significantly:  1.  The contrast is adjustable, but even at max contrast, the screen is too dim.  2.  The instruction manual is not helpful.  The very first thing you are instructed to do is press the "reset" button - but there is no reset button 
 This mouse is incredibly difficult to use. There's actually only one button: The whole carapace of the mouse. So your hand can't really be relaxed when you're using it, you continually have to concentrate in order to get true right-clicks. In order to get that true right-click, you want to grip the mouse -- but the only place on it that affords gripping without tending to cause false-clicks is the two little pads on the right and left side. Alas, if you grip those (in the default mode), you get Expose, which interrupts your attempt to right-click; if you reflexively follow through with the click, most of the time you'll get switched to another application (because hey, you just clicked on that app window in the Expose screen).  The scroll ball is a nice idea, but it's about half the size it needs to be in order to afford a decent amount of control. Without that, you get all kinds of false directionals (scrolling right/left when you're trying to scroll up/down) And using the scroll-ball to center-click is tricky: as often as not, even after you configure the scroll-ball to click as "button 3", you as often as not get a funky "mouse scrolling" action (an icon appears on screen and you can scroll the currently focused document by moving the mouse pointer -- not a crazy idea, but totally counter-productive when what I wanted to do was open the clicked link in a new tab).   Basically, this is a fussy, fussy device that will be difficult for most people to use. But since is looks so beautiful, they'll blame the problems on themselves and give it a high rating anyway. 
 Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this.  But I hadn't read the book.  About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this  story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself.  It was awful.  Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words.  There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender 
 What? The movies aren't abridged enough? Why not discover the beauty of a real work of literature by actually reading it? Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is moving and entertainingn on its own.  Why let weak prose butcher literature with overly simplistic, inaccurate, and didactic notes 
 I admit it, the 12 steps to Raw foods should have given away that this book is just a rehash of 12 steps.   What I expected was an actual 12 step program to familiarizing myself with raw food, and processes, and grocery lists.   This book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement. It's a little creepy actually. Someone, please suggest me a better raw food book 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Man, these guys suck. I couldn't stand listening to the 30 second samples. Click out of this page and move on with your life 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
      I was reading the reviews for this book, both 11th edition and 10th edition, and was surprised to be the only reviewer that disagrees with the quality of this book. The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably.       The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey "down home" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered.       In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook. If you enjoyed "The Worldly Philosophers" by Robert Heilbronner, you'll like reading this book. But to use it as an Economics textbook, BIG MISTAKE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST TEXTBOOKS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY COLLEGE SUBJECT OUT THERE.      I give it an F or 1 out of 5. 
 Peter Whybrow's finest moments are to be found at the beginning and at the end of this book, in which he provides an eloquent, impassioned and highly quotable critique of contemporary American society.  Ideally, these two sections should be treated as independent essays, because they really don't deserve to go down with the rest of the ship - which, in this case, is a very long exposition of an error-ridden, poorly (though lengthily)defended, and, well, just plain wrong, hypothesis. The short version of Whybrow's thesis is that Americans are "manic" because America was populated by migrants who were curiousity-driven risk-takers, and that, somehow, this resulted in changes in neurobiology which in turn perpetuate (and perhaps create - this was vague) the inability to be satified with "enough."  One might expect this kind of individualistic theory from a psychiatrist, which is a profession that frequently misses the larger picture.  What one doesn't expect is the degree to which Whybrow explores the migrant "mind-set" without offering a shred of evidence for its existence.  (No "evidence" can be offered.  Most of these early migrants are quite thoroughly dead.) Notwithstanding the fact that a significant proportion of migrants came to America against their will (Africans, Chinese, and most women to name a few) there simply is no means to evaluate whether any migrant group anywhere experiences a shift in the activity of neurochemicals.  To claim otherwise is sheer nonsense.  Whybrow makes a fine attempt at appearing to offer support for his claims by quoting from venerable old dinosaurs. Although Whybrow quotes at considerable length from Adam Smith, giving the reader the false impression that Whybrow understands economics, he does not analyze America's manic spending with depth. Instead, he offers a series of broad, well-known statistics about wealth distribution, economic trends, etc, which tell us very little about the actual psychology involved in our supposed spending frenzy.  All this could be forgiven had there been an adequate amount of thought put into the central tenets which form the bulk the book.  But here again, Whybrow falls short.  He tends to rely on popular prejudices more than actual research.  His blythe claim that the fall of Soviet Russia signaled the triumph of laissez faire capitalism over communism stands as one of the more ridiculous statements in the book.  (Not withstanding the very obvious communist elephant in the room - China - no reputable economist on the past 200 years actually treats laissez faire capitalism as anything more than a quaint myth.) His assumption that obesity is somehow related to unbridled greed is equally absurd.  When was the last time you saw an obese CEO? A simple comparative field trip to a McDonald's, and let's say, a high-end French restaurant on the upper east side would have added a vital piece of factual information so deplorably missing from Whybrow's analysis.  For, unlike the exec-moms and financial wiz-kids who Whybrow seems to think are representative samples of "America" your average wage-earner does not suffer from "over-scheduled" children, jet-lagged interpersonal relations, and turbo-charged consumption.    If you want to read a well-written exposition of some of the unfounded myths "explaining" contemporary America, then this book is for you.  If not, then read Jared Diamond, Kevin Phillips, or Chalmers Johnson.  
 I fell in love with Robin McKinley with the novel Beauty, her first write of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  It was an amazing novel, and I was excited to see she had rewritten the tale a second time.  Rose Daughter, however, falls sadly short of McKinley's other work.  The writing style is difficult and choppy to follow, too many sentences are strung together to make the words flow smoothly.  This was the greatest drawback to the novel and made it much inferior to Beauty.  At the story's finish, you realize the novel has only spanned a few days, but it felt like centuries to wade through McKinley's over-wordiness and failing attempts at a more "advanced" writing style.  What is more, Rose Daughter isn't different enough to even have points for originality, or a very clever plot.  I would definitely suggest against purchasing this book, and instead sticking to Beauty 
 I am a big fan of Jim Lehrer, the author, at least and am very disappointed with this book. The book is a very compelling indictment of the treatment of prisoners during wartime, especially those held by the Japanese. These chapters are vividly told and unsettling to read.  That's where the good part ends. Unfortunately the moral dilemma, or question, presented by the author, is weakly supported and ambiguously resolved.  The main character, Bishop Watson, guided by his own sense of morality understand the price he must pay for the taking a life.  But the author chooses to played it out in a farcical trial.  In real life the prosecutor himself would have probably requested an appeal on behalf of the defendant, based on an incredibly inept defense mounted by the bishop's attorney.  The book reads more like a short story with lots of padding. I'm sure it would make a great TV movie. Sorry Jim 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide.  So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.  I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math, geography, ca history etc etc and passed the CSET on the first try.  I am not young..almost 50 
 Science, too, has its dogmatic, closed-minded zealots who attempt to summarily dismiss objective investigations into many human endeavors.  Edwards desparately strives to discredit reincarnation with a priori  reasoning.  When the author's arguments fail to persuade or convince, he  tries character assassination against reincarnation and near-death  researchers and philosophers.  The reader soon realizes Edwards'  intellectual bankruptcy in his efforts to defeat reincarnationist views at  any costs.  The reader learns nothing meaningful for or against  reincarnation in this work; rather, one simply discovers Edwards' personal  agenda against reincarnation.  The author's tone is reminiscent of  fanatical defenses such as one might hear from the flat earth society,  Ptolemic earth-centric universe believers, and those who utterly deny  evolutionary processes.  Edwards' personal attacks against researchers  suggest that he would have been an excellent inquisitor several centuries  ago (reincarnationists, all together now:  "Perhaps he was!").   Seriously, expect no objectivity in this book.  This reviewer recommends  investing in more balanced scientific and philosophical inquiries 
 I am a Time person of the year 2003 (shared title - actively deployed U.S. servicemembers).  I must say that reading Time magazine is like reading the platform for the Democratic Party.  Actually it is even worse than that it is like reading John Dean's diary, filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality.  One of the latest from the online edition is that Realists have taken over Washington.  Give me a break.  A new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it.  Anyone who believes Nancy Pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help America is a fool.  Best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in Washington.  Maybe then they will see that America improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful.  The sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world.  This publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have "learned".  If you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the Economist.  It probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others.  The Economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence.  The articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about.  Leaders from around the world read and contribute to the Economist.  This is something that Time, Newsweek and the rest of their ilk cannot claim.  I am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political.  I look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly 
 I have to agree with the first reviewer.  I loved Making the Connection.  I expected a lot more from this book than what I got.  Instead of going more in depth, it's more superficial than MTC.  In many cases, I felt like  he was just repeating his message from the first book, not offering  additional insight.  I'll never get rid of my copy of MTC, but KTC may end  up going to the used book store 
 I picked up this book after reading the great one-page summary in Outside magazine.  My suggestion is to go and buy the January 2006 issue of Outside magazine and read the great one-page summary.  The summary has many of the best suggestions from the book, but it is concise and well edited.  The first thing that struck me as I glanced through the book was that is consists of 200 pages of almost pure text with very few illustrations and no photos.  As I started plowing through it, I noticed that the prose was littered with an inordinate number of asides and parenthetical comments.  Consider this gem: "So we tend to think runners are better than we are, and because they don't really fight the image (probably more out of preoccupation with their hamstrings than egocentrism, in their defense), that keeps a lot of us - who doubt we're ever going to rule at anything - from running."  At first I assumed that the author was a exercise physiologist who just couldn't write, but then I realized he is a journalist who writes too much.  The book is actually pieced together from articles that appeared in Outside magazine and it reads exactly like one huge magazine article.  The problem is, writing a good book is a lot different than writing a good magazine article.  I would say that about 50 percent of the text could be deleted with no harm done.  The production design of the book is especially poor - it focuses on style rather than substance.  The few illustrations are wasted on highly stylized drawings unsuitable for a technical topic.  There is almost no variation in font size which makes it difficult to pick out main points.  There are no chapter summaries and precious few bulleted lists.  There are some good points in this book if you can find them.  The book covers a wide variety of topics and I did find a few things potentially worth adding to my workout.  Most people, especially beginners, would be better off looking elsewhere.   
 I am a big PJ fan but this was disappointing with a serious lack of content. Start with his best works, Holidays in Hell and Parliament of Whores; then if you really want more work you're way down to this 
 this is the cutest furreal I have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it's mouth. ...Why did it come with a bottle? all ir does is grunt and beg. doesn't walk and it's eyes do not close so you can't pretend it is asleep. I can't return it cause it was a valantine's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig 
 Rule number one in writing for change, according to Mary Pipher, is that you must be a die-hard, lockstep liberal. You must hate "The Man" (i.e. George W. Bush). You must recycle everything. You must fight such things as deforestation and global warming. You must NOT fight such things as political correctness or parenting by village.  I will admit, I barely made it through half of this book. But that was because I got tired of being preached at. Pipher needs to check her own politics and ideals at the door and live by her own words: "I don't want to belong to any club that won't have everyone as a member." Well, Mary, I'm afraid that "everyone" includes conservatives, Republicans, and even conservative Republicans. Every once in a while, we middle-class white males might have a good idea ourselves. But if we listen to what Pipher preaches, we may give up on expressing it. I strongly advise against the purchasing of this book 
 I bought this because it was part of a Sonlight (homeschooling) core curriculum. I was looking for a Christian character lesson/devotional type of book, but I am not impressed with this book. Looking through it, I think we will be  able to use about half the "lessons" which is why I am giving this 2 stars. The language in this book is very dated and not very useful, emphasizing words like "naughty" and "nice". I noticed several pages that seemed to be more about proper social behavior than what I would consider morally "right" or "wrong". An example of this is "being polite by saying please and thank you"; telling someone "it's okay" when they apologize, rather than saying "I forgive you" or talking about what forgiveness means. There is a page on why parents must spank children (in the example given it is because the young child took cleaning supplies with a skull and crossbones marked on them, out of a low cabinet in the picture). There is also a lesson with the example of a child who gets upset over having to leave a fun place, and the child is supposed to pray that she will not "get mad over nothing".  On the positive side, there are very nice pages about helping others and sharing with others, taking care of pets, being thankful and saying regular prayers, telling the truth, etc. I am still looking for a book that is similar but does not condone corporal punishment and is more developmentally appropriate for the preschool age it seems to be written for 
 This book was a HUGE dissapointment for me. I have plenty of "For Dummies" series books and this is the only one that really let me down.   The whole book is written by a person who works for the RFID industry. He does not spend any time explaining the security and privacy issues involved with RFID. He makes a childish remark that "RFID is like credit card, it can be tracked"...BUT FORGETS TO MENTION that RFID can be tracked wireless every time everywhere, while your credit card can only be tracker where YOU CHOOSE TO USE IT.  Concidering the recent issues of RFID read/copy/forgery with even latest "high security passports" (like the ones used in EU), this book is really a HUGE thumbsdown. Dont buy it 
 I was looking forward to another Oprah magazine with great joy.  Unfortunately, the pomp and circumstance within "O at Home"'s pages is a real turnoff for me, an average, middle-class American living, as they say in "middle America".  Although I hesitate to say this in print, it's been in my head for ahile now.  I am a faithful 20-year Oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine.    Is it possible that Oprah has not only forgotten her roots, but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in Malibu?  Is it possible that she has forgotten the 90% of us who live somewhere in between?  If this magazine is an indication, then sadly, she has 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 The book is kind of good, but it moves very very slowly ... there are periods when you feel like its not getting anywhere .. the literature is of course very good, but a ver slow boo 
 Canon's 28-135mm with IS (Image Stabilizer) is a far better choice for the money 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 I admit that I have read every single one of Lilian Jackson Braun's "Cat Who" books. I used to relish every single one, but I agree with the other reviewers: Lately the books have been getting lamer and lamer.  I, too, think the books are now being ghost-written by someone else. I think the ghost-writing began about five or six books ago. It's not just that the mystery, never central, is now utterly an afterthought in these books. Nor is it that the resolution relies not on accute detective work on the part of Qwilleran or KoKo, but on deus ex machina. (Qwill and KoKo used to really sniff around, so to speak.) Nor is it that the style is mucher coyer than what Ms. Jackson Braun used to use. (I've had it with the endless references to the salt-and-pepper mustache already! It's getting to be a parody of itself!) No, the clincher is the many errors and inconsistencies in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey."   Someone has already pointed out that the Siamese take a car trip in perfect harmony in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey." We all remember that Yum-Yum howls whenever she's in the car. And what happened to taking KoKo out on the leash? And the last time we were privy to the love life of Gary Pratt, owner of the Black Bear Cafe, he was mourning a dead girlfriend. When did he pick up the wife who plays such a big role in this book?  The ghost writer not only hasn't read all the "Cat Who" books, s/he hasn't even done much research. In the book, Qwilleran wonders how KoKo could know something if he can't read. But the very first book posits that KoKo can read backwards. Remember the title of the very first book in this series? The ghost writer clearly doesn't!  Also, Eddington Smith's great-grandfather or grandfather is described as a pirate. But, in the original story, wasn't he a highwayman, instead?  The change in tone comes in the very first sentence when there's a quote from the "Qwill Pen": "A town without a bookstore is like a chicken with one leg." Now, the "Qwill Pen," while not exactly Art Buchwald, has never been this ridiculous.  I've been a faithful reader until now, but this book is the last straw. I suspect that there's not one ghost writer, but more than one, and that's why the books aren't just inconsistent with the real "Cat Who" books, but they don't really match each other, either. I hate to say it, but I'm finished with this series 
 The plot was interesting, but less complicated than I expected it would be based on other reviews, and the "surprise" killer was evident from the beginning. The story is gruesome, but not as terrifying as it could be, and not shocking considering what else is available in prose and reality now. The writing was choppy and pedestrian, reminiscent of a high school short story with certain words replaced by "thesaurus alternatives." In such a common joe book, why use "masticated" instead of "eaten"? The book is written as a screenplay and would make a better movie than a novel. Also, the author continually quotes T.S. Eliot without explanation of why the character has these complex, provocative thoughts and only names Eliot as the author of the phrases in an author's note at the back of the book. Elsewhere in the book he uses "Only that and nothing more" as his own words, almost word for word the well known writing of Edgar Allen Poe ("Only this, and nothing more."-The Raven ) Recently another author's work was pulled from the shelves for using such similarities of "internalized" work. Not worth the time, read a spoiler if you want to hear the story. It only took me a few hours to burn through the book given its low level and I wasn't terrified, thrilled or surprised 
 I totally agree with Barry Smith. This book spends more space describing the author's personal use of Lightroom than explaining how to use it. I found  the User Guide both easier to read and more useful than Evening's book. One of the least useful books in the digital imaging field that I have read 
 I have read most of Ludlum's novels, and I usually can't put them down. I found that I was so distracted by the need to correct his grammar, usage, and spelling that I almost didn't finish the book. The story was not bad,  but too contrived even for Ludlum, and not nearly as polished or compelling  as his later novels. Also, of his dialogue was downright embarrassing in  its naive lack of credible inter-sex conversation. Very disappointing for  Ludlum

 I've found two pretty decent uses for Monster Manual IV:  1) If you want to use the Spawn of Tiamat in your game, this book is essential.  2) If you want to assign class levels or subtypes to common monsters from the first Monster Manual, but are short on time, then this book has them ready for you.  A major chunk of this book is devoted to these two things.  The rest contains a decent number of new monsters that may or may not fit into your game.    The new format of this Monster Manual gives every monster at least two pages.  Some of the extra information provided by this format does come in handy, but a lot of it is devoted to discussing how each beast fits into the Forgotten Realms and Eberron campaign settings.  If you don't use either or both of those settings, that's a lot of extra paper you're paying for.  As a point of comparison; if the two page per monster technique was applied to the first Monster Manual, that book would weigh in at around 640 pages (it currently has 320).  I think that's a telling sign of just how much padding this book contains.  If you removed all of its superfluous information, Monster Manual IV could easily be reduced to 112 pages.  Make it a softcover, and you've got a handy $10.95 book on your hands.  As a $34.95 hardcover; however, Monster Manual IV just isn't worth the investment. 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 While "Talk to the Hand" is inescapably mediocre in comparison to "Eats, Shoots & Leaves", a book I found amusing, though not up-to-par to its New York Times Bestseller status, this book does have its moments.   However, I was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of Lynne Truss in presuming to make a comment that, despite whatever way she meant it, ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice. I find it interesting that she, or at least her editors, did not further investigate the disease (which, indeed, gluten tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark.   Oh, yes, bloody well sorry, Ms. Truss, for invading your rude, stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which, I'm sure, someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet. Let's just go and, well, obliterate a genetic disorder! While we're at it, we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. If it pleases and thanks you, Ms. Truss, we celiacs will eat cake. (Oh, bloody hell, did I just say "please"?)  Despite the fact that Lynne Truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, I have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. In explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be quite rude, as well. It is not simply the celiac remark to which I refer: I also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid shouts at his mother, "I want that one, YOU EFFING BITCH!", among others, a bit offensive.  As a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness, I was often thoroughly appalled by this book. No, my friends and I don't usually hold doors for each other, but, in general, I thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. Frankly, I find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. I can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them.  I have to argue that we are not a select group. In today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. Ms. Truss, I believe, would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to be. If she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior.  My last complaint is this: "gluten crap"? You would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as Lynne Truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year, am-I-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word "crap. 
 You would think things would be a paradise in S. Africa if you listened to the Danny Glovers and other Black racists in the world.   So, why is S. Africa degenerating even with all the outpouring of money and business given to them once they became Politically Correct?   Hmmmm.   Mandela was a terrorist.   He could have been a free man if only he renounced violence and he choose not to - what does that tell you?   Look at the pictures of the Church Street bombings which he signed off for.   What a whitewash of History.   Disgusting 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 While the pictures are plentiful, they are a bit boring.  Below average even.  You should exit stage left before paying $ for this book 
 Minotaur initally grabbed my attention. The movie was set in a remote village, and the characters, setting and acting had me hooked. I really liked the film until the youths were taken away to be sacrificed.   Once at the "evil kingdom" and by the minotaur pit, the movie fell apart. The movie became cheesey, with near endless scenes of the evil bad guy sniffing gas from a skull. Yawn. Enough already. Bad acting. Over acting. No care for the characters. Etc.  I thought this movie had a lot of potential with the setting and theme, but sadly it flopped. I've seen worse movies, but that doesn't mean I would recommend Minotaur. If you are looking for something off the shelf that you haven't heard of, but that is good sci-fi, try the Triangle, Firefly or Serenity.  The Scifi has put out many, many quality movies, but sadly this is not one of them. One more comment: one reviewer compared Minotaur to Aliens. That is like comparing the Godfather to Ishtar, Gigli, Battlefield Earth, or Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I encourage you to watch both and judge for yourself.   Total Score (out of 100) = 21  10 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 3 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 4 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase 
 I would recommendthis book for anyone teaching a coarse in web site development or any one making a web site. I have made 3 web sites and they would have been better if I had read this book 
 This book is very hard to understand.  It seems as though one has to have a little bit of a background in psychology (or at least an understanding of it) to undertand the nomenclature of the book and to understand what is being comunicated.  For the previously mentioned reasons I did not like the book.  I expected it to be reader friendly and very practical(to suggest tips in one's life he/she could actually practice- put to use).  It is not. 
 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 Beware! This book has an attractive title for design researchers. I expected it to be a manual that might be useful, for example, to PhD students in design. But it is not. It is hugely disappointing. It has usurped the title `design research' for what is largely innovation management prattle. It's a book for designers, not students. But I'm not sure what designers would get from it. Inspiration to engage more in user research? Perhaps. Encouragement to delve deeper into research methods, and to learn more? No; because the references and further reading are extremely limited. For instance, two potentially useful chapters, overviews of quantitative and qualitative methods respectively, have just one reference between them, and that's to Cooper's The Inmates are Running the Asylum, in the qualitative methods chapter 
 I have not even read the book as of yet. I have just skimmed over reviews written by some of the readers. I understand that this can be an emotional subject for many different reasons. If you come a background in which your anscestors had not been enslaved or lynched or gassed, you may not get why some readers become emotional with this subject matter. I do have a fact based on what I was told from the horse's mouth. Egyptians do consider themselves to be black. I lived in Turkey in 2000 and on my flight back to the U.S., I was waiting in the terminal at the airport in Izmir. This woman kept staring at me. I assumed it was becasue I was the only black woman around and I had grown accustomed to the interest I drew while living in Turkey because it was sincere and genuine. Anyway, she finally approached me and said, "My brother and my nephew and I do not mean to seem impolite, but we are just so happy when we see a brother or sister," I asked what she meant and she said, "Oh, we are black like you, our mother is Egyptian and our father is Turkish, we are black, like you". I noticed their complexions were darker than mine and their was of the same grade as mine. It never occurred to me that they were "black". I noticed that they took such pride in being recognized as such. It really all comes down to what an individual feels he or she identifies most with and what they were taught to believe and whether or not they were taught the truth

  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I had to return this boombox as soon as I opened it because the CD player didn't work.  I got the new one in a few days and it worked for 3 days, then stopped.  It is heavy and cheap and not at all user friendly.  I have never purchased a product online that was such a huge waste of time and money.  I realize that it is an inexpensive, low-end item. Even so, it didn't even meet minimum expectations

 After seeing Jon Kabat-Zinn on McLaughlin's One-on-One I was intrigued and decided to buy this book.  I was sorely disappointed. He makes some good observations (e.g. about ADD and the 24/7 lifestyle), but offers solutions based only on far-eastern philosophies (yoga, meditation, etc).  Not what I expected.  I would not recommend this book to devout Christians or Muslims.  Better stick with the Bible or the Koran, or the writings of accomplished Biblical or Koranic scholars 
 these are pre-canned radio shows with the ever unbearable alexis korner talking on top of the songs as wow cool groovy DJ "intro". the old Radio One was a real live in studio show that was GREAT. THese are mostly studio released cuts from the first and second album mixed with DJ chatter and one HEndrix interview with a phoney, well let's hear that song now shall we intro to the recorded album version!  As one who has been seriously burned by repackaged Hendrix stuff in the past, and as a loong time fan (I remember when he lived and died) it takes alot for me NOT to recommend all things Hendrix, but I cannot recommend this. Find the actual LIVE RAdio One recording, not these packaged cut and pasted radio shows  
 I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on.   Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway

 This book is a poor exposition of a poor theory. The idea of a viral analogue for ideas spreading is not that profound (it's a kind of lightweight analogy that fails to identify the nature of the host, the nature of the contagion, the nature of the conversion etc). If you want to read the best account of the standard Meme theory, then read Dawkin's Selfish Gene.   However, rather than that you might want to go back to a genuine mathematical epidemic model for the spread of beliefs. This was put forward by Goffman et in 1967-71 in a series of papers in Nature and other journals, analysing the spread of symbolic logic through Europe in the 19th century - these are very interesting to read in and of themselves, but also show why the Meme theory is insufficient in and of itself.

 I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point.  Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me.  The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites.  As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring.  Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me 
 I am a beginner at stumpwork and fancy stitches but not at ribbon embroidery or ribbon flowers. I wanted a book with more than just ribbon embroidery so I bought this one. To my disappointment, the instructions consist of pictures of different stitches with no explanations. And then later in the book some basic instructions on how to do those stitches in little projects. So ok, I'm supposed to look at the pictures in the beginning of the book and figure out how to do those stitches without any written instructions (some are very easy, but several of the hard ones left me stumped and very frustrated.) And if I only have pictures to work with then how about enough pictures so I can see which step comes first! How about some lessons in technique! So then after the stitches part now you do the projects except well those are hard to figure out too because of the bare minimum instructions given or none at all. Like where it says: Covering a bead with thread.  Yep that's it just look at the picture and figure it out. Ok so what's the technique? Do I wrap the string around and around through the hole until the bead is completely covered? Or through the hole and then diagonal? And how is it finished off when you've covered the bead? And how is it attached to your project? What is the best technique? Well I still don't know because there are no instructions. That's just a small example of how annoying this book is. So if I want to do a lot of the things in this book then I'll need to buy another book to explain how to figure out this book. So It's not for beginners because it's too confusing but I know it's also not for experts because this stuff is too basic. Yes well needless to say this book is going back to where it came from.  I need an aspirin for this seventeen dollar headache.. 
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 I really wanted to love this book.  I loved the author's autobiography (RED AZELEA) and her novel (KATHERINE)about a foreign English teacher in China, so I expected EMPRESS ORCHID to bring together her amazing talent for prose narrative in English, enhanced with her first-hand research of Chinese sources, to bring to life the mis-judged history of Empress Dowager Tz'u Hsi.   I anticipated some embellishments, but the total re-creation of Tzu Hsi as "Orchid", into a kind of modern woman-warrior, was too much for me.  To ask the reader to believe that an uneducated female was able to "pick up" enough formal literary Chinese to be able to read court documents is stretching history way too far.  Wouldn't it have made a more fascinating story to construe how Orchid was able to hold onto power so long in spite of being illiterate?    The first third of the book is a masterful depiction of the sights, smells, sounds, social structure, of late 19th Century China, and would have gained 5 stars, but the rest devolved into conjecture after conjecture which mix like sour notes in an otherwise brilliant composition. It's a novel, but it's not a historical novel.  Moreover, I $en$ed that the whole $tory was being pitched to the $maller mind$ of Hollywood in hope of a movie deal.  I felt like the author let down her loyal fans while trying to ride her own popularity to chase the $$.  The best part of Empress Orchid is the list of 5 tone-setting quotations from other sources in the facing page prior to the map (unnumbered pages). One of these quotes is from Sterling Seagrave from his book DRAGON LADY: THE LIFE AND LEGEND OF THE LAST EMPRESS OF CHINA, which refers to the fact that in 1974 most of the previously trusted scholarship on Tzu Hsi had been revealed as counterfeit.  This led me to buy Seagrave's book, which explores the falsehoods of these earlier works, and turns into a fluid and fascinating narrative that is truly Biographical History.  In short, you can choose to spend your precious time on 336 pages of a fictional romance novel (Empress Orchid), or 463 pages of intelligent, delicious historical biography (followed by 135 pages of fascinating notes and complete index).  As a student of Chinese language, literature, and history, I recommend reading Seagrave's book first.    
 Lee Eisenberg's "The Number" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted.  Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's "Personal Finance for Dummies", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person.  
 This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!! 
 After two albums of wholly instrumental music, Joe Satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing.  "Flying in a Blue Dream" is the only Satriani record with several (six) vocal cuts.  So how are they?  Well, Satch's voice isn't superb, but he does an ok job.  The problem really is with the material-- it's clear he'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features.  The only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues "Big Bad Moon"-- the piece is blazing and explosive, the vocal is passable, and Satriani is on fire.  But pieces like "Ride", "The Phone Call" and "Strange" are all pretty much forgettable (well, "Ride" is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable...).  The remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory (and primarily acoustic) pieces ("The Feeling") which are nice but largley filler and "Surfing With the Alien" styled instrumentals ("One Big Rush", "Back to Shalla-Bal").  The exception is the chugging opener and title track, "Flying in a Blue Dream", which features Satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist.  Invariably, the album is a bit too weak for its own good-- it's probably also a bit too long (about 65 minutes) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit.  Start with "Surfing With the Alien", come back to this if you want more of the same 
 I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that 
 I was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue). I plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs. One last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me 
 I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out 
 how Irishman Harris could have so gloriously portrayed Cromwell, who initiated the total destruction of the Irish nation, people, language, religion and culture is beyond comprehension, unless he purposefully portrayed him over the top in a guerrilla effort to sabotage this hero-making of a vile and brutal dictator.  Harris later made repentance to his IRish heritage in The Field, a far more interesting film.   
 The acclaim that has greeted this perfectly ordinary book is puzzling, as there is nothing terribly fresh or insightful in it.  Empson, Mahood, Vickers, Joseph and even Hussey are all more rewarding 
 I bought this book, desperate for some practical ideas on how to reclaim my home which has been taken over by three small children...the book is full cheerleader-fluff...offers little or no practical ideas...she even suggested hiring a professional organizer...hello...I can't afford a professional organizer which is why I bought the book. I think this book is basically a self-promotion so people will go to her website 
 but this still would not make up for the disarray this book is in.  The author has a lot of interesting information, but "Tomorrow's Energy" (TE) is very poorly compiled and editted, making it very difficult to read or skim through. I have another book I would recommend in place of this one, but I will hold off until the end of this review because TE should be fully addressed.  There is almost no foresight in this book. TE reads almost like hydrogen is just a fuel of the past when in fact many of us hope and expect it will one day be our fuel of choice. Even in the last chapter, "The Next 100 Years," the author just continues quoting away and giving speculation by others instead of reflecting on where hydrogen is going to go from his expertise (his perspective would have been nice since he has obviously done a lot of research on the topic).  The book reads like a collection of essays by the author on historical bits about hydrogen. Instead of telling us who did what on what date and here is what the person who did it had to say, it would have been far more useful to have the author explain in his own words what is going on and break the book into smaller sections if necessary (which really is necessary since there are so many random discussions it is painful).  Also, as "Slezak" mentioned, the units (GJ, BTU's, calories, you name it, it's in here) are flip-flopped throughout the book, making it incredibly difficult to follow the numbers, which is really relavent information to this topic.  The only type of person who will find TE useful over the book below is someone who wants to know a lot of details about the history of hydrogen and less about whether it will be useful for us in the future.  Now, my recommendation...  "The Hype about Hydrogen" (THAH), by Joseph Romm  THAH is still a little dry, but it does magnitudes better than TE, and it is consistent with units and has pretty clear descriptions. I couldn't put THAH down (I finished it in less than 2 days*), but after getting into TE about 100 pages, I dreaded going back to it. I made myself finish TE because I looked forward to what I expected to be the forward thinking last chapter (which, as mentioned above, was a great disappointment). *I'm a diligent (slow) reader 
 At a time when the baby boomer's were yet to exist, WW2 was happening. A school of boys are stranded on an island due to a plane crash with no adult anywhere. The leader Ralph created 2 teams to survive each having a certain task. Jack becomes the hunter team, while Ralph was more of the society creation team. Ralph's second had man, Piggy, helps out in more than a few ways untill tradgity strikes. The teams divide as the socity clapes and roles are broken. WIlliam Golding has created another timeless piece, full of changes and plot twists in "lord of the Flies" 
 It is bad enough that this is a poor book with no balance, but to require it as a text in post-graduate studies in education almost brings on apoplexy.  It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education.  It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues.  The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions.  The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that "society" is essentially American culture with its own priorities.  They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well.  The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity.  The book is unbearable in its "holier than thou" attitude.  I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of vie 
 I learn much more from watching the two great masters in TV than reading their cook books. I was really looking forward to receive these 4-disc DVDs.  Unfortunately when the package arrived, two of the discs were not secured inside the box and there were deep scratches on the surface of the discs.  I returned the set and asked for a replacement.  The second package arrived with the same problem.  A La Carte, the distribution, could have come up with a better packaging than cramping 4 discs inside a single box.  I decided to keep the merchandize because I really treasure this TV series.  But if you are not as crazy as I am, don't buy this set until the distributor comes up with a better package 
                  As you can tell by the header, I was disappointed by this movie. Since Kurt Russell plays the lead, I should not have been surprised, because the parts he plays are generally rather predictable and simplistic (Tango & Cash, Snake Plisskin, etc). I just don't picture Kurt as lead actor in a gritty, realistic drama...but, eternally the optimist, I hoped that this might be the exception. It wasn't.  The story involves two LA detectives, one a grizzled and thoroughly corrupt veteran (Russell) and the other a somewhat principled but weak-willed and easily manipulated rookie, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman). Russell's character (Eldon Perry) is controlled and protected by an exceedingly corrupt superior officer, Jack Van Meter (nicely played by Brendan Gleeson), who uses Perry to further his profitable and flagrantly illegal interests.   If you have ever watched "The Shield" on FX cable network then you will be familiar with this general setup....a morally ambiguous detective is used to further his superior's agenda.....but here is the problem: The Shield (a television series) is vastly superior in every way: plot, acting, characterization, dialog, direction, etc. to this feature film. It is like comparing filet mignon to cheap hamburger. Once you see a quality, nuanced drama like The Shield, this movie and all like it are rendered unwatchable.   Characters in Dark Blue are caricatures with almost no depth. They guzzle whiskey and laugh about their flagrant crimes. The plot and dialog are contrived and unrealistic. There is no subtlety....no intellectually stimulating complexity. Eldon always does exactly as he is told: if mass-murdering thugs (employed and protected by his superior) are to be sheltered from arrest, simply go out and murder a couple of stray ex-cons and let them take the rap (posthumously) for the real criminals. Never mind that neither of the ex-cons is even close to being a plausible suspect. No one would be fooled by this ruse, except perhaps in this mindless movie.   Eldon gets his partner Keough to perform one of the cold-blooded murders ordered by Van Meter, and thus begins their downfall, because Keough has a spontaneous change of heart and suddenly cannot accept the guilt of his actions. One minute he is guzzling whiskey with his cronies and laughing about lying to a shooting review board, and the next he is overwrought with guilt. Not at all likely in real life, but it suits the plot.   Things gets even sillier when the partner (Speedman) then teams up with the assistant chief's (Ving Rhames) predictably beautiful ex-mistress (Michael Michelle) to try to arrest the real thugs and use them to bring down the whole perverted mess. Heaven forbid that he simply come forth and provide evidence to accomplish this end. What follows is a lengthy, confused, and poorly choreographed pursuit of the thugs and a predictable gun battle with equally predictable outcome.   The ultimate farce, however, is reserved for Eldon himself, who drives around South Central Los Angeles during the peak of the Rodney King riots trying to find and arrest a black suspect....which he easily accomplishes....and then drives away without a scratch. This reaches the level of surrealistic absurdity and is an insult to the true horror of the riots.  Equally unconvincing is Eldon's spontaneous change of heart at the end of the movie, during his promotion ceremony (such irony), when he delivers a rambling, preposterous and unconvincing indictment of his father, himself, and his evil superior....which is simplistically and immediately accepted (in true movie fashion) by all who hear it, and who then immediately jump to arrest and condemn the naughty superior. This is silly, implausible, and an insult to any viewer above the age (and maturity) of a 10-year old. Jump up at your next promotion ceremony and deliver a rambling condemnation of your superior and see what happens. This type of naive nonsense occurs in only one place: the movies....bad ones.   If you were thrilled by Tango & Cash, and thought Snake Plissken was a brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero, then by all means hit the "Buy It Now" button for this DVD. But, if you want complexity, subtlety, realism, plausibility, and infinitely superior acting, plot, characterization, and direction....do yourself a huge favor and use your money to either subscribe to FX on cable, or buy/rent DVD's of The Shield series....filet mignon is always better than cheap hamburger 
 I've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on DVD and was so disappointed to discover it's only available in a full-screen format. For those who don't know the difference, this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format, so to make it fit the traditional square television, they had to crop out a lot of the picture. What's more, this "restored" version contains no documentaries--only trailers and cast lists. I e-mailed Sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time. What a shame! The film was released on VHS in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the DVD release. If you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release, don't buy this chopped-up version. Save your money and watch the VHS or widescreen airings on Turner Classic Movies. Eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better DVD 
 Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others.  I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues.  I'd recommend skipping this one 
 Most of the reviews here simply don't give you the correct concept of this thing, and i have read them all.  As a piece of hardware, it's fine. The note paper is 6" x 9." I haven't tried to find that yet, so i can't speak to the complainers, but I think i should be able to find it, and if i can't, i will go to kinkos or somewhere and have them cut me a pile of pads.  that being said, i will probably NEVER need another pad because the software with this bad boy is so horrible, it's nearly indescribable.  What were they thinking? I know: they were thinking this: "We Taiwanese guys know how this stuff should REALLY work. We don't care how EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD WORKS, we have BETTER IDEAS."  And so, let me tell you, that you absolutely CANNOT upload files from your tablet in any comprehensible way. Each page is a file, but that DOES NOT MEAN you can simply upload them and work with them.  A camera, a memory stick: these just plug into your usb port or hub, and WORK. This gizmo DOESN'T. It plugs in, gets detected, but looks like an EMPTY CD/DVD DRIVE. You click on the device, and it ASKS YOU TO LOAD A DISK.  When you try to use the outlandish software provided - even after downloading the latest and greatest - the "import function" WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT FIND YOUR STUFF.  In short, this software is so bad that it makes the device pretty much useless. Run away from this thing which looks inviting but wastes so much of your time that you will go way out of your way to warn others, and write about it on Amazon.com.  Why two stars? I'm holding out 1 star for the next version. 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 While some of the evidence could be considered compeling if properly presented, it holds little water in the "I Hate Clinton" context.  I am sure Cashill learned more about evidence while earning his Phd at Purdue.  Apparently WND has focused the fear mongering and hate side of Cashill and blinded him to "good" research.  His recent book "hoodwinked" though outs his haterd for academia, so maybe he did not learn much in West Lafayette, just honed his dislikes.  But this wonderful (puke, gag) piece of work has found its place into Amazon's top 20,000..............  woooohooooo, go jack.  You should check out his doctorile thesis on capitalism and fictional heros, another steller work............  you go jack, jack for dog catcher.............  maybe he can round up farah, coulter, "oxycontin" rash and oreally, agents of the dark side.......  the anti-truth tellers.... 
  What started out as a great story finished as an agit-prop piece for PETA. The preaching was so banal that I was rooting for the bad guys at the end. Only things missing were the white hats and the black hats so we poor readers wouldn't be confused. Borrow it from the library if you must, but don't waste money on a purchase 
 This book was a required text, otherwise I never would have read it.  The book is full of inconstancies, bad literary technique, and it takes to many pages to cover not enough material.  The authors personal prejudices are obvious.  There are better books on teamwork available 
 Micheal Dell comes off as a self promoting marketing blow hard and it is not worth the read.  [... 
 As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia 
 Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this 
 LOOK, ANYTIME AN AUTHOR TEAMS UP WITH ANOTHER ONE ( whom i don't know ) TO WRITE A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST WARNING . MY EXCUSE THEN ?  WELL, I WAS IN A HOTEL ON VACATION, COULDN'T SLEEP ...AND THIS  PULP FICTION WAS THE LESSER OF THE EVILS IN THE GIFTY-GIFT SHOP WHERE I PAID FULL PRICE.  I SUSPECT I MAY EVEN HAD PAID CANADIAN PRICES EVEN THO I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C.   LOL...THE JOKE IS ON ME .  BUT, PER USUAL I SHALL DONATE THIS  HARDLY BENT BOOK TO EITHER MY LIBRRAY,  OR IF THEY REFUSE TO TOUCH IT ...A PRISON WHERE THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN. I GAVE IT TWO STARS FOR CORRECT SPELLING ....LOL.  I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH INSOMNIA  
 With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.  What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.  Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' "Looking at America" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.  Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just "played it safe".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!  Grade: ** out of **** 
 I truly disliked this biography, I thought it was poorly written & researched, melodramatic and frankly dull, given its subject matter.  I struggled to finish it.  Better books for insight into Alexandra are:  "Purple Secret" by John Rohl, et al. for its chapter on Alexandra's complex medical history; Robert Massie's "Nicholas & Alexandra" for its sympathetic understanding of Alix's traumatic childhood loss of her mother, and what it's like to be the parent of a hemophaelic (& despite Massie's inaccuracies, such as stating that Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of the marriage of Nicky & Alix & that she tried to talk Alix into it, when in fact she dreaded it), and, oddly enough, a biography of Alix's mother, "Princess Alice" by Gerard Noel, which gives excellent insight into Alix's parents and German background.  Also, "Advice to My Granddaughter" a collection of letters between Queen Victoria and Alix's oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Battenberg.  There is also "A Lifelong Passion", a collection of letters & diaries of Nicholas & Alexandra and the people around them. Any one of these has more value than Erickson's book.  I have not read Greg King's biography of Alexandra so cannot comment on it.  I've enjoyed Erickson's Tudor biographies, so I'm trying to be fair, but this one didn't cut it 
 The lead actors in this movie (Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger)were pretty flat and unconvincing, namely in the lines where they are trying to sound empathetic and concerned. The paper mache cow he was beating seemed pretty unconvincing, too. The movie is, simply enough, about a dual-personality character who has conflict with himself, and that's the most of it. More could have been done with it. More, and better 
 An interesting discussion of differing approaches by the medical and non-medical communities. The techniques espoused by Mr. Sarno didn't help my back pain, though 
 Strawson's work reigned as the supreme example of Kant scholarship in English for several decades.  It might have been ok for its time, but it offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant, and attempts to separate the contents of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic from his Transcendental Analytic, arguing that only the contents of the latter have merit.  But the two sections play the similar roles in Kant's revolution and to wholly reject the aesthetic and not the analytic is, I believe, impossible.  Strawson does not even take seriously the arguments of Kant's aesthetic, probably because he is English and the English always get nervous around the aesthetic.  While one may still have to deal with this book if writing a paper on Kant, as Strawson is still held in fairly high regard, I would recommend this book only for one who is not familiar with the traditional idealist interpretations of Kant 
 If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development".  Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans.  Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves".  A movie for history's circular file 
 i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars 
 I don't know what everyone loves about this book?! Yeah, I thought the title was funny, but boy was I wrong about its contents! As an expectant father who has read quite a few books meant specifically for fathers, I was expecting a bit more from this one. What I came to find out was that unfortunately, the title of this book is its only redeeming feature.  This book is neither informational nor funny. Its brevity in actually providing useful information was appalling. Do they think we are Neanderthals who aren't interested in having a positive and interactive child birth experience with our wives? Beyond this, the book is completely chauvinistic towards women in every way possible. It does not teach men to enjoy and learn with their partners during the pregnancy, it tells them how to "deal" with their hormonal wives and ways to avoid getting themselves involved.  After reading this book, I was actually offended to think that anyone would consider men in this light. As a man who is interested in his wife and in learning about his yet unborn child, this all too common outlook about men and pregnancy is exactly what we do not need on our bookshelves.  Forget this book altogether and check out one that will actually be funny, informative, and teach you a thing or two! My favorite book is one in the series by Armin Brott. He is a great writer with lots of great resources and insight into what it is to be an expecting father. Try starting with The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips and Advice for Dads-To-Be. You will not be disappointed 
 For some reason the product was not delivered, UPS returned it.  This was send for charity.  After many emails and phone calls, the company refuses to respond or refund the money. SHipping was more than the product 
 I have never heard so much awful sound come out of something so small. These were simply the worst speakers ever. They are scratchy and tinny and you have to turn the volume all the way up and that makes them hiss and buzz. I hope they were defective-- thats what I said when I returned them-- because I can't believe any company would sell something that was this terrible. Oh and the silver-- it is just a bit of paint on the front. The speakers are actually white. 
 A very slow-moving, frustrating reading experience.  I couldn't get into it and didn't finish it.  Ended by skipping around, trying to get re-interested.  What some people mean by "poetic" is what others would call aimless, a device to avoid actually having to interpret anything.  Instead, the author gives snapshot histories.  Some people call that "postmodern" instead of lazy or not very well done.  Not my taste, although apparently others liked it well enough 
 After reading probably 95% of the Star Wars adult novels in existence, I would have to say that this one is the worst Star Wars novels to date that I have read. The only one that surpasses it is Jedi Trial (and The Black Fleet Crisis is in the running in case you were wondering). To give you an idea of how bad this is, I will number each point (in no particular order). 1. I feel that, in general, the author threw information about the characters at you--such as how scary or courageous or dangerous these people are supposed to be (their actions never justify such a narration, however)--and expects you to believe it.  No actions are used to actually prove the author's claims.  For instance, the rulers are supposed to be so brave, but they certainly never give me the impression they actually are. 2. The 'love' story between Nate and Sheeka is so stupid and corny I just wanted to laugh (it is obvious when reading how Sheeka talks that a man wrote this novel). The author forces the chemistry between the two and doesn't spend enough time to cement their relationship. I still wonder how Sheeka got pregnant--the auther never even hints at any intimacy (other than a kiss) between the two (I would like a hint of their intimacy, not a full-blown steamy sex scene). 3. Kit Fisto, whom I had hoped to learn more about, drifts into the background and is so unimportant (fades behind Nate), I wonder why Steve even bothered to include him in here.  This point is probably the most annoying point in the book besides, maybe the next... 4. Asajj Ventress was NOT scary in the least. All she did was boast about how she would kill Obi-Wan and how much smarter she was than anybody else. Oh...I forgot! She also stalked Obi-Wan (real scary, huh?). I had so hoped, after seeing her in the Clone Wars animated shorts, that the author would use her to her fullest. I was wrong. 5. The battle sequences were too short. Typically I get tired of long battle sequences and wish the author would cut some material out but not this time. The author glosses over the lightsaber battles as if they are just fillers.  I want to know some of the dynamics, not a blow-by-blow and not a summary either. 6. I can't believe that Obi-Wan (who seems to be a big whiny know-it-all in this book--I half expect to see a line similary to the infamous 'I want to go to Toshee Station to pick up some power converters') would stoop to deception to trick the Cestians to turning to the Republic.  It just seems out of character to me.  Obi-Wan is very traditional, by-the-book.  Qui-Gon (and maybe Anakin) would stoop to deception; not Obi-Wan. 7. The story's ending was way too pat. It's like all of a sudden--boom! 8. Snoil, the Snail. I mean, come on! Are you that desperate for a new species?  Why can't authors reuse at least one alien from another book? There were a few bright points in the book: the aliens were cool, and I also liked how the author showed the point of view of a clone bred for war (but Karen Traviss does a much better job in Hard Contact). Also, the author writes a superb short story inclueded in the paperback version (I don't know why the short story was better than the novel but it was). But, overall, I would not recommend buying this book (unless in paperback or used or free) unless you are like me and trying to read all the Star Wars books. I would suggest that you check it out at the library or skip it.  You won't miss any important developments.  Recommended Reads: Jedi Apprentice Series, Thrawn Trilogy (absolute BEST!), some of the New Jedi Order (most notably Traitor), Shatterpoint, the MedStar duology (ER, anyone?), Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, Revenge of the Sith novelization, anything by Timothy Zah 
 Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit 
 I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.  In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund 
 Reading this book you feel embarrassed for Margaret Carlson. She brags about being a member of the Sally Queen Special Class in Washington. She shows contempt for ordinary people and their concerns. She hated Al Gore because he talked about issues on the campaign plane, issues that effect the lives of millions. She liked Bush because he served lobster ravioli on the campaign plane and made funny faces instead of boring her with discussion of issues. She recycles her columns from Time magazine. No original insights in her columns. Just conventional wisdom. No wonder Time magazine cancelled her column 
 Be aware that this book was labeled as 'trash' by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper claiming the author destorts his facts.  The book supports and suggests a chain of clinics called 'HealthMed', which are run by Scientologists.  Make up your own mind 
 I think I understand what Camp is.  "The Damned" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time.  I guess Gay folks everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the "great" director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb.  Mel Brooks realized in his film "The Producers" that Nazi's are damn funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed swirls about.  The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst.  The young blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're lined up against the wall.  Rome may have had Caligula, but The Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings.  I watched the whole thing and I'm going to end this review to take a shower 
 If you're looking for a book on technique, which I was, RUN AWAY!  This book is about the philosophy of making pots.  I found the title misleading; I expected something more concrete (no pun intented).  This is a cerebral book; it has its place, and I may learn to love it, but not today.  Today I'm just disappointed 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 This book is chock full of hatred and inaccuracies. I was forced to read this book for a class and was disgusted from page one. How a teacher can assign this horror for a diversity class is beyond me. If you want indoctrination, then by all means read this nonsense. 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!

 Amos Oz, is in my judgment, one of the greatest contemporary writers. His memoir " A Tale of Love and Darkness" is a  literary classic of tremendous power. However Oz is also a 'political prophet'. And often holds forth in a way as if to suggest he feels himself taking upon himself the mantle of his Biblical namesake. Here he should perhaps have been a bit more cautious and remembered the Jewish teaching that in our time 'prophecy' is given to 'children' and ' fools'. In this small gathering of small works Oz reiterates his well- known analysis of the Israeli- Arab conflict. It is as he understands it a 'dispute over land' between two peoples each of whom has a legitimate claim. The fanatics on one side( A fanatic in Oz's term is one for whom every means even the most bloody justifies the end) are those who say ' all is mine, and nothing is the others'. The reasonable people of which Oz is as he understands it preeminently one( though he makes it clear he too was raised as a little fanatic in pre- Jewish state 'Palestine') understand that there has to be a painful, reasonable compromise. The end of fanaticism is as he understands it the end of the Arab- Israeli conflict. A divided Holy Land, two states, one predominantly Jewish, and one Arab.  This analysis is of course not simply Oz's but has been the analysis of the moderate left in Israel, a good share of Western European Governments, and successive U.S. administrations.It now is the 'dream' of the vast majority of Israelis. It is on the basis of this analysis that US diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East has been conducted for more than half - a - century.  The problem however is that the analysis is drawn along too broad, too symmetrical and at the same time too limited lines. It is not right to say that the conflict is 'primarily' about land. Such a position was more credible three decades ago, but today given the rise of a worldwide pan-Islamic movement , it  misses the mark.  The truth is that what Oz calls 'fanatics' are the great majority on the Islamic Palestinian side. ( He denies this, but the recent 'Hamas' victory in the Palestinian elections suggests he is once again ' sweeting' Palestinian positions) . The fact is that there is no symmetry between the ' fanaticism' of the Islamic world and the alleged 'fanaticism' of the Jews even those Oz calls ' settlers'. There is no Jewish Literature no settler Literature calling for the extermination of Palestinians, as there is daily Palestinian and Arab propaganda calling for the murder and elimination of Jews.There has never been deliberate Israeli effort at murdering Palestinian civilians, while murdering of Israeli civilians is a generally accepted Palestinian tactic.  Oz misleads and presents a false picture in harping on an alleged an unreal symmetry between Israelis and Palestinians. One question of course is why he would want to do this? One answer is very simply that the kind of answer he gives makes a reasonable solution possible. Another answer is that it of course puts him above , makes him the good guy with the Europeans the Americans the Nobel Prize Committee , everyone else who would like to see the conflict resolved in this way.  Perhaps what I have just said is unfair, though Oz's tendency to preach his own views becomes increasingly irritating as they diverge with the years from the 'reality on the ground'. Had Oz' had a bit more honesty he would have given up certain familiar 'socialist egalitarian 'mantras of his  youth- and understood that there is a tremendous assymetry between the Jewish Israeli position and the Islamic Palestinian one. He would have had the honesty to understand that one very vast civilization, the Islamic, has a set of problems , which are endangering other human beings throughout the world. One such leader of that civilization , a leader who considers himself the great protector of the Palestinians, Mohammed Ahmadinejad has been continually threatening to wipe 'Israel ' from the map.  Perhaps Oz's analysis on ' fanaticism' would have been more convincing had it focused on  Mr.Ahmadinejad and his ilk.  i.e. Willy- nilly whether it likes it or not , Oz's country Israel is involved in the conflict of those who champion freedom and democracy against those Totalitarian- Terrorist- Islamic Regimes which would make the 'Koran' our sole bed-time reading.    
 This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.  If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.     
 This book contains wrong information. The chapter by Razeghi provides scientific erorr, fabraicated  data, incorrect and false statements. I can't believe Dr. Dutta didn't correct things 
 The software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much I had to remove it on 2 and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the thre 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 With Just Rewards, BTB has managed to write the worst book of Woman of Substance series!  Emma's Secret and Unexpected Blessings lacked a certain punch and certainly rewrote the history of the first 3 books.  However, the characters in those 2 books were at least likable.    In this book, Linnet appears to be a unbelievable snob - pretty much turning up her nose at Evan's sisters because they're adopted (People without the noble Harte/Oneil/Kallinski) blood aren't as good as everyone else.  Evan's mother, father, and grandmother love Evan much more than her adopted sisters.  Apparently, Evan's sister was a 'foundling' and has no chance of being as good as a Harte.   Evan is shocked that her father would feel that he is cut out of her life!  However, she allows her 'in-laws' to plan her whole wedding, ends up having a secret ceremony in which she is more concerned that Paula and Shane attend than her own parents.  Paula, who used to be one of the smartest business women in the last 30 years, has all of sudden become one of the dumbest.  In the past, BTB made her heroines a bit too perfect - but at least down to earth.  Now, we're supposed like people that seem to be insensitive snobs.  Also, this certainlly doesn't appear to be the LAST book of the series.. 
 I don't know why, but this album not only does nothing for me, listening to it actually irritates me in that the songs are so bland and long.  I do love "The Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead" and "The Smartest Monkeys" is listenable, but the rest is precious and dull.  XTC is a band I root for because I do feel they should have reeped more benefits from their music career than they have.  Their chance at a hit song was crushed when the bible belt banned their masterpiece, "Dear God", from the radio and they have never released albums that are "current".  I am glad they moved on to the aound of Venus Apple, it is all potential, but hopefully newcomers to XTC's music stay away from this one.  XTC deserves to at least make a living from their brilliant music.  I will keep my fingers crossed that albums like English Settlement, Drums and Wires, The Black SEa, Skylarking, The Big Express will bring new fans and if not they are able to make brilliant music in the future that broadens their audience. 
 Where's the father in this story?  With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad.  If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best.  I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids.  They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly. 
 I have been a Diana Krall fan for years. Have all her albums and play them regularly. I felt however that her heart simply was not in this album. The album lacked energy. Just to be sure, I gave it to another DK afficianado and she agreed with me. I trust that this is a career hiccup and not a trend 
 This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am.  But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, "When's he going to get to the point?"  The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary.  The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor.  Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy.   This was the only part of the book I was interested in.  To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with "fluff".  However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts.  I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd.  I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise 
 I have read nearly all of Philip Roth's works over the last four months, and this very early work is the only book of his that I didn't like at all. There are NO JEWS in the whole book, and Newark is a thousand miles away! Phil, don't be a shmegeggy, come back to the neighborhood! In "The Facts, a Novelist's Autobiography", Roth reveals that Lucy is modeled after his psychotic first wife, who is much more interestingly rendered in "My Life as a Man". For the best of Roth, try "American Pastoral", "Portnoy's Complaint", any of the Zuckerman series, "Operation Shylock", or "The Counterlife". Just a humble opinion from a Roth Fanatic 
  If you want to know the truth about the time and people portrayed in this book try reading Lost Astronaut or one of dozens of other books written by the astronauts and the people closest to them at the time. There are many many excellent books. I have had the pleasure to read most of them. THIS IS A MOVIE at best and a LIE at worst. I hope Tom made lots of money.   
 I tried to read this book, but could not finish it.  The book had an interesting message, but it was lost in the inaccuracies, broad sweeping statements, and linear logic.    His comments about Peak Oil were inaccurate.  There are plenty of books (1,000 Barrels a Second, for example) that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight.      With regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence.  He failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast.  (For the record I am originally from the upper Midwest, but lived in the southeast for 7 years.)  Much of his prognostications about the future are linear, that is if a then b then c.  The author is in his late 50s and I would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment.  If the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars, drive less, close off portions of the house in the winter, don't use the air conditioner, purchase smaller homes, etc.  If the environment changes people constantly adjust including me, the author, and you.  What bothers me most about the book is that young people with less "life-experience" will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be.  The author's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future.  But if life is a dynamic process, the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur 
 when I ordered the book there was no indication that it was a study guide, I wanted a textbook and I received a study guide, the add was very misleading.  
 I like most of Oliver Sacks's books.  I think "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" and "An Anthropologist on Mars" are major contributions to the understanding of the human mind.  I do have a problem with "Migraine" however.  My experience as a migraine sufferer and as a clinical psychologist has left me in no doubt that the fundamental causes of migraine headaches are physical, not psychological.  I have no doubt that stress can make the attacks worse, but I believe most migraines are triggered by such physiological factors as allergies (particularly MSG, chocolates, red wines, and well-cured cheeses), or by overexposure to bright sunlight, too much sugar, or by overexertion or overstimulation with an accompanying lack of rest.  Sacks takes a Freudian view of migraine, which I believe is inaccurate.  I now get migraine attacks perhaps a tenth as often as a few years ago, and the improvement has not been due to psychotherapy or any earthshaking insights, but to my avoiding MSG and chocolate and to my doctor perscribing Imitrex.  Imitrex is a miracle medication for patients who can tolerate it.  (It can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure in some people, hence the need for a doctor's prescription.)  Sacks has written some fine books, but I don't think this one belongs near the top of the list 
 The whole novel should have centralized on Firekeeper's story.  The plot was complicated with ridiculous characters and kingdoms you don't even find out about until three-quarters through the novel.  I kept having to refer back to see how the heck these people were related and who the heck they were.  The beginning of THROUGH WOLF's EYES is wonderful, engrossing,  and exciting.   But once they get to court, you want to dump the book on the nearest coffee table from frustration and boredom. It really, and I mean really, gets nutty talking about a million characters you don't know, can't understand who they are, and don't care a chit about. Get back to the protagonist please!?    The whole war was half-hearted and not compelling at all.  All I cared about as a reader was what was to become of Firekeeper, was the real Lady Blysse really dead, would Holly find out who Firekeeper really is....  and who was Blind Seer really, a royal wolf?  The author NEVER explains that one.   I love dogs of all kinds, I'm 40 years old, and I love good fantasy. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more had I been an eighteen-year old.  It just seemed the promise the book held remained unfulfilled.  When it ended, I just held it going, "huh.".  That's it? 
 I know some might think I'm being an oddball about this, but part of the great thing about the first two seasons of "Happy Days" is . . . the music! Season One was great. The visuals are stunning in their colors and all syndicated scenes are restored. But, Season Two is horrible! I don't know what jackass was in charge of this second season project, but they should be fired and Paramount should scrap it and correct all of their mistakes! The video quality is lame, at best; but the music is pure horror! They stupidly replaced the opening theme of "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley with the stupid "Happy Days" song from the third season.  Also, gone are the music of The Everly Brothers, Fats Domino and the other rock'n'roll classics this show was famous for, and dubbed in with badly-done generic instrumentals! I was so angry after watching the first one and then the episode where Ritchie is a D.J., that I literally yanked the DVD out of the player and threw the entire set across the room! I want these shows looking and SOUNDING just as I remember them in the '70s. The sound quality of the voices are terrible, too! Please, if you're a real "Happy Days" fan, write Paramount and demand they correct all their stupid blunders . . . and DO NOT BUY THIS SET! You will be disappointed 
 I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?  I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.    The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.  
 The Microsoft Wireless Optical Elite has been a less than satisfactory purchase for me.  Although I like the feel of the keyboard, I am still having trouble getting used to the layout, and have found that it is easy to hit the thumbwheel on the left side, causing the screen to scroll unexpectedly.  I've found the placement and layout of the group of buttons to the right of the main keys, and containing the Delete, PageUp and PageDown buttons, to be particularly troublesome: I always seem to be hitting the wrong key, and have sometmes brushed the Delete key while typing, with the usual unhappy results.  The driver is constantly telling me that I have low signal strength, even though the wireless receiver is within 2 inches of the keyboard.  Replacing the batteries has not helped.  I've also found that it tends to skip characters while typing.  The mouse is a bit better: it feels comfortable and works as expected, with no surprises.  All in all, although better than the keyboard on my laptop, this is not a product I can recommend, particularly given the price.  Some of the lower priced wireless Microsoft keyboards used by friends and family seem to work better, and are laid-out better, than this "top of the line" model. 
 A ghastly book by the sadly misnamed Sarah Smiley. I have a weakness for domestic memoirs (Jean Kerr, Shirley Jackson, Erma Bombeck) and I am, myself, a military wife, so I was excited to find this book and fully expected to enjoy it.  I hated it. A lot. With the exception of books about serial killers, I don't believe I've ever read a book with a protagonist I liked less. 260 pages of whining. No empathy for anyone: poor Sarah always has it worse. Her mother (an admiral's wife) comments that deployments used to be worse back in the days before email. No, says Sarah, email is worse because there is more disappointed anticipation. ?!?   A friend suffers a miscarriage and Sarah has to be literally shamed into going to help her (Sarah doesn't like blood, you see). Nowhere in the remainder of the book is there an inkling of sympathy for this woman (also a military wife) who has had three miscarriages, the last one while her husband was deployed. It's all about Sarah (who has to babysit for the woman's older child).  Another friend's husband is sent home from the deployment and their family must relocate to California (from Florida) in a month. The reasons for this are not specified, but I can tell you that an officer isn't usually sent home early from a deployment for good behavior. Sarah's response? First, jealousy that her friend's husband is coming home; second, discontent that she (Sarah) will be losing her friend!  The worst, though, is her treatment of her husband, whom she is mad at throughout the entire book. To use one example only: Sarah's husband sends her an email -- one that would have broken my heart had my husband sent it to me -- in which he writes sadly that he will miss seeing their new baby's first smile, just as he missed seeing their older son's. Sarah's response to this? To be angry because that was the only email he sent her that day.   I finished the book only because I was hoping she would grow up! Nope, though. She was just as self-absorbed and whiney on the last page as she had been on the first. I came to Amazon and read the reviews and found several people who said something like "I don't know anything about the military, but now I have an understanding of what military wives go through." I hate the idea that people will read this tripe and think it is in any way representative of me, or of any of the fine military spouses I have known!  And this was a memoir! I can't imagine writing a book in which I acted like a spoiled brat from page 1 to page 260 and allowing it to be published with my picture on the front! Of course, Sarah doesn't think she is a spoiled brat -- oh no! Sarah pees champagne and poops gold bricks and is the white-hot center of the universe...  Once I finished it I threw the thing in the garbage. Yep, the garbage. Usually I donate books I don't want anymore to the library, but that didn't seem final enough in this case. So it's on its way to the York County Waste Treatment Facility right now. And I'm not a bit sorry! 
 The pages are interesting glimpses of possibilities on "the other side". This is a book of artwork presenting different points of view of an illustration.  The book starts with drawings of how to make a paper airplane.  The next illustration is a little girl practicing a cello and seeing a paper airplane fly past her window.  Turn the page to see the air outside of the apartment building filled with paper airplanes which a little boy has thrown out of the window.  I really enjoyed looking at that idea of "the other side".  It got strange from there as disconnected scenarios trying to be connected are presented.  I couldn't quite figure it all out from front to back; back to front; and middle to outside even with the help of friends.  I concluded that it was just different illustrations. I found myself "on the other side" and I didn't get it. 
 So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an "unusual" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down. 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 I never recieved the book and it was cancelled eventhough I wrote a note to Amazon informing them that my address is in the Virgin Islands and the order was sent to one of the ststes. I was very disappointed 
 I agree with the other post. Great if you have a Nikon flash, but not much  help with other types of lighting solutions. The author needed to get into  more detail other than just flash photography. Also,the writing was hard to  follow and confusing 
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 ...doesn't deserve to be in print. Terry Bisson has to be the absolute worst writer ever to be published. It only took three chapters from "In The Upper Room and Other Likely Stories" for me to determine that TB is completely untalented and probably got most of his ideas about writing from a weekend seminar called "Repetition is Funny or How to Say Things Until They Are Funny". I take that back, TB has one talent, and that is his talent to take a perfectly good premise and completely butcher it with his repetitive, dull and close minded style. I gave him three chances and he blew it three times in a row with the first three stories in this book. All the good ideas got mangled by his inept, sorry excuse for style. He is a one trick pony that is funny only by accident and even then not very. Mostly I found myself feeling sorry for the poor slob. Skip this book. I got it from the library and I am thinking of suing them mental anguish. Yuck yuck yuck... Avoid at all costs 
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos.  Thus this ship was something of a disappointment.  As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it.  The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it.  Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it.  So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details 
 I have had my analon "professional" since 1996, I loved it at first, in fact, I don't even own metal utensils, so I was confident it would never scratch the non-stick finish. Now, 10 years later, I can tell you that all the pans I barely used, are still fine, look good. The pans I used daily (the fry pans) are absolute messes. I cook with egg whites a lot, so I think that having something so hard to get off really had taken a toll on the pans.  At $60 (the current price) I would consider how much you use cookware. I must replace my frypan now and have a "non-coordinated" set. Do your research on non-stick finishes before making the investment.  In all fairness, my favorite pot is the stockpot and I use it many times per week for stews, spaghetti, manwhiches, and it still looks great 
 unimpressive...glad I didn't pay the full $949.00 List Pric 
 So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version.  
 If you don't know much more about Woodrow Wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. There's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. Maybe Woodrow Wilson's life is just too large for a book this small 
 I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat. 
 Standout tracks: EARLY, LAND BREAD&HOUSING, FOR YOU, CONFIDENTIAL(one deep song), 5 ELEMENTS(that beat is crazy!), TOO SMART(another deep song) Filler: Love you cant borrow(neo soul to the core), Gunslinger(garbage showtune record that brings the album down a couple of stars), Been through, Dont put down your flag(dull song even duller beat), The beat etc. Comrades call would have been a standout track if Styles P wasnt rapping offbeat. Bottom line: This is not the best effort M-1 can give you. There is not many gems in the music and it almost feels like a pop album even though its not. Its almost as if M-1 dumbed himself down for some record sales and thats not a good thing for a talented artist like him. You should never stoop to the likes of these pop culture fanatics especially when you're on a higher level than them. One last note I hope he never makes another record like the horrible gunslinger or I'll be forced to give up on him! 
 This is my 3rd Manning published book. They ALL lack sufficient code examples. It's almost as if they don't expect you to EVER try anything out on your own. It's ridiculous. These books are great to read and to learn from, but only if you want to do lots of work to get their horrible code examples working 
 The author has provided the context in which he wrote this book.  As an adolescent boy in the 1970s, I found it an interesting read.  Since I had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book, I am still healthy and have all of my limbs.  If people are interested in improvised munitions and the like, there are at least six (6) US Army FMs and TMs on the subject that I am aware of.  Bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony, and should not be attempted without the proper Federal and State licenses and permits.  BATFE does not take kindly to the making of unregistered and untaxed explosives 
 You're kidding, right? The only good film in the trilogy is the origonal. How dare you try to continue the story of something that cannot be continued. The orgional was good enough. Leave it there. Just because you want money, don't ruin such wonderfull entertainment.  I didn't even stay awake through all of the movie, it was so bad! I'd rather watch Barney with my 2-year-old 
 Sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" and "City of The Angels".  They have failed to correct this error with this newer, supposedly "re-masterd" version.    On the original vinyl release, "City Of The Angels" kicked in before the final chorus of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for "Feelin' That Way/Anytime" on Infinity.  At the time, some AOR radio stations even played these two tracks together.  As completely seperate tracks on CD, the famous ending of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly. Ultimately, it is only a couple seconds cut off (reverb echoing to silence) - But as one of Journey's signature tunes, you'd think that they'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release.  The original ending of 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin" (with final seconds of reverb) can be heard on the two disc collection, Essential Journey - but of course, as the set is a collection of radio songs, it does not segue into "City Of The Angels" as it originally did (and should) on Evolution.  A minor point I know.  BUT - Sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release. They should take the time to check all the details to get it right.  Or - why bother 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 Coach Moore is another in a long line of legends to coach under the Golden Dome.  Unfortunately, Bob Davie is another in a shorter line of terrible head coaches hired by the Fighting Irish.  As for the book, the author (and Moore's lawyer) would have you believe this is a tale of David vs. Goliath in the courtroom, and that his brilliant legal acumen brought the Notre Dame empire to his knees.  Truth be told, a first-year law student could have won this case, and Notre Dame's legal department should be ashamed for ever letting this case go to trial.  Bob Davie ADMITTED in public, to the Notre Dame football team and others, that Coach Moore's age had something to do with his termination.  You don't need Clarence Darrow to tell you that is age discrimination, my friends, and only the arrogance (or perhaps stupidity) of the then-administration at Notre Dame let this case go to trial.  If you hate Notre Dame, maybe you'll find pleasure in their bungling of this matter.  In fact, had Notre Dame not been the Defendant, nobody would think twice about reading this book. There are pleny of better written and more interesting books on the legal system out there.  Oh, and Joe Paterno coaches at Penn St. by the way.. 
 I HAVE BEEN SOMERSIZING FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AND HAVE ENJOYED THE FOOD RECIPES IN SUZANNE SOMERS 3 BOOKS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS DESSERT BOOK.  SO FAR I HAVE LOST 10 LBS AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS WITHOUT STARVING MYSELF.  HER PROGRAM IS TRUELY A WAY TO LIVE BY.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE HER PRODUCTS, BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU MOST OF THE RECIPES IN HER BOOKS, I LIKE THAT!  THIS DESSERT BOOK DID FALL SHORT THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER WONDERFUL BOOKS.  I HAVE TRIED THE CHEESECAKE WHICH IS OK, BUT WHEN YOUR EARLY ON HAVING THE SUGAR CRAVINGS IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, I SUFFERD THROUGH.  WE ALSO TRIED THE ICE CREAM AND THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THE SOMERSWEET MAKES THE ICE CREAM HARD AS A ROCK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD.  I HAVE YET TO TRY ANY OTHER RECIPES.  THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE DESSERTS I AM USED TO ARE ON LEVEL 2, SO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH.  I HAVE MADE A GOOD MOUSSE DESSERT USING SUGAR FREE CHOC PUDDING AND CREAM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ALMOST LEVEL ONE.  I PERSONALLY WOULDNT WASTE THE $ ON THIS BOOK. 
 I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult 
  I can't believe that people have the nerve to compare this to the oringal one with Chris Tucker or even the second. I watched this piece of unfunny white goofball movie and wanted to cry. I really peeved me off that people had the nerve to say it deserved better or claiming that people were only bashing it because it was a black film, but no it was horrible and seemed to need the touch of DJ Pooh and a return of Chris Tucker to make it funny. This is just a crappy movie that needed not to be made. Sorry Cube 
 I imagine there are some useful and perhaps even good ideas here. But the entire text is so self-obsessed that it's hard to see beyond the "travelogue" conceit. Franzosi seems to believe that his story-telling makes the book accessible - but instead it simply makes it annoying. Can one meaningfully go from words to numbers? No doubt the answer is yes. But the techniques for doing so will be best served by a more concise elaboration written by someone with less interest in sharing his stories with what Franzosi seems to imagine as an adoring readership. 
 This is the worst possible way to interest someone in poetry: offering lackluster poems about adolescent topics by contemporary writers of little or no distinction. It makes poetry seem easy, trite, self-indulgent, and boring.  Rarely have I so regretted a purchase. If you would instill a love of poetry in a young person, read them the great, lasting stuff.  If it sparks no fire, then poetry is not for them.   
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 Is this book scientific or dogma? Science employs unambiguous concepts, does not ignore data that contradicts; and revises in the light of valid critique. This book fails all these tests. For a comprehensive critique of its many flaws see Professor Brendan. McSweeney's widely cited paper in Human Relations  (2002) 55.1. To take an example from the Hofstede's book: they state that "the masculinity-femininity dimension affects ways of handling industrial conflicts. In the United States as well as in other masculine cultures such as Britain and Ireland) there is a feeling that conflicts should be resolved by a good fight ... the industrial relations scenes in these countries is marked by such fights. If possible management tries to avoid having to deal with labor unions at all." (p.143). This claim first appeared in Hofstede (1991) and later in Hofstede (2001). Test 1: a national culture does not affect national managers but only national labor. Inconsistent. Test 2: according to the Hofstede's own ranking (p. 121) Japan is the second most masculine country and Germany is more masculine than either the US or Britain. And yet for over fifty years the industrial relations in Japan and Germany have been the least conflictful. The Hofstede's claim is contradicted even by their own data. Test 3: In 2002 McSweeney published a second paper in which he showed that mascluninity-femininity has no predictive or explanatory power in relation to industrial relations. His data showed that sometimes such relations in feminine countries are more aggressive than in masculine countries, sometimes they are less. Despite this data the Hofstede's repeat a claim that is clearly contradicted by the data (others and even their own). A company which believed the Hofstede's claim would be discouraged from considering investing in Britain, Ireland, or the US and would be encouraged to invest in feminine countries such as the Hofstede's Netherlands which they claim is the third most feminine country in the world. Hopefully, not too many are misled by the dogma in this book which bears no relation to reality 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 This is too basic to be helpful.  The author admits taking most of the training plans published from popular web sites where they are published.  It spends sentences describing what other books spend chapters on.  I recommend Triathlon 101 for beginners/intermediates and The Triathlete's Training Bible for experts/intermediates.  Great pictures though (reason I gave it two stars instead of only one)?!? 
 My goddess is the only song worth listening to on the entire album, the rest sounds like soft, slow garbage from SR-71's File 13. Get their new one instead, which is heavier and pure rock. Half of these songs border on pop-punk, and punk SUCKS!! 
 This book is a rip-off. There is no new information in it. It purports to give unique insights, when all it does is rehash conventional wisdom. 
 Milo Ventimiglia (Gilmore Girls, The Bedford Diaries) stars as Zack Harper, a kid who helps out his friend Kyle who is in a bit of a rut. Kyle was challenged by a senior to do the Dirty Deeds. The Dirty Deeds (there's 10 of them) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish. There's also a record that has never been beating before. So, Milo sets out to do the Dirty Deeds and there's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many Milo has done. Not Another Teen Movie!! Just had to say that but its bascially what it is. In American Pie you had Jason Biggs doing the pie and in this, well Milo Ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread (if you know what I mean). Milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie. More moronic characters. My advice is watch it (Unrated or not) once and the decisions are up to you. Also starring Lacey Chabert (Not Another Teen Movie, Mean Girls) of course, Mark Derwin (One Life To Live, Heist), Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean), Panso Gorson (South of Nowhere, Dear Wendy), Billy L. Sullivan (My Life, Little Big League), Ray Santiago (Meet The Fockers, Pinero), Todd Zeile (King of Queens, SNL), Michael Milhoan (American Gun, Pearl Harbor), Erin Torpey (Crescendo, One Life To Live), Arielle Kebbel (Aquamarine, Be Cool), Dave Power (Frailty, Boston Public) and Charles Durning (The Final Countdown, Rescue Me) for some odd reason that I dont know why. What does the Unrated version have to offer? Female Nudity what else?! 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I'm not sure how anyone could possibly sit through this overblown, miscast, boring example of Hollywood at it's worst.  Gary Cooper has to be the most uncharismatic and non-talented actor to ever achieve star status.  It's pretty sad to me that Hollywood felt the need to cast a Swedish actress to play the part of a Spanish girl named Maria.  Were there no latino actresses working in 1943?  Total waste of celluloid and time 
 This item was purchased for a 3 year old, and within minutes of play, the sides popped off, and we were never able to securely attach them again.  The heart clasp at the top also came off, and we were never able to get that to stay on either.  A toy that keeps falling apart is very disappointing for a 3 year old.  This item is in pieces, sitting in the bottom of a toybox 
 I purchased this book hoping for an objective, scholarly history of the life of Mary Magdalene.  However, this book is little more than an assortment of personal attacks on the beliefs of Christianity and the Catholic Church cleverly marketed as a biography.  In typical propaganda-slinging fashion, she paraphrases and condemns writings, events and individuals that go against her personal views while accepting and embracing those that support her beliefs.  While Ms. Picknett clearly conducted a large amount of research, she obviously has many deep personal issues with the church that would be better sorted out through counseling and therapy rather than through the publishing of books.  She condemns the Catholic Church for the (unfortunately) many bad practices of the past without really acknowledging all the good work and teachings done by the vast majority of its members throughout history.  This is analagous with tearing down the entire present-day educational system because of some bad teachers that were around centuries ago.  She certainly needs to learn how to distinguish between occasional faulty leadership versus a faulty organization.  A few bad apples do not always spoil the whole bunch.  This discrete "it's either all good or all bad" line of thinking, coupled with the one-sided iconoclastic attempts to destroy the image of Jesus, are pathetic at best and have no place in any text aimed at those seeking to make up their own minds through an objective presentation of facts 
 James Chace does a great job in listing all kinds of facts and anecdotes about Dean Acheson and his contributions to American Cold War policy. (I think that his book is the only true comprehensive biography on Mr. Acheson out there, too. 
 We read this book in class at the graduate level and her ideas caused a great deal of controversy. Some loved her and others were sure she was radical with no agenda except for blaming others for her anger. I thought that her book was non-academic because it was not an academic piece of writing. Color or gender have nothing to do with it. I was not impressed by her ranting against white middle class educational values because she was a beneficiary of a scholarship that helped her achieve her education. Besides, at least in this book, she can't get past her anger to give real examples of transformative education in the classroom, except to assure the reader she practiced it.  Not good enough.  Playing the race-card, flagrant self-promotion and hate speech is not enough. Being a revolutionary requires more than a polemic against the things you don't like. I wasn't impressed 
 Spong inhabits a worldview in which rationality and religion are remotely distant cousins.  Through postmodern eyes, Spong sets the mythological stage upon which resurrection should be viewed.  For the intellectual, the demise of objective reality and certain historical knowledge are well accepted premises secondary to limitations of language and culture.  To Spong, only the "ignorant," those who are left behind in the dungeon of "premodern ignorance," seek pragmatic understanding of actual historical events, or apply literal interpretation to past reality. Only a "weak," "pitiable," and "frantically insecure" Christianity believes in the historical, physical resurrection of Jesus.  To Spong, literalizing the stories of Scripture and particularly the resurrection of Christ, only serves to destroy faith (i.e., Spong's kind of faith).  In this provocative book, Spong reaches beyond linear time and space to achieve a transcendent, symbolic truth of resurrection, comprehended as a subjective, experiential reality incorporating Jesus' as the ultimate "mythic hero."  Despite his avowed disclaimer against use of literal interpretation of Scripture, he vainly attempts to literally undermine and replace the persons, places, times and events of Easter.  Spong grossly prooftexts and misuses scripture throughout the book.  He conveniently ignores historic and textual evidences toward early creedal development, pre-Gospel manuscripts, well-established oral tradition, and the presence of contemporaneous sympathetic and non-sympathetic witnesses, while using liberal, late scriptural dating to justify his alternative perspectives.  Spong commits the fallacy of special pleading.  Instead of a Jerusalem-based physical resurrection of Jesus on the third day, Spong espouses an actual, initial post-resurrection "experience" by Peter in Galilee.  After wrestling with the finality of Jesus' death for approximately six months, Peter suddenly envisioned that life's purpose is to give love and life to others, just as man Christ had done throughout his life and death.  Indeed, it is not Jesus' resurrection that was critical, but Peter's "resurrection."    For Spong, Peter personifies the true beginning of Easter and springboard of Christian faith, accomplished through his own self-reflection and realization.  Historic conversions from Judiasm to Christianity, as initiated by Peter and spread to the masses, as well as subsequent martyrdom further confirmed the experience of a spiritual resurrection.  Such transformation and sacrifice were merely manifestations of a new spiritual outlook on life as inspired by Christ, but were not caused by the literal viewing of a physically resurrected Christ.  Offering no evidence himself, Spong feebly attempts to dispose of any physical evidence by placing Christ's body in a common grave with criminals, left unidentifiable.  He then ambiguously resurrects the `spirit' of Jesus' life to be both transcendently and immanently discovered later.    And, despite his dogmatic assertion against knowledge of objective reality, he not only proclaims with confident, self-refuting certainty that Jesus actually died in Jerusalem, but that bodily resurrection of Christ, and any literal interpretation of the events surrounding such is a grossly mistaken idea.  This begs the question as to how he has accessible, authoritative knowledge, the very thing he seeks to dismiss.  His dichotomous views prevail throughout.  One positive insight to be gleaned in these pages is Spong's desire and commission to live life unselfishly, guided by the amazing loving, sacrificial example of Jesus Christ.  This book is true to its postmodern roots, a decided effort directed toward deconstruction of orthodox Christianity and reconstruction of Spong's own brand of mythology.  He  separates faith and rational thought, yet appeals to logic to substantiate his own religious knowledge. This is indeed `Spong's story,' a creative legend of his own with the blurring of fact and fiction to avoid direct implications of an empty tomb, to avoid the possibility of the supernatural, to avoid his unanswered questions toward life after death, and to futilely escape any arrogant positioning associated with knowledge.  Spong's spiritual, linguistic and historical reconstructionism rejects critical historical analysis, whether scriptural, philosophical, cultural or secular.   In his own words, this book promotes Spong's "re-creation," his "speculative interpretation" of resurrection; and, the reader should judiciously approach this book as an inconsistent and self-refuting fiction lacking validity or authority.     
 I want to make a short comment here: 1) This book is quite confusing. It mixed up the real story with the make up one. 2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. And Ramanujun is a real genius. I cannot stand this make up part 
 As an avid fan of Hamilton and other great sci-fi writers, I find it difficult to plow my way through Benford's mess. The story idea is good, but Benford's writing is positively awful. At times he can't even seem to make up his mind what tense he's writing in. Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so. I would not recommend this book. I am no writer, but I can recognize great writing and this isn't it 
 On the basis of the ideas contained in the book, it probably deserves 5 stars.  PC set theory is still the dominant framework for teaching both undergraduates and graduates how to conceptualize and analyse atonal music.  However, I have to give the book 2 stars simply because writing is so awful.  Forte's prose is so and unwieldy that I sometimes read the book to help myself fall asleep at night 
 Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10. This magazine is an embarrassment in every angle. It is full of pictures of "sexy" boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear. And pictures is all there is, for you that think there will be something interesting to read, read this: THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS MAGAZINE TO READ!!! The latest issue contains of 48 (forty-eight) pages before you get to this issues contents. The first "article" starts on page 126 (!) and is about "why a man would like to slice of his testicles"! Totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text (letters that forms sentences) on about 40 of them. Besides this, the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not.  Well I can go on and on but I won't. Unfortunately I have a subscription and I am going to see if I can get it canceled, I don't even need my money back. Take your $10 and run them in the disposal, it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than "read" this magazine 
 I bought this book for an advanced marketing class in my MBA program. The authors explain in detail the elementary topics which are covered in basic marketing class. For e.g. they talk in detail about segmentation, but they fail to explain thoroughly clustering and factor analysis.The tutorial also lacks depth and does not interpret the numbers 
 I am very dissapointed with the poor spiral binding on this book, (4th edition)! As a dietetic student, I don't have much money to spend on books as it is. As much as this one is priced, the publishers could have put a higher quality binding on it, (or made it a paperback, like previous editions). Pages are falling out constantly, especially since it the type of book you refer to all the time 
 THis books seems to be a great footage of rock articles. IT presents no definitive theory about the rock industry, nor it gives a real portrait of the rock scenario through the years. It only gives separeted pieces of histories about Springsteen, Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Peter Frampton, Grateful Dead, MC-5 and a handful of others. The writing style is dry and badly developed. DOn't recommended 
 Aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one. For the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible (and unmelodic) climax. There are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring Jungle Brothers and 13 featuring N.W.A. But for the most part the rappers take center stage and Aphrodite doesn't add much. If you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled CD 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 Former Philadelphia newscaster Larry Kane scrapes the bottom of his memories of covering The Beatles and few encounters with Lennon afterward to pad this combination of memoir and hagiography.   Kane covered the Beatle tours as a radio reporter and his book about them, "Ticket to Ride," is considered an excellent fly-on-the-wall account. Here, he takes his material, what little information he's gathered, padded it with bombastic praise for the group and nearly everyone who knew or worked with them then tacked on 33 pages of fan letters. Kane is besotted with Lennon and uncritically takes his side whether John is using his rough tongue on his friends, cheating on his wives or behaving badly while taking copious amounts of drugs and alcohol.  Kane wraps the Beatles in fulsome prose that would embarrass the most hardened egotist. The Shea Stadium concert? "An epic moment in contemporary entertainment" Onetime band mate Stu Sutcliffe? "In the formative years of John's march to eternal greatness, Stu Sutcliffe was a colossal figure." Even Beatle experts aren't spared this trowelwork, with one authority called "the world's greatest scholar" on the group. This fulsome praise makes for hard reading.  Kane's prose settles down when he describes the private moments he shared with Lennon while on tour, and there's a wonderful section describing the weekend Lennon spent in Philadelphia helping Kane's station with its telethon in 1975. The accompanying 40-minute DVD mixes a promotional interview with Kane with a 13-minute interview from 1968 with Lennon and McCartney, and a few seconds of Lennon giving the weather report as part of the telethon promotion. So while there are some interesting bits, it wasn't enough to justify a book. As they say in the record business, I didn't hear a hit 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 This guy is a serious jerk.  Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent.  Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting 
 Brent offers a money-back guarantee at his events, where he would give a reader a dollar if they came up with his book and told them it was boring.  After reading the book, I am ready for my dollar 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that is fine writing, but the book is tasteless. I find Rodriguez arrogant and lonely. Is he trying to say that the turning point of his life was when the nun's came to his parents home. I hate this book it is one of my worst reads ever 
 My pug Ginger got this for xmas and the toy is cute but she can't get her mouth around the toy's belly because it has the retractable reel inside it for the squirrel's tail.  I don't have a lot of room inside to really through this guy around but maybe outside it would fly farther because I'd have room to really fling it.  I am keeping an eye on her when she does play with it because the string from the tail might tangle up or snap.  You never know 
 This story is a sequel to Tess Gerritsen's more original book 'The Surgeon.' In 'The Apprentice' she largely recaps the trauma her protagonist Jane Rizzoli had to endure during the hot summer a year ago. Passages of inner monologue are meant to captivate the reader. Unfortunately, I was not captivated by Jane Rizzoli's rather flat and not very nuanced perception of her surroundings (including her constant feminist offense by anything male). Sure, there is plenty of medical detail of the slayings and forensics; but they do not seem to lend the book any soul. The characters have almost no depth which together with the detailed procedural descriptions of techniques used to investigate crime-scene evidence leave the reader very dissatisfied.    Around pages 200-250 (of 350) the actual plot is finally revealed, and I must admit that Ms. Gerritsen had a quite clever and almost convincing idea to link the series of 'apprentice' killings to a war criminal. But too little is made of this idea. The reader learns almost nothing about the 'apprentice.' Interspersed monologues by the 'surgeon' (the bad guy from her last book who in a run-of-the-mill fashion manages to miraculously escape from a medical ward and who is meant to act as a 'teacher' to the apprentice) do not help.    I would strongly recommend you choose another book to sink your precious time into. 
 These earrings look like pieces of glass; not diamonds--no sparkle at all. I feel I wasted my money. Caveat emptor 
 This was the first of Ms. Peters' books that I read.  Maybe if I had had the background of the other books, I would have found it more interesting.  As it was, I kept thinking "Get on with it already". There were too many exceprts about Nefret and her hubby and then it would switch back to Peabody and Emerson, and it rarely went back to the murder. When it did, there were so many characters and so many nicknames for characters that I was totally confused and often had to go back in the book to see who was who. The setting in this book and Peabody's wit kept me reading, though.  
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 I'm a long-time collector of Froud and a WOF member. This book was purchased by my husband from my Wish List. I was delighted to receive it but was very disappointed in the quality of the edition. A complete set of 24-pages was missing and replaced with a duplicate set. Amazon's Customer Service (always great to work with) sent a replacement immediately but that book was also a a printing disaster. All the graphics had inappropriate color bled into the images (excessive blue, yellow, red). Definitely not acceptable in a book purchased not only for it's amusing text, but particularly for it's artwork. I returned it also as Amazon could not guarantee me an edition without the printing errors.  As usual, they issued a total refund (thanks amazon) 
 Page xiv states, "A copy of the Uniform Building Code is required to use this book," and that is the truth. I wish that information had been available in the reviews before I bought it.  This book does not summarize the code requirements 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 This book has very little quality content.  There isn't much revealed here that isn't found in virtually every other poker book out there.  If you have read any poker books at all, don't bother.  In fact even if you haven't read any poker books, don't bother.  There are far better books out there.  I read the Holdem' section and was left with a feeling that I had been robbed.  Look at Phil Gordon's books and pair them up with Doyle Brunson's Super System if you are serious.  Phil Gordon provides a solid playing style while Doyle's books provide the details behind the decisions 
 My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good.. 
 For those who have never read "new age" mystic like Deepak Chopra or L.Ron Hubbard, or views on the merging of the eastern mystics with christianity, this might seem like a new book. But to most SF (speculative fiction) fans, we've seen this done too many times.   It wouldn't turn a head at the Nebula Awards or even make it as a serial in Fantasy. It's been done so much better by people like Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov or Alfred Bester.  OK, what's wrong with it. Stop me if you've heard this one. Well the premise is from Fail Safe or maybe Dr. Strangelove. The out of control super-computer, with the mind of a maniacal would be world dictator. And the US military is out to blow it up before it can saturate the planet with nuclear explosions. But guess what? The computer is on to them...Oh My...Lions tigers and bears OH MY...we're not in Kansas any longer. (Where are the singing Munckins when you need them!)  Whose going to straighten all this out???? Well, Dr.Tennant, that's who...doh ti dah, dotid di dot ti dahhhhh...able to leap all religions in a single bound, more powerful that quantum mechanics...look up in the sky, it's SUPER DOC! or is it DOC the Christ, Jesus, this was ridiculous at some points.  There is a fine line between profound and unfounded, and Iles has done a great job of tripping over the line. I have read other Iles books, notably "24", and found them interesting and well written. But why do I think if this manuscript was submitted under a nom de plume, it would have been laughed at. Probably because it was past plausibility.  Characterization belongs in a cartoon...mean evil general who beats his daughter, daughter who grows up meaner than daddy, frightened Indian neurologist, stylish eccentric englishman, persevering psychiatrist (and jewish to boot), noble palestinians and mosad (israeli) agents. Our hero is more resolute than James Bond, tougher than Jackie Chan, a better shot than a trained sniper, able to survive on land, air and on the sea....oh and don't forget the crazy billionaire computer genius who wants to have himself downloaded into the mega-computer so that he can live for eternity.  One word, UGH. 
 The author made a huge mistake with this one.  It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all.  This book is a complete waste of time.  The  only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out  there 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 With the burden of ideological narration, this documentary does not provide an in depth look at the history. It does not provide a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are manipulated and edited together with an biased flow, without a good balance of academia and historians involved. We cannot get the "facts" from different points of view. "Goldberg's film presents a slanted historical account, according to some viewers who wrote into PBS stations and a scholar who participated in the panel discussion. If you only take one side and report their deaths, it seems like genocide. But of course it wasn't that, said Justin McCarthy, a professor of history at the University of Louisville. McCarthy, who acknowledges holding a minority view, believes Goldberg's film takes a selective snapshot of history and fails to address the deaths of many Turks at the hands of Armenian militants. "It was an inhuman, bestial time,  he said. There were wide-scale, mutual massacres across eastern and other areas of (the Ottoman Empire) a mutual- extermination kind of war." 
 During a $20 Tarot reading at a Spirituality exhibition, the very un-insightful Tarot reader (who told me nothing significant about my future), recommended this book to me. But I did not buy this book on her recommendation, why would I? She was awful. It was my Mother, who is everything new age and spritual (and the reason why I was at the exhibition in the first place), who bought the book and suggested I read it.  There is nothing profound about this book, in fact if i follow just one of this Authors suggestions, such as talking to every stranger that i lock eyes with (because apparently they have a message for me) not only would i not get anything done, but I would probably be dragged off to the nearest hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. A spotlight reviewer gave this book 5 stars as a comedy, good on him, for seeing the brighter side of this book 
 This was assigned for summer reading in freshman yr at my college. I can't believe gibberish stuff like this gets published. Kingston's past accounts were boring to read about, at times confusing with all the muti-named relatives. The events were and pointless and just blah. I tried to make it to the end of the book, but sadly I didn't. It was just too boring! I would give this less than one star if I could. Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague. 
 I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection ("Trouble is My Business") at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of "Trouble is my Business" to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas 
 If you're interested in the 100 hells of Buddhism and what you will be reborn as in the next life if you live a specific type of way. Or if 1000 years of Buddhist, monastic history interests you, this book is for you. To me its mythology and dogma, with very few practical lessons, if any. 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you. Steve Kiewit 2543 770 623 
 very hard to read, very expensive for what it is. I buy this book for a course of telecommunication, and i dont use it because it is really bad! I sold this book right after i finish the course 
 Richard Rothstein is no more qualified to advise on education than the new governor of California  (who is a body-builder).  The  objective of education is economic self-sufficiency.  Getting ahead in life requires connections, not "knowledge."  American blacks are denied connections.  We all  know why and how.  The black-white gap which Rothstein writes about  is not  information but access.    Valuable  knowledge is learned on the job, not in school. Teachers do not control access, employers do.  Blacks who are told otherwise are being cheated.    Centuries ago schools were for the elite, whose privileged  positiion in life was predestined.  This was not changed by free public schools.  America's political leaders never learned this fundamental lesson.   US Grant  - who in fact  liberated blacks - imagined blacks would quickly join mainstream   America.  KKK put an end to that dream.  Just saying again and again that there is a gap does not  acknowledge the reality.  Ask a bona fide teacher.  When black youth knows  schooling will be rewarded, education will command respect.  Wallace F. Smith,  Walnut Creek, C 
 While you may find Bill Maher's performance "thought provoking" or "vomit inducing" depending upon your political slant, the fact remains that this is an UNFUNNY comedy show.     Bill rants and raves about the same topics he has in the past, but its a political stump speach, not a humorous standup routine.  If you have misfourtune of watching this, you will notice that there is almost no laughter from the audience.  Sure, he gets applause, because he's preaching liberal ideals to Californians, but there is little laughter.      If you want political stumping, turn on the TV.  If you want Comedy, go watch someone funny. 
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 This book of short vampire stories is BAD, BAD, and BAD. The books feels like it was put together in a matter of hours all in pursuit of the mighty dollar. The stories are meaningless, contrived, and a waste of the paper they were printed on. The ONLY REDEEMABLE story in the whole bunch was Angela Knight's Galahad. If she's smart, she'll turn that into a full story to add to her collection of Mageverse. Galahad's story was quite good. We actually read a plot that developed quickly and had a show-down between good and evil. It also explained how another of the three "unholy" grails was destroyed. I'm glad I bought the book simply for that particular story. Galahad deserves FIVE STARS but the book as a whole should simply be left out in the yard for the sun to destroy 
 Having read much of Ann Coulter's book "Godless," I was impressed with her energy, but dismayed by her hyperbole.  Her basic themes about the Godlessness of American liberals are right on target, but she unfortunately goes way over the top in some of her examples and analogies.  Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to check out one or more of the response books engendered by her bombshell.  Being in a bookstore I picked up "Brainless" to see if the liberals had any good response to Coulter's assertions.  Sadly, the author of this book named it after himself, as he is clueless about how to go about writing an effective rebuttal.  The entire book is one long series of ranting ad-hominem attacks that resemble the gruntings of a pig.    Maguire starts out by indicating that if "you are part of less that 20% of the American population who is white, male, conservative, and therefore bigoted, you probably wont want to read his book."  It goes downhill from there.  Maguire's unwitting accomplishment is that he has proved Coulter right - in his case, liberals are completely clueless 
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 In Defense of Secular Humanism is a collection of essays written by Paul Kurtz, mostly in reaction to allegations leveled against secular humanism (and humanism in general) by the Religious Right and other fundamentalist Christian organizations in the United States.  And therein lies the chief problem: it's a collection of essays that are almost totally focused on one central concern. Whereas many other essay collections by other authors tend to cover wide ranges of concerns (anything from war, to ethics, to religion, to sports), Kurtz's collection is focused almost entirely on answering allegations by his opponents.  And since his opponents had a habit of making the same allegations again, and again, and again, much of this book is Kurtz writing the same responses again, and again, and again.  To sum the problem up, there's a heck of a lot of repition in this book.  Of course, there are several good essays, and some excellent ones. Kurtz's "Principle of Tolerance Reaffirmed", "Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle", and "The Democratic Ethic" are very thought-provoking works to read. However, much of the book delves into seemingly mindless repition and even vitrolic rhetoric, which is, in my opinion, unbecomming of a person of Kurtz's intellectual capabilities.   Bear in mind that I do have some biases on this subject. This was my first introduction to humanism, and it's a very poor book for a first exposure. If you're like I was, and looking for something to introduce the ideas of Humanism to you, read "The Philosophy of Humanism," by Lamont.   Ultimately, I would hesitate to buy this book if I were you. If you're like me, and willing to spend the money to add this to your collections (and read the occasional very interesting articles within), go ahead. However, overall the book is intellectually unstimulating, and probably not worth most people's money. These essays just weren't meant to be put together 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one.  I just liked it.  It was okay.  Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors.  I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them.  However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.  I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story.  Very disappointed. 
 I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.  On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did 
 I found this software very difficult to use.  It does not have any "Stop" or "Go Back" button.  The only way to exit an activity is to hit "Esc" button to exit the program and then start all over.  When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there. When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no "links", "tools", nor "examples" mentioned in the book at all! 
 We ordered with great expectations. Print was hard to read; pictures were poorly printed. The text is OK, but we have seen better Tarot guides 
 The title is misleading.  This is a collection of New Wave renditions of traditional songs.  Unless you are a New Wave fan, it may drive you nuts.  New Wave adults may love it.  My baby payed little attention in contrast to  BabyGenius' "Favorite Nursery Rhymes" which clearly draws his  interest and smiles 
 Buyers beware, the Bible commentaries are written by liberal theologians.  They tend to disbelieve miracles and try explaining away Devine prophecy by assigning late dates for the books.  When I was reading the commentaries, I couldn't help but get the feeling that the writers were trying to destroy my faith.  Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it.  All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible.  It reads like skeptics and non-believers wrote it 
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 I was so excited to purchase this CD.  The reviews were so glowing and enthusiastic about the music.  I was sure I would love it.  Well......I didn't.  The music was all right, but surely not the most beautiful I'd ever heard.  And, I discovered that I could hear an intake of breath after every phrase.  I found this to be very distracting.  I will most likely pass this CD along to my mother, and if she doesn't like it, it will probably go to Goodwill 
 I used to live on Corfu (and it's an island; therefore, it's "on" Corfu, not "in" Corfu!) and first stayed there about 2 years after the author first set foot on Corfu.  I have been going back there ever since.  This book is a terrible disappointment if one is looking for plot, character development, reader involvement, etc.  However, it's wonderful if one is an architect, a civil engineer, and/or a horticulturist.  This is the first book I have bought in a long time where I wanted my money back!  I found myself skipping page after page after page, in sheer boredom.  One can read about lovely flowers and sea only for so long.  After that, it would be nice to know a little bit about the society, the politics, the people, etc., of which we get precious little in this book.  A horrendous waste of time.  And if I felt that way and know (and love!) the place well,...I can't imagine what a reader who has never been there would think.  A great soporific.  Please, don't waste your time 
 This is the DJ who singlehandedly ruined a once great radio show, KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic, formerly hosted by Tom Schnabel and Chris Doritas. Harcourt's Brit-Pop content free taste is unlistenable, especially at 9:00 AM. He's a genius at ferreting out silly, souless crappola. Happy reading 
 I was mislead by the title of the book; I was looking for GENERAL information about the how and whys of home schooling from a non-denominational point of view. I plan on teaching my child about God and  religion, but not as part of my home schooling cirriculm. I wish I had  known about what the book was really going to discuss 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I ordered the plates and they were warped, like they were from the outlet mall. I was very dissapointed 
 I detest this printer.  I've bought quite a few printers in my day:  Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits.  The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on.  It just died on me.  I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again.  This time for good.  I returned it, got another one...same problem.  Except this time it keeps going.  All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on.  Nice, huh?    Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure.  No more el cheapo models.  I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
 Filled with false and unproven theory. If you want lack of science then check the background of author and contact the University of Utah. There was no research  only conjecture by the author and law suits for false advertising of a cortisol weigh loss product - Cortislim. One study on cortisol was based on Salmon swimming upstream. No doubt stress can be bad, it can also be good, as when you need to run really fast to find some good science 
 Tiny print. However, there is lots of empty space.  Try DESIGNING A PHOTOGRAPH instead.  Most disappointing purchase.       
 A CROSS WITHOUT HELL IS A CONTRADICTION: READ THE APOSTLE'S CREED.  I fully agree with the UNPOPULAR reviewer "Andy Grey" who gave it one star.  It is impossible for annihilationist to comprehend sin and the law of God both of which are linked to the doctrine of hell.  They annihlate the law and sin with hell.  The endorsers deny Anselms teaching of the infintie debt and Why God Became Man.  Instead buy the book "Eternal Christianity" by Jim Cronfel to read all of the quotes from this book if the denials of sin and the law and the atonement and justification.   PATRIPASSIANISM IN THIS BOOK:  "There is no question now of the Father inflicting punishment on the Son or of the Son intervening on our behalf with the Father, for it is the Father himself who takes the initiative in his love, bears the penalty of sin himself, and so dies." p 152  DENIAL OF ETERNAL SIN BEARING:  "God in Christ bore our sins and died our death because of his love and justice, we must not think of it as expressing eternal sin-bearing in the heart of God. What Scripture does give us warrant to say, however, is that God's eternal holy love, which was uniquely exhibited in the sacrifice on the cross, continues to suffer with us in every situation in which it is called forth." p 329 - 330   DENIAL OF PARDON BY ATONEMENT:  "Nor, as we have seen, has Christ by his sacrifice prevailed upon God to pardon us." p 173  SEE THE PATTERN DEVELOPING?  Andy Grey is currently running 3 for 44 helpful votes.  Goes to show that the truth is sparce and the path is narrow.  I ask: do the "unhelpful" voters deny sin themselves? are they saved? or are they in it for popularity 
 I read this book before I ever read his column which I found to be extremely stupid in its quippy sarcastic humor. Basically he makes it sound like he and his boyfriend didnt want to do the stereotypical gay couple things so then decided to adopt.  His perception of the process to becoming a parent really sounds like they were getting  a new accesory.  In his favor, I've seen Savage on Bill Maher and enjoyed him, I just cant stand his column or this stupid book.   
 i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it's release why? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on HD or Blueray or a new 2 disc DVD set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie.. 
 Gardner, an English professor, decided to take the (first) monster from Beowulf, and flesh it out into a full-blown character.  Beowulf's Grendel lasts about 5 minutes.  He terrorizes the Danes for 12 years--breaking into their mead-hall by night and eating selected warriors--for no other reason than that he is evil (descendant of Cain) and hungry.    Then Beowulf and the Geats show up, and, in good Clint Eastwood fashion, Beowulf dispatches Grendel bare-handed--tearing off his arm and shoulder and sending him bleeding home to die in his swamp.  This takes longer for me to write than it does to happen.  In short, in Beowulf, Grendel is a bit player.  Gardner gives him a childhood and a psyche full of angst and neuroses that would make Hamlet seem straightforward and decisive.  The book, having not much subject, is vastly overwritten--many too many adjectives, and many too many attempts at Anglo-Saxon "kennings" (pithy two-word constructions like "world-rim-roamer").  The character of the Dragon is interesting, if overwrought.  But Grendel himself is simply teenagerish: narcissistic, constantly complaining over nothing, excruciatingly self-aware and self-important.  Beowulf is great poetry but a dull plot.  This book is dull poetry and an inflated, equally dull, character.  Gardner, by the way, was emboldened by the commercial success of this to write several other novels.  Pity.  As a critic, he was great.  As a novelist, wordy and empty 
 This book contains almost nothing you wouldn't get from any decent Multi-level Marketing company. He does however spend a great deal of time hyping his other books and tapes. If you are interested in starting a MLM company yourself his advise consists of get a lawyer. Rated 1 star because you can't rate it 0 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 I got a whole six months use out of this unit before the battery would no longer charge.  This is apparently very common for these units.  Check out some of the forums around relating in particular to the battery problems.  I checked with Palmone and it will cost $120.00 to replace the battery plus shipping (they will only replace at Palm).  What is the point in buying a $200.00 unit if you have to spend another $120 after six months? You are better off buying a Zire.  
 I read this book while doing research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL, the Complete Book on How to Curb your Cursing.  I give the editor credit for the compilation, but for what purpose?  Some of the expressions are clever,  some are funny, but most are not.  People who read this book looking for  new ways to express themselves should determine if they will come across as  amusing or just crass.  While I believe the basic word has some value,  promoting its use is a social disservice. The fact that the book has  received so many favorable reviews reflects the decline of civility and the  dumbing down of both our language and our concept of what is funny. My book  has an entire chapter on this word that is not only more amusing, but also  thought provoking 
 I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 A poor documentary. An attempt to make porn acceptable and very unsexy at that. A repulsive movie.   Watch instead the recent made for TV series entitled Rome.  The series Rome is accurate and entertaining and without a doubt the best of its type ever made 
 The first ten minutes of this film seemed promising but unfortunately it never quite came together for me.  I only kept watching because I was vaguely interested in who the real "Dori Lawrence" could have been.  (Online sources think that it is perhaps an actress named Sarah Holcomb.)  In the end however, I didn't find myself really caring who the real life actress was...and even the fact that this film is "based on true events" doesn't make it any more relevant and/or "real" to me.  I think it maybe tried to cover too much in too short a time period and it just came up short.  Parts of it were certainly interesting, but in the end the film as a *whole* couldn't hold water.  There are just too many holes.  My first comment after the first fifteen minutes:  "This looks good, I think I'll have to borrow it and watch it again."  My final comment after the credits rolled:  "Huh.  Actually, I don't think I liked it. 
 i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it 
 Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else 
 I bought this item as a replacement for the GX300, which lost the ability to format discs (a common problem for this model). I was told by the Sony Rep. that the GX330 was identical to the GX300 except for some improvements. WRONG. Everything about the newer model is different, as in "worse." Even the menus were different. Several features that I liked on the older model were left out, such as a 3rd line input. But the real shocker - are you ready for this - THERE IS NO WAY TO PAUSE LIVE RECORDING. Unbelievable - but true. I'll be sending this one back 
 I bought this book for christmas. I had hoped to improve my knowledge of upholstery through it, but I was dissappointed!. This book has only black and white MINI pictures!!. How in the world can one learn to upholster with black and white pictures. These pictures are so bad that they sometimes look just like a black patch? For me, buying this book was a big waste of money. An upholstery book with no good picture is not interesting to read and very very boring!! 
 Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues. 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!! After 12 books its still not over, my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this! (and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned 
 If you think a book must be depressing, hopeless, and about unhealthy people who don't really want to change, than this is the choice for you.  It is well-written, but pointless, falling into the genre of fiction about pathetic losers failing to find any glimmer of happiness or meaning or joy or redemption.   I am not suggesting that fiction must be happy, but this book is just too much about  failure and mean-spirited revenge.  There are no good guys.  The main character watches as his little girl's life is destroyed by his wife, and doesn't stop it!  Or even try to stop it. Angry and Hopeless: and do we need another book about such people? Sure, there are such people: by why wallow in their misery?  
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 Nothing interesting, stupid and boring, A girl with a sick mind likes to have sex with dead bodies, I'm sure it has happend at one time or another somwhere, but it does not make an interesting movie at all.  75 minutes that felt like 750 minutes, I saw the uncut version, you could see her breasts and bush once, that was it ! Don't waste your time on this pice of crap if you have anything better to do 
 nothing new here same sound same dity's no strecth here just a jam session with no quality. borin 
 This is a completely useless strategy guide. Why? Because Gran Turismo is a racing game. What can a guide teach you that you can't possibly learn by playing the game. Now, I know what you're thinking: Why am I reviewing this if I think it's useless. Because I wasted my money on it, that's why, and I'm going to bash into the ground and attempt to scare others from wasting their money as well.  Pros and Cons: + Pages 292-295, which contains a list of the cars you win racing certain events.  - It "describes" driving techniques. How many have ever passed a driving test by only reading the driving manual and never actually getting behind the wheel?  - It analyzes car manufacturers, which can be fun, but it's also something that's been found in car magazines throughout the world.  - It gives you maps of the race course and the key turning points, once again "describing" how to take the turns.  - The guide has a kind of "extras" section, that actually bores us with the past Gran Turismo titles and how they affected the industry. We know how it has affected the industry, because their have been FOUR titles.  - Then, it tries to squeeze money from you by advertising, in a section all its own by the way, other GT items (hats, DVDs, a steering wheel). This wouldn't have bothered me had they placed it at the back of the book but it's closer to the middle.  - Finally, it has all the websites of all the car manufacturers, another way of shamelessly advertising things most of us can't afford.  Some of you may think that my "cons" are actually pros, but when you think about it, a strategy guide (which they cleverly titled "Game Guide") is supposed to aid you in the game. The cons listed are all the things I thought didn't help me. As you can see, I only liked four pages. Needless to say, I don't recommend this guide. You can learn more by actually experiencing the game than reading this guide 
 I fist saw the book offered in a knitting catalog in November of 2005 and was eager to purchase the book and put to use some of my lonely skeins of yarn.  They nor several other companies that offered the book were able to get it from the publisher.  I kept calling these places on a weekly basis and one company even called me and told me they were giving up on the book.   In July of 2006 I discovered it on Amazon and placed an order and it arrived in no time.  After skimming through the book I was disappointed that I put so much time and effort into trying to obtain the book.  I was inot impressed with the patterns offered in the book.  The patterns in the book one can find in most other knit books 
 This book explores the fascinating relationship between brain functionality and "religious experiences".  However, it is rambling and somewhat disconnected, and could have been condensed to a long magazine article.  It also suffers from a significant flaw in reasoning.  It starts from an assumption that religious experiences are real (and universally desired) and this colors the conclusions the authors draw.  The authors reason that:   1.  Some people have "religious experiences". 2.  These religous experiences are real, universally desired, and connect the user to the spiritual world. 3.  What part of the brain allows people to connect to the spiritual world? 4.  How has this been useful in mankind's development?  The assumption that the religious experiences are real is not a valid basis for a scientific experiment.  One of the basic assumptions of an experiment cannot be that something exists when that something cannot be tested or verified.  The entire set of experiments should have been:   1.  Some people have "religious experiences". 2.  These are likely measureable through blood-flow changes in the brain. 3.  What part(s) of the brain is affected and how does this change take place?   4.  How does this explain the power of religious experiences? 5.  Can this change be taught or duplicated through artificial means, and if so, what does that tell us about brain chemistry?  This is a subtle but very important difference.  Regardless of the religious beliefs of the scientist, scientific experiments must have a firm, verifiable foundation.  The authors have allowed their beliefs to cloud the interpretation of data on a very interesting subject.  The result is a pretty good new-agey spiritual book, but a flawed scientific one.      
 More garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that Washington had "No Idea" about the 911 attacks and that they merely screwed up. This book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to Washington pre-knowledge; actually,I think Mossad did the dirty work. I get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney American Dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in Red China. The complicity of the American sheeple is beyond belief! Every body is willing to become a suck up like Stalins Yezhov or Beria believing everything that is said to them, then Bang, right in the head. What will you Sensible, moderate sheeple say when the North American Union 2010 and Shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement. Another similiar piece of garbage that advances the "Innocent view of the CIA and Washington" is E. Howard Hunt's Book "American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA" Completely sanitized of any useful information. If a book has any truth to it, it will be either "Out of Print", Extremely expensive or the Author will have died of lead poisining ( Gary Webb, Gurudas, David Allen 
 it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
    Contrary to what is all too kindly asserted by a few friendly reviewers, obscure rather than brilliant, mannerist and unquotable as its style is, Death of a Discipline makes one thing clear: the author thinks and wants to make us believe that Comparative Literature IS dead (and had been long comatose before she dealt it the last blow). Since she has later confessed or pretended that she refers to a very obsolete type of American Comparative Literature only, being ignorant of other critical sites, this would be no news at all and could not severely hurt our scholarly sensibilities, if Prof. Spivak had some coherent and well informed approach to offer in the stead of this "old Comp. Lit.". But the "New Comparative Literature" she advocates has little to commend it, if we judge by the scientific looseness and wildly eclectic name throwing of her own practice in this book and generally in her critical and theoretical production of the last twenty years.    The discipline Prof. Spivak actually manages to kill with this book is the very "Subaltern Studies" of which she was reportedly the founding Mother. Many academics around the world, including the most knowledgeable in her own country of origin, India, have repeatedly denounced her abuse of deconstructive techniques to justify the erratic fragmentation and savage distorsion of classics and non-canonical texts alike in order to serve a supposedly radical political vision, which I would summarize simply as "multiple jingoism".    The confusingly extremist views developed in this book have nevertheless made a "must read" of it for a couple of years, it has been widely reviewed and debated in many forums, and almost every single paper in the forthcoming ACLA decennial report of 2004 refers to it. I suppose its use, in the long run, will have been to help restore a good measure of intelligent solidarity and sanity (against an identifiable imperialist threat) among the less nihilistic World Literature teachers and researchers across all five continents. It was fortunately the general tonality of the Jubilee Convention of the International Comparative Literature Association (Venice, September 2005) with 170 participants from many areas, including South Asia, East Asia and the two Americas.    
 Having read Tales of the South Pacific, one of the classics of 20th  Century literature, I couldn't wait to read this 'sequel' by Michener. I  wished I hadn't bothered. It seemed as if the great wordsmith was just  writing because his publisher demanded to cash in on the success of  'Tales'. Disappointed, I put it down about a third of the way through and  never bothered to pick it up again. It takes two to tango - even in a  novel. Michener (the author) and I (the reader)danced our way through  'Tales' never missing a step. With the sequel it was if we had two left  feet 
 This book is good for young artists and young artists only. If you're a kid who just wants to enhance your doodling skills then buy this book! The markers it comes with are water based, cheap, and nothing like what the pros use. If you are over 13 or you are young but want to become a very serious artist do not buy this book! you should buy: How To Draw the Marvel Way by Stan Lee. That book is quite a bit more advanced and involved for drawing your favorite Marvel characters and for creating your own characters 
 This book was good in that it has some interesting ideas about the future, mortality and aging. This might have made it recommendable.  But the story didn't have any meat on it. It was actually pretty boring and ultimately a disappointment. And for this, it's not really recommendable 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 I am personally dissapointed to admit to my friends that I actually purchased this cd. I am a big fan of DMX and the entire Ruff Ryder team but this cd is just flat out horrible. My only question is why is Jay-Z(Roc-A-Fella) on this compilation cd. That in my opinion is the worst part of this cd 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 I bought this version when I could not find my old copy.  On trying to find a favorite passage (Darwin's revulsion at a parasitic wasp in Brazil and the inconsistency of such cruelty with any providential design of nature by a good God), I noticed that it was not there.  I do not know what else is missing. I find it infuriating that this was not adequately noted on the cover of the book.  I always prefer books as the author wrote them, especially when the author is Darwin.  This is a lively, beautiful and haunting work that I first read when I was thirteen and have read twice since. Readers deserve the whole thing 
 I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.  Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.    Just lists.  Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.  Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back 
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 I bought this product looking for a good drum machine that I could use alongside my keyboard and in the software Reason 3 on my PC to input midi data for drums.  This seemed perfect.  First impressions are very poor.  The machine is toy-like, with only a 3-digit LED to communicate to the user making the interface awkward.  There are a selection of built-in rhythms that suggest it is intended for absolute beginners rather than experienced musicians, and the overall feel of the product is cheap and nasty.  The drum pads are unresponsive.  If you hit them, more often than not they do not sound.  The touch sensitivity is laughable, with hard hits often sounding quiet and vice versa.  The footpedals that come with it are pure Fisher-Price nonsense, unweighted and often unresponsive.  So much for the hardware.  But the biggest crime is the selection of sounds: desperately unimaginitive percussion sounds are on board, with an almost depressingly poor selection.  The snares all sound like a variation of one another (increased pitch for one, reverb for another, etc.)  There are several sampled, but they all sound very similar.  The same goes for the bass drums.  Whilst there are electronic toms (though not in any of the preprogrammed kits), you have to hunt for them and there is no electronic snare/bass to accompany them for that 'electronic kit' feel.  Even the tabla/congas are poorly represented.  In short, the sounds lack any of the imagination and subtlety one would expect of a dedicated drum machine.  I would guess they have been taken off of one of Yamaha's less expensive portatone keyboards.  The MIDI implementation is truly pitiful, with no way of adjusting any of the MIDI settings as far as I can tell.  It will not work properly with Reason 3, anyway.  You can tell I'm not enamoured with this product.  I would advise anyone looking to buy this to try it out first if you can, as it left me with a bad taste in the mouth and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in saying that.  I would have expected better from Yamaha, especially at the incredibly high price they are charging for what is essentially a kiddies toy 
 The stool is great as far as it's ability to function.  It is quite thin which makes it easy to store.  It does have a safety issue!!!!! My 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together.  I almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion.  My husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus, no more pinched fingers.  I would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around.  I was right there when  my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger 
 My preschool classes have all loved MUD PUDDLE.  The repetition with in the story is great.  We love to have an excuse to shout, "Hey, Mud Puddle." We've even made up actions to go with the bathing and dressing portions of the story.  I love this author and this is by far my favorite of his stories 
 This book is OK, but considering how many books are out there on this subject, I'm amazed at its high cost.  Unfortunately, my professor chose this book for our class, so I need to get it.  On the positive side, the book is available at our library so I will just photocopy the needed articles without having to actually purchase the book.  Professors, please think about the cost of the books you require your students to buy.  This kind of price gouging in the textbook market has to stop 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 This book is an obfuscation rather than an elucidation of Wong's films. If you use the word "teleological" frequently and think the following fragment from one sentence makes sense--"...because of the messages encoded in the ambivalence of the film's 'linguistic structure' - ambivalence that arises from the 'insertion of history (society) into a text and of this text into history' as Kristeva defines it..."--, then you will probably love this book.   Having recently discovered the films of Wong Kar-wai, I wanted a book that would tell me about him, his ways of working, and that would discuss his films in a way that would be meaningful to a reasonably well-education person who does not and did not work in academia. Because this book does have some of this information buried within it, I can't trash it completely. But, I will call it pretentious, pseudo-intellectual B.S. And, I will certainly avoid any more writings by Mr Teo.  Amazon's physical description of the paperback is filled with errors. The book is 191 pages rather than 212 pages. The publisher is the British Film Institute and not the University of California Press. The listed dimensions are wrong. Also, the subtitle listed by Amazon does not appear on the book's cover or title page.   If you must have a book on Wong Kar-wai, then go ahead and buy this. You will get a small amount of useful information and a filmography. The price is inexpensive enough to justify the purchase. 
 This is likely the single worst statistics book that I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. This is definitely on of those "look how smart I am" books and lacks any real practical use. It's full of contradictions, vague information, and generally stinks to high heavan 
 This book was edited by Hienlein's wife, Virginia.  If you have read Tramp Royale, you will already have seen that Virginia seemed to be a vain and foolish woman, dull witted at best.  This book certainly affirms the dull witted concept.  It is overly catagorized, with many sub-catagories containing only one fragment of a letter.  As a result, a striaght through reading jerks you all over the calender and back again in the space of a few pages.  Very annoying.  This would have been a far better book if the fragments had been presented in the order they were written 
 I've enjoyed Melody Carlson's adult novels.  They tend to have realistic characters and give a far more complex, nuanced view of faith and the world than a lot of Christian fiction.  This novel disappointed me a great deal.  The characters are one-dimensional and the plot could not be more simplistic.  Basically, it boils down to this: don't have sex, because God's greatest concern with teenage girls is the state of their hymen (their actual one, or maybe, like Beanie, their spiritual hymen) rather than of their heart.  Perhaps the most insulting, disgusting part of the book is the final page where the fictional character in the book tries to urge readers to sign a chastity pledge.  Can you imagine how much better this world would be if young Christians were encouraged to pledge themselves to feed the hungry, comfort the afflicted, and visit the imprisoned, rather than to not have sex?  How wonderful it could be if their energy and passion were turned outward toward helping the "least of these"--the poor, the sick, the outcast, the people Jesus served--rather than inward toward perserving their "sexual purity"?  Unfortunately, that is not what's happening, and books like this are a part of the problem 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc, the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc, and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad.  all this without any systematic mathematics.  hurrah for the chinese.  alas, like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor, all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared, somewhere either burnt, or submerged in tar.  but speculation continues.  meanwhile, spaghetti was invented there, without which no italy would have arisen.    oh, and crackers, they invented crackers, and bed posts first 
 Wonderful movie and an advertising lie. I hate, hate and HATE it that I was told about format it was closed-captioned, and then I got the DVD disc with no English subtitles. It significantly reduces a value of the cultural artefact. End of review! Damn it.  Zoran, Amsterdam 
 I purchased this anticipating using it with my mp3 recorder as well as my camcorder.  Ordering and shipping was great through Amazon. When I received it, I tested it with my mp3 recorder. My test subject was the television about 8 feet from me, playing at a normal listening level.  My first test, I got very little sound; so I adjusted the input level of the recorder to it's highest level.  The resulting level was enough to hear.  Since I was planning to be able to record lectures at 3-5 times the distance of my test, I knew that this mic alone would not handle the task.  Yesterday I tried it out recording the children's Christmas pagent at church.  The difference in sound over my camcorder's builtin mics was amazing, though there was a low level hiss.  However, there were two things that made me decide to return it.  The first was that there seems to be little or no accoustic isolation of the mic elements and the microphone body; it picked up the slightest touch of the camcorder and even normal touch on the tripod.  It even picked up the motor noise that the internal mic does not.  The second is that it is highly susceptible to electrical interference.  With the mic off, I got a radio station, and when I touched the mic, I heard a buzz.  I removed the mic from the supplied cable, and even the noise I got touching the connector end, wasn't nearly as loud.  I really expected more from Audio Technica, even for a mic at this price 
 I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted.  The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc.  Very disappointed 
 I used to enjoy Iris Johansen.  This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as "psychological thriller", but it's not.  If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good.  If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one.  The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds.  The other main character also does that.  Yes,that is the basis of this book 
 Nine is a beautiful show... one of the most amazing shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I did not see the revival, and this recording does not in anyway make me wish I had. Antonio's performance is extremely flat. It all seems so calculated and rehearsed, which is not at all Guido's character. Guido Contini is charming, smooth, and a con-artist in many ways. Antonio missed that completely. I saw his performance on the Tony Awards show, and it made me want to cry. There was none of the character I loved so much there.  The other performances were, for the most part, ok to good. None surpassingly great, except Chita Rivera, who, sadly, does not have enough to do to save the show.  Get the original 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books 
 Having read reviews prior to purchasing the book, I thought, it can't be that bad. I was wrong. All of the reviews are accurate and true descriptions of the book. I purchased the book as required text for a graduate introductory course in data communications. What can you do if you're stuck with this book and you must read it " for class"? Read the summary at the end of each chapter FIRST. This might help you grasp what the author is trying to say in a long, extended, technical and scientific way.   The book includes scientific descriptions of data communication. Perhaps the book is extremely on point for engineering students or someone with interest in creating a data communications or telecommunications system from scratch for an organization. However, addressing the issues from a business perspective is not the primary focus of the book. Reading the chapter demands utmost concentration and the ability to extract key concepts about the subject under discussion. It is not clear why this book seems to pop up so often as the required text.  There are many books that address data communications from a business perspective. It is an arcane academic selection as required text for a non-engineering data communications course.     
 save your cash.this is a letdown collection.don't misunderstand:that's not to say that hammer studios failed to live up to their usual great standards concerning the horror movie genre;it's the powers-that- be that determine which movies go into a particular collection.no studio makes great movies with every attempt;hammer's no exception to this rule.there's really only one good movie in this collection(evil of frankenstein):brides of dracula is also passable.everything else...junk 
 The Ant Farm is a wonderful educational toy, but the quality is disappointing as other reviewers have said.  The plastic has rough, unattractive edges from manufacture, and the bottom is not perfectly flat, so it can wobble a little bit.  None of this will matter to my nephews, but certainly the manufacturer should do a better job 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 Amazon never sent the correct order.  I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item.  I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop-tarts.  They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12 
 The activities introduced in this book are common sense only.  Don't waste money to buy this book 
 It doesn't make discs worse.  And it doesn't fix every possible scratch.  Some people here think it'll fix severely damaged discs.  It is intended only for reasonable damage.  However, I spent $49 for the motorized version at Best Buy.  It worked and I'd give it about 9 out of 10 rating scale on fixing the library's badly scratched discs.  But a year later (maybe less!), it appears as if the internal gears are stripped.  Apparently the gears inside are plastic and don't last long.  Unfort., there's not much choice on CD scratch repair machines to choose from.  I am forced to have to buy the manual version now, or go back to what I was using before - a drill-powered buffing wheel and car finish buffing compound.  
 You know the feeling...that feeling of "Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?"  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it 
 This CD fell far far below my high expectations of Sting.  I found it unimaginative, sounding much like many of his earlier pieces 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this dope, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 I would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided.  It seems Spike Lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid, racist, phony, or downright evil.  I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.  Lee had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video. Spike Lee doesn't mess with fantasy, only with reality and his reality is black and white. It is infact fantasy, and pure propaganda 
 our MFC - 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldn't be fixed by the sales technician.  Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in website.  They waited out the warrenty.  Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this 
 Readers can easily expect that an anthology of poetry about anarchism might be difficult to assemble given that few identify themselves as anarchists or write about anarchist themes.  Yet somehow Visions of Poesy: An Anthology of 20th Century Anarchist Poetry manages to cobble together 267 pages of versification.  I say "versification" because many of the entries do not qualify as "poetry" by any reasonable definition of the term except for their end-stopped lines.  The tragedy is the anthology's evident lack of poetic values unintentionally reinforces the erroneous notion that anarchism promotes chaos.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Anarchism promotes the order that results from mutual and fully-informed consent.  It opposes imposed order.  Apparently, in their zeal to create the impression that anarchy generates considerable poetic activity, the editors have left the impression that anarchism hasn't produced much poetry that is worthwhile.  A much shorter work retaining the few gems this anthology contains would have benefited this work and anarchism better. 
 ...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.  If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.  If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.  If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.  It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards 
  I found this book insufferable, and didn't get very far into it. His attempt at deep philosphy and poetry fell flat with me. Can't a wound simply bleed because the vein is open? Can't the surgery ever simply fix the problem, allowing the body to heal? Others, apparently, like this kind of stuff. If you don't, steer clear!  
 Bad plot, bad acting, bad filming.  The surprise ending was a surprise because I had nearly terminated this boring, stupid film long before.  The actress playing the little girl was especially poor 
 I am editing this review for clarity. No, I am not talking about carbon.   This is one of the best Brita filter systems I've used. I also use the large water cooler model that offers hot and cold dispensing, and I've used several pitcher sizes over the years. This large dispenser fits almost anywhere and holds far more water than the pitcher sizes. The valve works perfectly and closes securely. So, if capacity is more important than portability, this is a great dispenser. Because of the valve, kids can use this much easier than they might a full, large pitcher.  My only problem with it is the mould-like stuff that grows in mine. No, that's not the carbon all us Brita users are used to ignoring. It's fuzzy stuff that grows in clumps and sticks to the plastic and is very hard to remove. Maybe that's because the large upper reservoir remains damp and closed longer than a smaller pitcher system would and because it's upstairs where my air conditioning doesn't reach. It's hot up there most of the year.  And because of the relatively small, but convenient, filler opening, it's not easy to see into the reservoir through it. So, it's easier to just keep filling without looking into it until filler time. I was going to discard this, but after realizing that nobody in the household got sick, I decided to keep it. I'm leaving the one-star rating in place because I can't edit it, and because I'm tired of household members who complain about the growths. Hey, that's what the faucet is for. What do they think grows in there? 
 I couldn't read past the second chapter.  Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.  It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".  "Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.  I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks.  
 If you want to read a book on risk management, this may be not the book to read. This book is interesting as an applied math book for say some application in risk management but not as a risk management book. The main application of this book is credit risk. What does the reader learn ? Nothing about how to compute the spread of a CDO's tranche, nothing about how to manage correlation risk, nothing about how to  manage spread risk, nothing about the real value of the calibrated intensity and nothing about the real value of the spreads. Needless to say, you will learn nothing about the new indices such as i-traxx for calibration. As a risk management book, it is a rather poor book. However, you will learn many things on time series, stochastic intensity models, copula and so on. In fact, the right title is "Mathematical and Statistical methods for risk management in view". Bearing in mind that this is an applied math book, it is well written and contains a lot of material that can be interesting. As a consequence, this book is rated with 1 star as a risk management book but with 4 stars  as an applied math book. 
 I only hope this doesn't signify the end of his career. Any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with "friends", it signals the end of a career. Look at Santana. The guy can't make a solo album anymore. This is what happened to John Lee Hooker. Musically, this albums lacks the care Clapton used to give his music. He used to be a careful, calculated musician who knew how to rock. Just bear this in mind if you buy the album. You may want to enjoy this CD with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of Depends. And a members only jacket. Clapton just doesn't know what he wants on this album. Blues? Jazz? Easy Listening? Ho-Down Appalachian Stomp? Hee Haw? Crooner?   Eric, make up your mind. Then give us a cd worth a listen 
 After reading the positive reviews on this book, I was so looking forward to reading it.  I could not have been more disappointed.  The book is simply not the fun and humorous book I was expecting.  It is boring and not very funny.  Many of the insights about Christmas in the south are accurate but they are not presented in way that is entertaining.  It's a great idea for a fun book but this one just doesn't work 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 I wouldn't purchase this title. Afi has said several times that they had no imput into this album, that it was ONLY a Nitro Retrospective, and that they didn't really want it made 
 I purchased this CD for only one song, Una Palabra by Carlos Varela.  It is the very first track.  Come to find it is a shortened version of the original song.  The full version is 2 minutes and 27 seconds.  The version on the soundtrack is 1 minute and 14 seconds.  Why someone would want to cut 73 seconds off such a short but beautiful song is a travesty.  Why it's madness, I tell you...and my soul demands justice!  Luckily I was able to find the full version on the internet, but of course that was $14 later.  All kidding aside, it's not a bad CD entirely...if you're into that Harry Gregson-Williams hooty-tooty crap.  As a matter of fact, I encourage you to get into him.  Just so happens I got a CD for sale if you're interested.  Say...$13.99 
 I got the impression that this book was something the publishers asked Father Greeley to dash off in time for Christmas.  Same Irish-American hero from Chicago with large family, same strong heroine that said hero worships.  Yawn.  At least she was Russian this time; that added a bit of interest to the story.  Don't get me wrong, I've read all of Greeley's fiction, am a big fan. It's usually much more interesting, with actual plots and villains and such.  This was just a bland little holiday story 
 As an attending/assistant professor of anesthesiology I frequently recommend books for residents to read. I still recommend this book, but with the caveat that much of the information is outdated and some of it is no longer even held to be fact. The underlying theme of the book - that comorbid states influence anesthesia and vice versa - is still true. I tell residents to get a used copy or wait until a new edition comes out 
 I cannot rate this item. This item was on backorder and I have never received it 
 Director Michael Bay had some good ideas about blowing stuff up but absolutely no clue as to structuring an interesting, intelligent and engaging story. Even with blatently ripping off the far superior Tora! Tora! Tora! he still manages to produce this amazingly boring and inept clunker.   Why Hollywood has to shoehorn love stories into every second movie regardless of their subject matter is beyond me. Let's see Micheal Bay do a film with a love triangle about the atomic bomb. Couldn't get much worse than this. You can comfortably fast forward through three quaters of this movie and not miss much.   The second star is for blowing stuff up. Overall not a fine example of film making 
 The author of Unholy alliance and Sinister Forces-The Nine, did not write this book. If he did it was another personality.  Did he double?  Like he claims so many have or could have? Maybe the Nazi's did get him in South America, and wiped his memory, if not the nazi's, then someone did.  This book was slop. Almost as if someone else wrote it. Some adolescent. The other reviewers are correct, BIASED is plain language. How he can blast the RNC while no mention of the filthy treacherous dirty deals of the DNC, or a reason to praise the Clinonistas is beyond belief. They are BOTH dirty. There was no honesty here.   I guess with all his research ability, he chose selective or "erased" the memory of Mena Arkansas!   It was a sloppy FLUFF center to his oreo "Grimore". Which in book one led you to believe he had a premise that would lead somewhere. Ramblings on message boards are better written. The author of Unholy Alliance did not write this book. Disgusted. ROBBED 
 I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel 
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99. 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 very bad quality, not worth to buy it. it is not as good as the picture. Don't buy it!! 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 This DVD is terrible and I regret purchasing it. The worst thing is that during the cardio workout, the instructor is not going to the beat of the music AT ALL. She is so off. I personally cannot stand when workouts are not synched with the music. And the video looks like it was put together on a shoestring budget. Do not buy this video if you expect a nice, high-quality workout DVD 
 How much of ESPN's history can Freeman botch and still publish a book? Quite a bit, it seems. An author who writes about a sports network should at least know the difference between various leagues, especially the difference between major and minor leagues and which teams are in which 
 I was excited to read the book because it talked about even how unattractive or intelligent women can be seductresses.  However, all the author talked about was how the various artists, intellectuals, and adventurers used sex to get what they wanted from men.  Basically, the author reduces women to physical beings and tries to justify this treatment by comparing the women in her book to the Sumerian goddess, Inanna.  There was no everlasting love for these women, a myth if there ever was one.  And then Prioleau claims that if women reclaim their sexual selves, they will gain the everlasting love that has been eluding them.  Essentially, the book is BS and I wouldn't give this book to anyone.  I would actually advise friends and family members to avoid it at all costs.  It just perpetuates the image of women as sexual creatures to be used by men in exchange for power, money, fame, and security.  
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 The problem with Johnson is simply this: awful scholarship. In theology or scripture, one should not by into a school of criticism and then try to mold the truth to fit an ideology. Johnson's ideology is modern feminism, and she willfully tries to create an image of Mary in this book that fits this paradigm. That this image is not based on truth should go without saying. One cannot throw away scripture, logic, and reason and expect to produce anything except subversion. This author freely admits this, saying that it is time to read the story of Mary subversively. I humbly disagree, and defend truth, as revealed through scripture, tradition, and magesterium of Holy Mother Church.  One of the things that bothers me most about Johnson is the thought that she might be successful in her efforts to undermine our Lady. Ironically, in so doing, this dissenting theologian may destroy developing Christian unity. As Rev. Charles Dickson, a protestant pastor, points out, Catholic dogma about Mary, when viewed correctly, is largely Christological. Rather than express the Immaculate Conception negatively i.e. "by saying Mary was preserved from the stain of original sin, we may put it in the affirmative and say she was preserved in a right relationship with God." (Dickson) Given the fact that Mary was chosen by God to be the mother of our Lord, this teaching makes sense, and finds support in the scriptures. Arguing that Mary is our just our sister with no special graces, gifts, or attributes defies logic, and the scriptures themselves.  Again, to quote Dickson "To appreciate Mariology in proper perspective is to recognize that it is vitally related to our understanding of anthropology, Christology, and soteriology. Scripture, Tradition, and reason are compelling arguments for the entire Christian community to revisit our thinking on this controversy and to recognize the importance, for all Christians, of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. In opening, or reopening, our minds as the case may be, we may well be establishing new avenues of communication in the quest for a greater and meaningful Christian Unity." (Dickson)  We are already seeing this occur. In the excellent book "Mary - A Catholic Evangelical Debate" authors Dwight Longnecker and David Gustafson go head to head on Mary. Longnecker, a convert to Catholicism, defends Catholic doctrine articulately in the face of a very competent challenge from Gustafson. This book, which comes out of ECT (Evangelicals and Catholics Together) is a clear example of the search for truth via serious dialog and debate.  What if Johnson is successful, and we Catholics abandon our traditional view of Mary? Then  the Orthodox Church would stand alone in making the case for Mary's special role in salvation history. This is asking our Greek brethren to do far too much of our heavy lifting. When one looks at Mary in Patristic thought one sees a view of her as Theotokos that is beautiful and inspiring.  I strongly suggest Luigi Gambero's "Mary and The Fathers of the Church" published by Ignatius to get a picture of Mary in the early church. We ought to defend Mary, not slander her.  Finally, a personal note on the role of Mary. My wife read snippets of this book and became quite angry. Growing up, Mary was in many ways her mother in the absence of her birth mother. To say that all women love Johnson's vision is a crass overstatement. Mary became my wife's mom. She didn't need a sister who was just as flawed, and marred as she was. She needed a mom. And no, a maternal image of God is not a substitute.   Mary is my mom also. She was human and real just like us. She was a creature, like one of us, but she was also the mother of our Lord: Theotokos. This is not a vision that is in anyway oppressive, unless one views the traditional roles of mother as oppressive. Hence Johnson's book and her agenda. Modern feminism reads wife and mother as inferior. Nothing could be further from the truth. I relate to Mary as mother because Christ took the time, with spikes through His feet and hands, to give us to her by adoption.  Johnson cannot accept that because modern feminism is more important to her than the truth 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 Worked poorly for me.  I live about 15 miles from the transmitter(s).  No channel was received properly (i.e., without significant drop out).  Gave up and bought a Channel Master CM4228 8 bay UHF antenna.  This worked great in my attic.  Don't waste your money, get a real antenna 
 I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South.  I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change.  In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination.   I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway.  On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have.  This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to  fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date 
 I gave it such a low score not because the book is badly written, or one cannot understand it, but rather because it is not very informative and I'm not sure to whom is it addressed.   If you are already have an interest for Objectivism or Ayn Rand, and might want to learn somewhat deeper into the subject, this book won't help you much. It is an introduction, but since it rarely explains where the claims of Objectivism comes from that it is not a very useful introduction. In this case one might do better going directly to another book.  If you are like me, and you only want to read one book on Objectivism because it was brought up in a conversation or something similar, this book will probably not satisfy you, since again, it makes claims that are not even remotely backed up.   The author spends most of the book saying that Rand gives way to an objective moral and ethical system. To me that sounded like the most interesting part of Objectivism, and yet the author never stops to explain how this is so. I wouldnt have expected the full outline of such a system in an introductory text, but it would have helped if even a little of the path was shown, or even delineated. Instead we are asked to believe (with no reason for it) that this is so, and we are kept this way through the whole book.   All in all, I found the book disapointing, and it was unable to answer my passing curiosity on the subject. If you are more interested on the subject, I would also recomend that you go for another book where a more indepth analysis is shown 
 The basic message was "trial and error" which, while it may be true, gives the reader no foundation upon which to build. Over and over, the authors related how professionals might approach a certain shot but that we needed to use trial and error to find how we should hit it, rather than to give some solid principle to begin to build our own process 
 A very very dangerous book reminicient of the McCarythite past of this country where decent people whose views clashed with the right-wing bullies; were lynched and intimidated in public discourse.  There should be a huge outcry against books such as these whose merits are dubious and whose sole motivation is political smear and revenge.  Typical of a neoconservative icon like the pro-Israeli Horowitz whose fellow neocon warmongerers scared the American people into the invasion of Iraq and now dangerously Iran...  American better wake up and smell the fifth column of neocons amongst us. One of their trademark traits is their consistent reliant on fear and shameful exploitation of world terrorism to further their agenda for Israel, a country they'd die before they criticize.   It is precisely in that motivation that honest academians are being crucified in his hatefest Horowitz calls a book.   As is always the case, its best to question and do some digging about the source that smears before you latch onto his fears.    It then goes into length about history of the Democratic Party and how it has nothing, nada good to offer. A fact which is interesting considering the author's own lovefest with the Party when he was a 60's hippie.   If Horowitz seems content in bashing his own roots so be it because that in a nutshell is what this book is about, exposing what Mr. Horowitz's considers his own shameful past.  Highly recommended for the easily brainwashed amongst us 
 I got into AFI with the release of Art of Drowning, which is a fantastic album.  My girlfriend at the time had Black Sails in the Sunset and even though I didn't really get into it then, I now think it rivals AOD.  AFI has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress (this is highly commendable).  These two albums, which formed my introduction to AFI, now stand as the mid-part of their career.   The band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what's cool.  They've always been unique.  Their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80's and early 90's hardcore punk scene.  Davey Havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says, "Ever since I can remember I wanted to be in a hardcore band," at the beginning of the "He Who Laughs Last" video.  These albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene.  When the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark (it was there in the early days, though, in songs like Brownie Bottom Sundae).  These middle albums (haloween ep and self-titled included) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound.  Moreover, I've yet to hear a band in the world of punk (past and present) who's music rivals this intensity.  I appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level; they continue to break the mold (the goth glam influence is pretty cool).  Besides, who can say they didn't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on Black Sails and AOD.  But, personally, it's pretty difficult to listen to Decemberunderground.  AFI deserves all the respect in the world but I don't feel much of the fire of the old days.     
 I wouldn't even give this toy a 1 start rating......we bought it for our kids for Easter and it hasn't blown one bubble for us....first the tubes were pinched off so we fixed it, no bubbles.....so we cleaned it per the instruction manual,STILL no bubbles!!! I have however poured bubbles over the feeder area and got lots of bubbles that way......but to use it the way its meant we haven't had any luck!!! What a disappointment!! 
 de K0UNX.  I know radios.  I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago, used it for a weekend and returned it immediately.  Even in the Denver market, with lots of very strong HD signals, this radio had trouble finding them.  I'd be listening to a strong station, and the radio would lose lock, go silent, and rebuffer before coming back to life.  This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it.  I have since purchased a Sangean HDR-1 and love it.  Read my review under the Sangean HDR-1 
 What is this Lincoln cult that Dilorenzo speaks of?  Last time I checked, pro-Southeners like Shelby Foote (RIP) were saying the same admiring things about Lincoln as all the Lincoln jock riders that DiLorenzo despises so much.  Seriously, I have no problem with bringing Lincoln to task for his mistakes -- but this guy seems to know absolutely nothing about the political and social context of the civil war years.   Secession is legal:  Even the doughfaces in Buchanan's cabinet though the union unbreakable--as did most of Lincoln's own party.  Secession is criminal -- so said James Madison.  If he doesn't know what's constitutional, who does?  Read Chisholm vs Georgia 1793, McCullough vs Maryland 1819.  Or Webster.  Or better yet, Andrew Jackson.  Tariffs:  The total revenues of the Federal government in 1860 amounted to $56 million with a population of 34 million.  Federal taxation per capita amounted to less than $2 per person.  Yes, the Slavocracy were lightly taxed on luxury goods imported into the south -- goods that they "earned" by wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces.  Then again, the Federal government before the war lost close to 9 million dollars every year delivering mail in the south because of decaying roads and an archaic transportation system. (They profited heavily in the more modernized north.)  What's funnier than hell is that the Confederacy itself placed tariffs on exports. Hypocritical.   civil liberties:  Yes, evil King Lincoln suspended habeas corpus -- actually he was goaded into it by Seward, who feared an invasion of the capitol.  Jefferson Davis suspended habeas corpus, too.  What does Dilorenzo think about that?  Unfortunately, Dilorenzo hardly ever brings up the virtual identical actions of the Confederacy or the fact that liberty was stepping on even harder during the Revolutionary War (thanks, in no small part, to Dilorenzo's hero, Thomas Jefferson (read Jefferson and Civil Liberties: The Dark Side).    Jeff Davis -- responsible for conscription, martial law, suspending habeas corpus, shutting down newspapers and making southerners carry id cards.  Confederate jails were filled with men like Parson Brownlow of the Knoxville Whig, who rotted in one of the Confederacy's "libertarian" prisons for two years for describing the average southern soldier as brainwashed by the Slavocracy, dirt poor yet bragging that he should be allowed to bring his slaves into the territories.  colonization:  Actually DiLorenzo's hero Thomas Jefferson, in one of his more antislavery moments, was the first president to mention colonization as an effective solution to the race problem.  Lincoln went along with it -- even the most militant abolitionists like Chase supported colonization -- publicly until he got Northerns to grudgingly accept the idea of enlisting black troops, then never spoke of colonization again.   
 Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort.  I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome.  Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad.  Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics.  Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them.  These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this.  
 If you already own "Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques" by the same author, then this is going to be alot of review for you. Most of the book is just much of the same information contained in aforementioned.  Unless you are seeking a heavy dose of more of the same, no need to  purchase this one, stick to the first book, which should serve you well as  a reference 
 I like travel books that have a sense of adventure, and where one identifies with the writer. This failed on both acounts, and after struggling through half of it a I threw it away. 
 This book is what I would call hard to read, unless of course you already have a masters degree in Florentine art. As a student in an art history class that required this as one of our reads, I can say this book is crap, yes I mean crap. I have read many more well written books covering this subject in an easier to read format. I would defiantly not recommend this overpriced piece of firewood 
 This book was not enlighting, alot of the information was out date. The phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc 
 Well, I have seen the One Interactive Show book, and quite amazed with what I have seen, so I expected the same visual richness from this book, but I was wrong. This book mainly focuses on dull, not-so-cool websites. Ofcourse, as we all know there is more to interactive design than web design, but this book doesn't have that broader perspective 
 In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it 
 Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of "King Solomons Mines". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic "Prisoner Of Zenda". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution. 
 pretending that 3-6 never happened (don't we all wish that!) this flea bag starts with ms.curtis hiding out as the head mistress of a private school(with a false name what kind of back ground check did they use on her) and still living in fear of her brother michael. well as you can guess he's back and still a little pissed off that she became a star and he has had to do all these bad sequels.    nothing new here and nothing worth seeing (but at least we do get to see jamie and her late mother janet (playing her "pyscho" role once again) act together for what would be the last time).  just a waste of time but i hope it helped put ms. curtis's daughter in collage, as that is the only reason i can think of that would get her back into this mess 
 I was excited to see that NFL films had finally released some collected footage of the 49ers' dynasty era.  The DVD leaves much to be desired, however, as it glosses over each SF super bowl season.  This set spends precious little time developing the great niner teams, and chronicles in shamefully sparse detail the context of these players, seasons, and super bowls.    Example: Missing here from the second SB against Cincinnati was the early Ronnie Lott hit on Ickey Woods, which was a defining moment in the game (and an all-time NFL films highlight).  Ronnie later stated, in reference to that play, that "all hits are personal."  This oversight (as effective as any other), illustrates the lack of detail and understanding that went into this effort.    Die hard fans will buy this one no matter what.  The previous reviews (all negative) didn't deter me, but you should know that this set is a poor collection of reels that doesn't speak to the greatness of those times.  
 This was not my favorite or most useful book for when I set out to homestead. Although it has a lot of good information in it, it is too dense and hard to read through, and too hard to find info immediately as I need it. I read it occasionally, but found the Storey books much more useful for practical, look-it-up-now information. 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 This book is a waste of time and money.  I was turned off because the author actually advises you to lie and misrepresent yourself in many situations.  While reading the book I spent a lot of time trying to figure out if the advice was a joke, like during the section, "Practice you mingle on a nerd."  The advice is clumsy and probably won't help.  If someone comes up to you at a party and says, "how's life treating you?" they probably read this book 
 No, not my type of book.  I really hate to put this review on here with all the other wonderful reviews about it! lol;  however, I guess people do need to hear from those of us that have differing opinions. I really thought I'd like it after reading IJ's 'A Magnificent Rogue' - but I was wrong.  It was very slow reading & I was having a hard time staying in it then the heroine started acting extremely stupid & the hero turned into an a real jerk.  I suppose I would have to say that due to his raising, he might have actually come a long way in life, but I still couldn't enjoy either the hero or the heroine.  So... I can't say I'd recommend this one 
 We purchased this for our 2 yr old son for Christmas.  If you create a perfect track (amost never happens) and don't have too many turns, Thomas will follow it most of the time.  This was a complete waste of money.  It really dosn't work as expected.  If I had a chance to try this product out I would never have bought it. 
 This is a very disappointing book. The information is so shallow and superficial that to waste a student's money on this book would be a shame. Teachers should expect to spend time explaining how the author makes the most interesting contributor and subject, boring. An adolescent and largely inaccurate attempt at what could be an interesting subject. Check out the Lynn Pocock and Judson Rosebush ÒhandbookÓ for a valuable student reference book in digital media. Don't waste your or your student's money on this one 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 I am very dissapointed with this router. It has slowed down my connection speed to a snails pace. I downloaded the firmware upgrade and changed the propety settings as suggested by linksys but this router still lags. I cannot use it to play online games or logon to my company citrix server without experiencing long delays when communcating. I have a sprint/pcs aircard on my laptop and it has a faster connection speed than this unit! I had a belkin 4 port/wireless router that I was using for 3 years and never had problems like this. The amount of time I wasted and frustration I have experienced trying to get this unit to work properly doesnt make it a deal at any price they are asking. Maybe it works ok for basic email or chatrooms but Good Luck getting it to reliably transfer data at high speed if you rely on your router. I give it 1 star because it did connect to the internet. 
 In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.   The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!   In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan.
